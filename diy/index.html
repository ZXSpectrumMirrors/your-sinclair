Those of you who still have the original YS magazines might still have the original YS binders. However, time hasn't
been gentle to the mags. The wire that ran down the centre of of each magazine rubs against the centre pages
over time, making the paper fold weaker and more prone to tearing whilst being moved out of the binder to read, or even
whilst being read when inside the binder itself.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people might not even have binders for their magazines, and so they're either being stored
in large unruly piles or in ugly cardboard boxes.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what's the cure? Simple - make your own!<p>

<font size=5 color="yellow"><i><b>The Binders</b></i></font><p>

The new binders are made using an A4 box-file - these are strong cardboard boxes that are about 370mm high, 245mm wide and 75mm deep.
One of the largest sides is on a hinge so you can open the box and get the contents. The magazines are held in place
by a spring-loaded flap that presses all the magazines against the side of the file - this allows you to store the files
on their end without harming the magazines.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each file holds a year's worth of magazines. However, as the magazines that came out in 1992
and 1993 are very thin (sigh...), you can store all of those in just one file.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All I've done is create a spine for each of the boxes that displays the YS logo, the year,
and the covers of all the magazines for that year. I've also created a spine that spans 1986/87/88 and 1989/90/91
that displays the YS logo across three binders. It's a <i>very</i> nice effect, but it does mean you'll need all three
year's worth of magazines to be worthwhile!<p>

<font size=5 color="yellow"><i><b>What You'll Need</b></i></font><p>
<ol>
<li> An A4 box-file for every year's worth of magazines
<li> An A4 printer, preferably one that can print in colour
<li> Pritt Stick
<li> Sellotape
<li> Sticky-backed plastic (optional, but protects the printer paper nicely)
<li> Something to cut the paper in as neat a way as possible - I used a combination of a steel ruler and stanley knife
<li> An image of the spine you want to print out (see below)
<li> A graphics program that can handle PNG images, and can print out the image scaled to fit onto a piece of A4 paper - 
I used Paintshop Pro
</ol>

<font size=5 color="yellow"><i><b>Instructions</b></i></font><p>
<ol>
<li> Choose which years you want to bind together, and whether you want to use the three-year-wide spines.
<li> Download either the high or low resolution image for that spine:<br>

<li> Print out the image using your favourite graphics package, making sure that:
	<ul>
	<li> Page margins are as small as possible
	<li> The image is scaled to fit the page
	<li> The image is <i>not</i> distorted, so that the aspect ratio is maintained
	<li> That you're printing in colour
	<li> If you have a choice, that you're printing at the highest possible quality
	</ul>
<li> Let the page dry for a minute or two.
<li> Now to stick the paper on the spines...
	<ul>
	<li> If you're printing out the one-year-wide spines:
		<ol> 	<li> Trim the excess of paper so that there's
an identical amount of white space either side of the YS logo and magazine images
			<li> Smother the underside with Pritt Stick
			<li> Press the paper firmly onto the spine of the box-file ensuring that the top edges meet
and that the paper is as centred as possible
		</ol>
	<li> If you're printing out the three-year-wide spines:
		<ol>
			<li> Smother the underside with Pritt Stick
			<li> Arrange three box files together so that they're laying on the side opposite the side you're 
glueing onto, make sure that the bottom sides line up precisely, and press the sides together so that the files are as
tightly pressed together as possible. The three spines should form a perfect rectangle
			<li> Press the paper firmly onto all three of the spines, ensuring that the top edges meet
and that the paper is as centred as possible
			<li> Using a single, swift cut, slide a blade down between the files, separating them again into
three parts
		</ol>
    </ul>
	<li> You should now have individual binders with paper glued onto the spine. To protect the edges of the paper,
put of piece of Sellotape along each edge, wrapping the tape around the corners of the box-files so that they're neat.
	<li> Trim off any excess tape - you only want to cover and shield the edges of the cut paper.
	<li> If you have any sticky-backed plastic, you could cover the entire piece of paper with it if you'd like.
	<li> That's it!
</ol>
