<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">30th December 2001</FONT></b> : Finally got around to catching up with the work I'm meant to be doing on here.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;YS Adventures added up to YS60. All hints and tips to appear in <a href="http://www.the-tipshop.co.uk">The Tipshop</a> soon.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Rage Hard article about Ex-Basic and the HATE preview have been added courtesy of Alan Maxwell.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that screen resolutions are getting higher and higher, the 256x192 pixel screenshots are looking smaller and smaller. Now you can magnify them just by clicking on them.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HKM screenshot added courtesy of John Coyne.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">18th December 2001</FONT></b> : <b><font color=red>500,000 UP!!</font></b> We've topped the half-million visit mark! Still no site update - hopefully will do one over the holiday period.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">12th August 2001</FONT></b> : Not alot happening, but expect a small site update "soon" as I'm currently scanning all the YS Adventure columns for <a href="http://www.the-tipshop.co.uk/">The Tipshop</a>, and this site will get the full articles. I might as well mention that a few minutes ago we got our <b>400,000th visitor</b>, and that this site celebrates its fourth birthday on Thursday the 16th. Nothing is planned for it this time around, although feel free to play on the <a href="hurdieho.htm">Swedish Speaking Sinclair Spectrum</a>. I've also updated the <a href="author.htm">About the webmaster</a> page with a new piccy and updated the details slightly.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Future plans for this site? Not sure, but after I've done the scanning for YS Adventures, I want to break off further OCR work to have a bit of fun. I want to finish off YS HyperCapers (very old alpha <a href="http://www.the-den.clara.net/hypercapers/">here</a>), and then play around with VRML - want to do something based on either <a href="articles/headoverheels.htm">Head Over Heels</a> or <a href="http://www.knightmare.com">Knightmare</a>. Plus there are various other programs I want to write, including Java versions of the Dicing With Death and Dogfight YS board games. We'll see - the fact that I've been wanting to do these for a few years already should tell you alot about the sort of timescales involved for completion :-)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be honest, anything can happen once I've done all I want to do for The Tipshop. Once I've had a holiday and a bit of a ponder, you'll no doubt see some "interesting" results on here. I think that the website has more than enough articles on it to be going on with (I think it's still the largest archive of its type on the web), so will diversify what this website offers. I'm also getting a few ideas for the next Flash movie, so that's something to look forward to. I haven't done a major one since the "Bond" one in 1999, although I rather liked the Xmas card I did last Christmas.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, this is turning into a bit of a ramble, so I'll sign off now. Hopefully you'll get an idea of where I want to take this site from this History entry. Things will be fun, I'm just sick of scanning articles! :-)<br>

<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">1st July 2001</FONT></b> : More advert and inlay scans added.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<table align=right><tr><td valign=top><img src="gettip.gif"></td><td><img src="articles/tips.gif"></td></tr></table><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">6th June 2001</FONT></b> : All's been quiet on this website, but there's a good reason for it - I've been working on another! I've got together with Gerard Sweeney and, backed by a high-calibre team, have put together <A href="http://www.the-tipshop.co.uk">The Tipshop</a>! We're aiming to be <i>the</i> central repository for all game hints, tips, maps, solutions, hacks, POKEs.... you name it, we want it in there. You'll notice that the site is now peppered with Tipshop icons - click on these to search the Tipshop database for any help for any given game, just like how the WOS buttons search WOS for a particular game. I hope you like it - it now covers over 2,000 games, with a total of nearly 4,500 entries, and we're only just starting!.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">1st May 2001</FONT></b> : Around 100 screenshots added, courtesy of Gerard Sweeney and Daren Pearcy!<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">29th April 2001</FONT></b> : Some more screenshots added, courtesy of Daren Pearcy! Also added a Typo Reporter at the end of each article - with over 750,000 words on the site, there are still a few typos hanging around, so here's an easy way of reporting them.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">28th April 2001</FONT></b> : Slideshow applet adapted so that it can handle a screenshot slideshow for each compilation review. Also generated a list of <a href="missingscreens.htm">Screenshots Wanted</a> so that I can fill in various gaps in the site.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">13th April 2001</FONT></b> : A ton of screenshots added courtesy of Gerard Sweeney! Also made some minor formatting changes to the Letters pages - if you see any weirdness, let me know.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">3rd April 2001</FONT></b> : <a href="articles/ystop100.htm">The Official YS Top 100</a> article added, courtesy of Stewart Edgar. Plus a few more Speccy screenshots from myself to fill out some of the gaps in the Arcade Screenshots section.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">2nd April 2001</FONT></b> : Letters for issues 25-48 (1988/9) added.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">31st March 2001</FONT></b> : <a href="articles/scanindex.htm">Scans and cartoons</a> handled a little differently. You can now view a thumbnail of a scan before downloading the full-sized version. Relevant Doodlebugs and Next Months added into the Letters pages.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">17th March 2001</FONT></b> : Letters pages added for issues 1 to 24. Not too sure about the layout of the pages yet (any suggestions appreciated), but it's still a work-in-progress with more Letters to come. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stuart Brady has provided a better screenshot for SAM Astroball.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">10th February 2001</FONT></b> : In moving towards the unofficial aim of this site by becoming a pretty front-end to the <a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/">World Of Spectrum archive</a>, I've added thumbnails of game adverts and inlays to each of the relevant articles. It really is incredible the feeling you get seeing the old adverts again, especially big names such as <a href="articles/outrun.htm">OutRun</a> where the images were so strong. Whilst I'm here, I'll also say that doing something like this makes you realise the vastness of the whole World Of Spectrum project, and also how far it has gone already - I found the relevant scans for almost every single game that has a review on this site, including some quite obscure ones. Martijn van der Heide has done a lot for the Speccy scene by setting up and running this archive, and deserves all the praise he gets.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">16th January 2001</FONT></b> : The relevant Spectrum screenshot has now been added to each <a href="mame/index.htm">arcade screenshot page</a>.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">14th January 2001</FONT></b> : A shedload of <a href="mame/index.htm">arcade screenshots</a> added - now hope to cover every single game that was converted to the Speccy and is emulated by the MAME arcade emulator, so expect everything from <i>Space Invaders</i> to <i>Street Fighter II</i> to be included. Two more articles have been added - reviews for <i>Motos</i> and <i>The Fast and the Furious</i> have been typed up by Jamie Percival - many thanks to him for doing this for me!<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">1st January 2001</FONT></b> : <b><font color=red>HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!</font></b> Mind-boggling fact: in the year 2000, including things like web-spiders, minders, etc, this site got 150,168 visitors (up 50% on 1999) generating 624,714 hits (almost double last year's figure). Plus, in the next couple of days, the web counter (which actually hand-counts visitors who are using web browsers rather than automated processes) is about to hit the milestone figure of <b>250,000</b>! Blimey... More stats (for those who like that sort of thing) in the <a href="stats/all.htm">Stats Section</a><br>
