I've never heard of them.
Where do they live? What do
they eat? Do they wear
headbands over their eyes? I dunno. <I>(Okay
then, James, how come you've got a
Turtles pillowcase, Turtles pyjamas and
slippers and Turtles seat-covers for the
car? Answer that and stay fashionable! Ed)</i> </b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Well, all right. I <I>have</I> heard of them, but I still don't
know all their names. Anyway, here they are on the
Speccy, large as life (well, as large as a small
cauliflower anyway). The game is a version of
the coin-op and you've got to rescue Splinter
and April from the clutches of Shredder. All
people I've never heard of, by the way.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It's a horizontal scroller with the odd platform
chucked in to make things that bit more fun. You
have to rush from left to right, killing everybody
you meet and, er, that's about it. Occasionally
you'll be introduced to some really tough guys (or
dudes, as I'm supposed to say cos it's the Turtles).
Cos they're so rough, you'll need to use all your hacking,
slashing and maiming skills to defeat them.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Obviously you can choose which Turtle to
play and each has his own weapon and style of
fighting. I haven't got a clue which one uses
which weapon, but they're about equal in fighting
ability. Oh, and you can also select whether you
want two player mode. If you play with a pal the
violence quota is doubled, and you've got twice
the chance of getting to April. Whoever she is.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br><b><I>On with the bodycount! </I></b><br>
Once you've set up the game on your faithful
Spec, you're plunged straight into downtown
New York, where everything is strangely
monochrome. You barely get time to sit
yourself down and have a nice cup
of tea before some nasty men run on. From
that moment on it's Fight City, USA as you
kick, smack, gouge and punch your way
through the levels.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Each Turtle uses his own weapon, but they
can all kick, roll around and jump up and down. After
playing for <I>ages</I>, I reckon that the flying kick is the most
effective move. Time it right and you can waste entire
screens of baddies.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If you're into counting how many people you've
killed, there's a meter at the bottom left of the screen.
My best score was about 200 before the Turtle was
wiped out. <I>(Oh, yeah? Ed)</I> It's possible to have over six
enemies all gang up on you at once, so your poor
hands will be red raw from all the frantic joystick-waggling. Usually the baddies only need one or two
hits before they die, but the end-of-level dudes are
something else! Rocksteady and Bebop are tough
chaps and they can take immense
punishment before dying, so
concentrate all your
firepower on their evil little
heads.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br><b><I>Turtley, erm,  awesome. I believe! </I></b><br>
<I>Turtles: The Coin-Op</I>, let me just say,
is incredibly playable. Unlike a lot of
beat-'em-ups, it starts off quite easy
with only two blokes attacking you (who
you can lay out with just one punch). Of
course things get harder, but you
should just about be able to keep on
top. I'm usually crap at beat-'em-ups,
so this is excellent.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It's only monochrome, but the
graphics are pretty big and clear, and
the animation is great. Everything is
fast and smooth and you can forget
about bad response time and joystick
lag cos this is one speedy game.
Hurrah!
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
What else? Oh yes, there's a huge
variety of baddies. As well as
Shredder's henchmen (with their
knives, dynamite and man-hole
covers), there are robot thingies and
rats. There's also plenty of weird
looking guys (like Krang,
Bebop and Shredder)
and even people in the
background, who just
stand there watching
the action).
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There are 15 levels of
this mayhem so you won't get
through it too quickly, even though it
does start off pretty easy. Luckily you get a lot of lives
and, if you're feeling a bit run down (you've got an
energy meter as well, by the way), there's usually
some pizza lying around for you to nosh.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<I>Turtles: The Coin-Op</I> isn't an earth-shatteringly new
concept in Speccy games but it certainly is playable,
exciting and set at just the right
difficulty level. So rush out and buy
it. If you don't like it, paint me
yellow, call me Patch, dress me
up in a flowery smock and dump
me in a small village near Milton
Keynes. <I>(No! Ed)</I>
