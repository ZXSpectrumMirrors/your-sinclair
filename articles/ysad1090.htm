A plea for help from a wrinkled old adventurer. No, I'm not referring to myself, you cheeky monkeys. I'm talking about <b>John Stephenson</b> of Birmingham. John calls himself a wrinklie so I won't be able to offend him. Well, he might be but that's just too bad. He'll forgive me if I can come up with some help for him on a wrinkled old adventure, namely <I>Operation Colossus</I>. This was published about four and a half years ago on a tape magazine called <I>16/48 Computing</I>, but my files are clueless on the title, and I can't find a reference to it in any of my Kind Souls lists. Someone somewhere must have played it, and even if you've not solved it you may be able to help John with his problemettes, namely how to get into the moat, what to do with the rope and tree, and what to do in the workshop after lowering the truck and starting the engine. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know if <b>Brian Scott</b> of Calne in Wiltshire is a wrinklie, but he's certainly in a right old pickle with Tartan Software's <I>Prince Of Tyndal</I>. First Brian says, "I cannot get rid of the demons." Easy, you need the sword. Next question. "I cannot get the sword out of the ice." Oh, I see. Well, that's easy too - you need the torch. "I am unable to get the torch." Hecky-le-pecky. Throw the vase at it... don't tell me... Ah, Brian doesn't mention the vase so maybe he's got it, but just to be on the safe side, and I think I'd better, you must dig at the sandbank. "And in <I>Harvesting Moon</I>..." Oh, we solved that in the July issue, so with a mere touch of the Return and Tab keys we come to... 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next paragraph. Star of this one is <b>W Thompson</b> of Newcastle-upon-Tyne. That's the address to write to if you want help on <I><a href="thepawn.htm">The Pawn</a>, <a href="sixinone.htm">Red Door</a>, <a href="adventuregreats.htm">Velnor's Lair</a>, Apache Gold</I> and <I>The Island</I>. So why isn't this reader in Kind Souls? Just to keep you on your toes, me old chipmunks, that's why. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further help is on offer from <b>John Devlin</b>, Doncaster, Yorkshire. John boasts, and quite rightly, that his <I>Bard's Tale</I> party is now beyond the 130th level, so if he can help anyone struggling in the lower reaches of the game just send your questions and stamped addressed envelope to him. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if that weren't proof enough of John's Mensa-like intelligence he's also written his very own adventure, <I>The Curse Of The Werewolf</I>, and asks how he might go about selling it. What else could I suggest but that he immediately buys a copy of that useful little tome <I>Adventures On The Spectrum</I> (by Mike Gerrard) which contains a chapter telling you how to do it yourself. I've resisted plugging my book for months, so I think I deserve a quick one, so to speak. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Nicholas Sweeney</b> of Middlesborough is the next letter on the pile, and, my word, he's just bought my book. What a coincidence. His verdict? "I enjoyed every page." What, even the blank ones? Nicholas has also got kind words to say for Zenobi Software - "I was amazed at the speedy service, and very pleased by the quality of the games... I'd recommend Zenobi to anyone." And I couldn't agree more. The reason I mention this is that Nicholas wrote to me a couple of years ago saying there was no future for the indie houses as he couldn't be bothered bunging a postal order into an envelope and he was sure most other people felt the same. (This is highly unfair of me... I just hope no one reminds me of what I might have said two years ago!) 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicholas also praises the Guiding Light telephone helpline, and I'm always glad to hear from people who have made use of various services like this. Do tell me what you think. Nicholas was playing <I>Jekyll And Hyde</I> one Saturday evening, felt quite pleased with himself for finishing part two, but couldn't start part three. Why? He didn't realise that a certain word quoted at the end of the second part is the password for starting the third part. A call to Guiding Light was the only way he could carry on his Saturday evening adventuring. "Well worth 50p for two minutes of grateful help," he says. So while he was on the line why didn't he ask them how to finish <I><a href="lizardking.htm">Bulbo And The Lizard King</a></I>, instead of pestering me? He says he's done the bit of thinking at the end and got rid of Stratos, but how do you actually end the game? Is it something to do with the hole? It certainly is. You must have tried to EXAMINE HOLE, in which case all that's left to do is DNAH TRESNI. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Gareth Pitchford</b> hasn't quite got that far, as he wants to know the previous bit, how to defeat Stratos. Something to do with thinking, he thinks. He thinks right! Or rather he doesn't, as he's tried thinking of everything he can... er, think of, but Stratos keeps bringing out his skeletons and winning. (The blighter!) What you have to do is first ETAH KNIHT and then NOGARD KNIHT. Then see the previous paragraph! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gareth's also struggling in <I>Apache Gold</I>. Where's the rope? ENOTSBMOT EHT TA ESOON EHT S'TI. What to do with the tomahawk? Two uses - SUTCAC DNA HCNARB. How to get the manure? NREF DEEF. And, being the generous gent he is, Gareth offers help to other readers on the games he has solved, which are <I><a href="30games.htm">Escape</a>, Forest At World's End, <a href="tolkientrilogy.htm">The Hobbit</a>, Karyssia, <a href="lordoftherings.htm">Lord Of The Rings</a>, Mountains Of Ket, <a href="thepawn.htm">The Pawn</a>, Quest For The Golden Eggcup, <a href="sixinone.htm">Red Door</a>, Warlord</I> and <I><a href="winterwonderland.htm">Winter Wonderland</a></I>. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>John Bond</b> (I know his brother, Premium) wrote to me twice from Stubbington in Hants but forgot his sae, so here's his reply. Oh no, it's that wretched Bulbo again. I'll have to print a full solution to this one, I can see. John complains that the trolls keep sending him back to the start of the game after he's pinched the spade from them. Don't complain, as that's what's meant to happen! It saves you tramping all the way back yourself at this point, which is the next thing you need to do. In <I>Behind Closed Doors The Sequel</I>, forget about the grease on the drainpipe. In <I><a href="thehermitage.htm">The Hermitage</a></I>, John wonders where the money is for the man on the rope- bridge. First you have to save the body from the burning hut. I guess the reason you can't do this is that you've gone and thrown the water at the vampire, which is one of your tips for this game. Instead you should use the water to TEKNALB TEW. To get rid of the vampiress - XIFICURC WORHT. Thanks for allowing me that last little bit of backwards writing, John, and now I can stroll off into the sunset for another month. (Sings - <I>I'm walking backwards to Christmas, across the Irish Sea...</I>)
