<p> <font size=4><b> *&$@*@& +2As</b></font><br> *&$@*@& +2As! <i>(Steady on now. Ed)</i> Yes. Believe it or not I'm peeved off with my +2A. It's like this. A couple of weeks ago my cousin's 48K Speccy finally snuffed it, and, being the kind soul that he is, he gave me his games - all old games from the pre +2 period. When I tried these games out some of them worked but were total crap, so I decided to try the non-working ones out on my friend's normal +2. And guess what? They worked, and were PDG. <i>Cyclone</i>, <i><a href="bombjack.htm">Bombjack</a></i> and <i>Frank Bruno's Boxing</i> were absolutely brilliant. It's really getting to me that I can't play these games on my own computer. Also the crappy joystick, the SJ51, is useless. It's as stiff as a Skoda's steering and there's no autofire on it. I can't help thinking that I made the worst investment of my life by buying this computer. I'm seriously thinking of feeding it to my neighbours' rottweiler. <br> <b> Ray Irwin <br> Co Tyrone, N Ireland <br> </b> PS The mag is great. It's the only thing keeping me sane at the moment. <br> <br><i> What a rascal that Alan Sugar is, eh? The +2A is all his fault, you know - quantity at the expense of quality seems to be his motto. In fact, I think I'll phone him up right now and tell him what, er, you think of him. (Dialling noises ) "Hello, can I speak to Alan Sugar please, I want to give a 'a piece of someone else's mind'." (Long pause.) "Oh. Bye." (Sound of receiver being replaced.) Um, he wasn't in, and I've been told never ever to phone back. Sorry. <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> HELLO, IS ANYBODY THERE?</b></font><br> Not having seen a copy of your mag in the local newsagent lately (the last one was May 1988) I got to wondering... 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) Are you guys still alive? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) How do you go about getting a subscription if no one down here stocks the mag? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) Do you know of anyone down here that sells Spectrum gear? If you could find some way of getting this material, info, or whatever to me I would be much obliged. <br> <b> Arthur Wall <br> Mosman Park, Australia <br> </b> <br><i> 1) Some say yes, some say no. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) I'll send you the details. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) In Australia? You should be so lucky (lucky, lucky, lucky...) <b>Ed.</b> 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shut up! <b>T'zer.</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> A POEM...</b></font><br> <i>Your Sinclair</i> is brilliant, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Your Sinclair</i> is ace. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time I read it, it puts 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A smile on my face. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It helps me with my problems, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It gives me lots of tips, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I especially like to read it 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I'm eating chips. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's Matt and Marcus and Kat. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's Duncan and David and Rob. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you ever stopped publishing 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would make me go sob sob. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's such a brilliant mag, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's the ultimate Spectrum tool, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess what I'm trying to say is 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Your Sinclair</i> is cool! <br> <b> Ben Morgan <br> Hemyock, Devon <br> </b> PS I'm a subscriber. (Hint hint.) <br> <br><i> Poems are like buses. I hadn't received any for absolutely ages when suddenly about eight million turned up at the same time. Your first verse is okay, but the second is a bit iffy - couldn't you have thought of something better than 'chips' to rhyme with 'tips'? "I especially like to read it, When I'm eating chips." Crikey. That's terrible. Verse three's a bit crap as well - in fact, it's extremely crap. But then, as if by magic, things pick up again verse four is as good as verse one. (Mind you, in retrospect, verse one was actually rather useless as well) I'll give you a C minus. <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> ANOTHER ONE</b></font><br> There once was a mag called <i>YS</i>, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the world it tried to impress, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It hit SU for six 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;('Cos Matt drew the chicks), 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now all agree <i>YS</i> is best! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It gives you a Smash Tape each time, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which is crammed full of games sublime, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inside there's trills of reviews, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what's what and also who's who. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With millions of prizes, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who call them misers, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah yes, <i>YS</i> is best for you. <br> <b> Philip Smith <br> Bridge of Don, Aberdeen <br> </b> <br><i> I like your first verse. I like it a lot. It has an element of 'realism' to it that really lights my candle. I was particularly impressed with the fourth line because, well, I am rather 'fetching' really. I'd almost say 'well done', but unfortunately there's the matter of your second verse to take into consideration. It doesn't exactly 'flow', does it? I'm afraid you're going to have to take a D. No, hang on, I think I'll make that a D minus because of the line that goes "Which is crammed full of games sublime'. <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> AND ANOTHER</b></font><br> <i>YS</i> is best, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It beats the rest, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's as cool 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a freezing swimming pool. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reviews are very good, They don't tell you fairy tales like 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Riding Hood. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some bits are a bit novel, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for the Star Letter I grovel. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beg, beg, grovel, grovel, praise, grovel, worship, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll go into a sulk if you don't. <br> <b> William Andrews <br> Wimblington, Cambs <br> </b> <br><i> Oh dear. Um, I like the 'free form' bit at the end, where you don't even bother trying to rhyme things, but, er, I'm not exactly 100% sure about the rest of it. Oh, go on, take a B minus for the grovelling bits - but only if you promise never to write a poem again. <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <TABLE align=center BORDER BGCOLOR=white BACKGROUND=""><TR><TD> <FONT SIZE=6><B><U>STAR LETTER</U></b></font><br><font size=4><b> A <i><a href="neighbours.htm">NEIGHBOURS</a></i> EXPERT WRITES</b></font><br> I've just finished reading a letter in the August issue of <i>YS</i> (yes, I know it was out months ago, but I only just got it). It was from Tim the Tasmanan, complaining about the lack of software in Australia. It's a problem here for sure, but complaining about it doesn't help much. Unfortunately, owning a Speccy in Australia is like owning waterskis on Mars. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being a programmer of sorts, I find it disappointing that the technical content of <i>YS</i> has decreased much since the old days of the Spectrum. Doesn't anyone in your office know how to program? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keeping up the tradition of all aspiring Trainspotters I must point out one of the mistakes in the August issue. I refer to the beach 'fact' telling the tale of the South Aussie sandcastle maker who lost his masterpiece due to a hurricane. So what? What was so special about Norm's efforts after all? Everyone makes sandcastles, don't they? (I once made one that was so big I had to build it in the middle of the desert because there wasn't enough sand at the beach.) Anyway, it was a phenomenal piece of bad luck Norm had with his castle getting wiped out by a hurricane, especially when you consider that Australia doesn't get hurricanes. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you want to know what's going on in <i><a href="neighbours.htm">Neighbours</a></i> over here? <i>(Yes yes yes. Ed)</i> Well, as of last Friday, Nick (who you probably don't know yet) <i>(Yes we do. Ed)</i> was acting really aggro because he got meningitis due to a skull fracture that nobody knew about. Des went to England (seen him at all?) <i>(Yes. Ed)</i> to marry Jane who is looking after her grandmother who has nearly carked it. Gail had triplets but ran away to Tasmania because she claimed that Paul didn't care about anything other than his business. <i>(But he doesn't. Ed)</i> This fit of emotion was sparked off by the fact that Rob Lewis (Gail's dad) kicked the proverbial after a car crash which was indirectly due to Paul calling Rob a thief (which he was) <i>(I can believe that. Ed)</i>. Henry is also getting married - to Bronwyn. And that's about all I'm going to say about <i><a href="neighbours.htm">Neighbours</a></i>, due to the fact that it's a pretty pathetic TV show. By the way, Scott and Charlene got the boot ages ago (they 'moved' to Brisbane). <i>(No they didn't. They 'moved' to England, after signing up with Stock, Aitken and Waterman. Ed)</i> <br> <b> C J Gorle <br> N Rockhampton, <br> Queensland, <br> Australia <br> </b> <br><i> For someone who thinks </i><a href="neighbours.htm">Neighbours</a><i> is so pathetic, you certainly seem to know the current Australian plotline pretty well. So Henry's going to marry Bronwyn, eh? Actually, I already guessed he was going to - but I didn't think it would take that long to happen - I thought Henry was a faster mover than that. And Gall has triplets, eh? Well I never. <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> </td></tr></table><p> <TABLE align=center BORDER BGCOLOR="#208020" BACKGROUND=""><TR><TD><center><font size=6><b>THE WONDERFUL WORLD OF SPECCY</b></font></center><p> <b>Every month we get mail from around the world.

(Oh, and one from Poland.)</b> <p> <font size=4><b> FROM A DIFFERENT PLANET</b></font><br> I was asked my opinion of your magazine from a graphically pleasing point of view a few months ago, to which my response was not too favourable. Having been shown your excessive colour co-ordinations, or should I say combinations, many times since, I feel I must write to express my aversions to your use of background textures. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair enough that many of your readers probably like or need bright colours, but even they must feel that the imagery is somewhat oppressive. In issue 42 the primary red dots on the primary yellow background are executed in a rather 'op art' manner and are visually and psychologically very disturbing indeed. <br> <b> Florence Hughes <br> Hove, East Sussex <br> </b> <br><i> Blimey.

'well done'!!! <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> </td></tr></table><p> <font size=4><b> TWO POLES</b></font><br> I am sorry for taking up your time, but I believe you can listen to me. My name is Marek and I am bonking as an electro-mechanical engineer. I am interested in a lot of things, but one of my interests attracts myself more than the others. It is computer technology. My adventure with computer begins about two year ago, when I visit my friend who bought Commodore 64. Ten first days were terrible. C64 was our meat, air, dreams, days and nights. Over and over. <i>(Blimey. Ed)</i> At last we felt ill seriously. <i>(Not surprised. Ed)</i> You can imagine yourselves what our wives said about it. As I do not have any computer yet (it's too expensive now for me) I still visit my friend. But now we spend only a few hours at our computer work and computer pastime. We are interested in graphic, music and education programs. Sometimes we are Adventure and Simulation games. We collect materials about news and novelty of computer hardware and software. We enjoy working with C64. It is helping me learn English all the time. (Better later than never.) I hope you do not mind my asking you if you can send me a number of your magazine. It could be very useful for getting information about our computer, his software, equipment and people who loved this computer like we. You have not any guarantee that we will pay for it. We do not promise to subscribe to your magazine either. But we would be happy to get it for free. We hope this does not inconvenience you in any way. If it does please say it to us. <br> <b> Marek and Richard <br> Deblinz, Poland <br> </b> <br><i> It. <b>Ed.</b> 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't be facetious. <b>T'zer.</b> 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorry. Um, I'll send you an issue - but, frankly, I don't think it'll be much help to you. <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> WNDMILLS AND TULIPS</b></font><br> Picture this. A low-on-cash student enters a bookshop. He takes his favourite Speccy mag off of the stand and reads the cover. "<i>Wonderboy</i>... complete full price game... <i>Heroes Of Karn</i>... double decker issue... Might as well spend my last money on this," he murmers. He battles his way up to the counter and hands 8.25 guilders over to the nice lady. After this he asks her if he can have his tapes. "No," she replies. "Read this line." And there it is, hiding at the bottom - 'Smash Tapes only available in the UK.' Oh dear... 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you might have guessed by now, that student was me! At home I decided to draw up a plan to undo this great injustice. The plans ranged from kidnapping the Ed (won't work, I'd end up with the Ed and &pound;1,000,000 paid to me to keep him) to bombing Rathbone Place with clogs, with the most sadistic one being making you clogdance for a whole hour. Then it came to my mind that you are all reasonable people (Spectrum owners are per definition reasonable people), and I decided to type you this letter. So stop discriminating Cloglanders (and any other non-Britons), and give us our Smash Tapes back. May the Smash Tapes be with me. <br> <b> Pascal van den Berg <br> Delft, Holland <br> </b> <br><i> You don't say 'stop discriminating Cloglanders' - you say 'stop discriminating </i>against<i> Cloglanders'. Anyway, what's the problem! It's not as if England's a million miles away from Holland, is it? You could easily hop on a boat once a month and buy your copy of </i>YS<i> (with tape attached) over here. And you don't even have to pay for the passage either - you could offer to swab the decks instead. You Cloglanders always make such a song and dance about everything, even when the solution is totally obvious. <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> INHERITANCE</b></font><br> I thought you might be interested to know that I've just 'inherited' every issue of <i>YS</i> from number three to the present day. Now that I've got that bit of 'showing off' out of the way I can write about what I wrote in to write about. <i>(You what! Ed)</i>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) Why doesn't Robin 'Honest Rob' Alway sell some of his Alway-patented Instant Growth Syrup to Jackie Ryan? (I probably won't get my letter printed now.)

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) Why are all your, erm, 'boobies' in the magazine? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4) Why is <i>YS</i> such excellent value for money (grovel, slurp)? <br> <b> Martyn 'The Master' Bader <br> Wallsend, Tyne and Wear <br> </b> <br><i> 1) He has sold her some.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) She's, erm, Kati Hamza. And she's got a bad case of Athlete's Foot. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) I've never shown my 'boobies' in the magazine. What are you talking about?

Madame Pico should have returned from holiday by now, but, rather mysteriously, she hasn't! Erm, so here's another instalment of... BUD PICO'S HOW TO DO IT!</b> 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Dear How To Do It, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My wife and I live in a very old cottage and we encounter tremendous problems during the winter months. You see, no matter how high we set our thermostat we just don't seem to be able to keep the house warm. Am I correct in assuming that effective insulation would solve this problem? Is it expensive? Please tell me, How To Do It. <br>Mr A Sutton <br>Shropshire <br><i>Yes, effective insulation would be a major help to keeping in heat. It would also reduce your bills. Another way to save money would be to use my 'do it yourself insulation tips'. Pop down to your local supermarket and invest in several packets of Kellogs Rice Krispies. Then go into your loft and sprinkle them liberally between the rafters. This is also a good opportunity to see if there are any holes in the roof that need attention. Small holes could be 'stopped' using old pairs of socks - but I recommend placing them in a polythene hag first so as to ensure water resistance. It's also an idea for you to, what we in the trade call, 'lag' your hot water tank. Sellotape two large bin bags together so that they can surround the tank and leave a gap of about one and a half inches all around it. Fill this gap with Kellogs Rice Krispies and hey presto!
