<b> First I'm forced out of the Letters page and find that She Who Must Be Obeyed has ensconced herself for a month. And now she's taken over the rest of the mag and I've been given some fancy title and chucked upstairs. Well, you don't get rid of me that easily. I may be the Ex Ed and T'zer's taken over but I'm not giving up Letters this month... </b> <p> <font size=4><b> THOR OUT</b></font><br> 7 o'clock tonight then T'zer? Oh! Sorry... 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear <i>YS</i>, on your December ish, the pic on the front cover (I used it for a poster) caught my eye. The two warriors Thor and Sheba from the new game <i><a href="dandy.htm">Dandy</a></i> were wearing some very funny things. I would've thought that they're too old for 'early learning' face paints. (Don't worry mums, it comes off the carpets!). Thor had a Sony Walkman strapped to him and must've got his C&A trousers at half price. As for Sheba's frock... well! Keep up the pics! They make great pin-ups! <br> <b> Robin Maunder <br> Lancaster <br> </b> <br><i> Of course, they make great pin-ups. Look who did the modelling... </i><p> Was it really necessary to portray the Ed and T'zer scantily clad on the cover of the December issue? After all, you do have young readers and my mummy says it's a bad influence! <br> <b> Michael White <br> Hexham, <br> Northumberland <br> </b> <br><i> There you go, I've always said we were influential people. Bad but influential! <b>Ex Ed</b> </i><p> I have a complaint about your (so called) mega brill mag. It's the cover design. How do you think it looks, me a mature 13 year old, walking out of John Menzies with what looks like a comic under my arm. Well, I tell you, I get laughed at by people in the street. <br> <b> Scott McKellar <br> Port Glasgow, <br> Renfrewshire <br> </b> <br><i> So, you get laughed at in the street, do you? But what's that got to do with </i>YS<i>? And don't tell me you only get laughed at when you're carrying it 'cos that one won't wash. <b>Ex Ed</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> RSVP</b></font><br> Dear T'zer, I saw your picture in the December issue of <i>YS</i> and thought I'd write to you. I also saw the star letter. I have written in to some companies and here's what happened. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 Firebird - five posters and a new price list. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 Gremlin Graphics - no posters and a price list. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 Mirrorsoft- five posters, catalogue and price list. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4 Melbourne House - three posters and a price list. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5 Hewson - no posters and a price list. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6 Electric Dreams - two posters (both <i><a href="backtothefuture.htm">Back To The Future</a></i>) and more of a fact sheet than a price list. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7 Ocean - five posters and a price list. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8 <i>Your Sinclair</i> - (hopefully) a picture of T'zer! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And why is the pic of T'zer in the December ish a bigger shot of her head from the May issue. Can we have some new pictures of T'zer? <br> <b> Matthew Landor <br> Gaspart, Hants <br> </b> <br><i> Now T'zer's the Ed, I'm worried that we won't have anything but pics of her in the mag from now on... </i><p> I am writing to redress the balance of the software firms that Mr McSherry had problems with. I wrote to the following software companies asking them two questions. 1. Do you have posters and if so, how much are they? 2. Do you do 128K upgrades of your programs? I got the following results: 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hewson - six days, four posters, yes to upgrades 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mikro-Gen - No reply 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mastertronic - 13 days, yes to posters, no to upgrades 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimate - nine days, three posters, no upgrades 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;US Gold - No reply 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melbourne House - 22 days, no posters, no upgrades 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elite - 26 days, only replied after I bought some games. Three posters sent. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firebird - 17 days, yes to posters, yes to free upgrades 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine - 12 days, yes to posters, no to upgrades 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ocean - 13 days, no to posters, no to upgrades 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Software Projects - four days, four posters sent, no to upgrades 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CRL - No reply 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PSS - six days, two posters sent, no upgrades 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Design Design - 14 days, three posters, no upgrades 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Elite does reply to queries but you have to buy its games first! Could I also add that Hewson, Firebird, Design Design, Software Projects, Melbourne House and Mikro-Gen have been extremely helpful with other queries. US Gold's PR department wants shooting! <br> <b> Jon Rose <br> Bognor Regis, W Sussex <br> </b> PS Mike Gerrard took only six days to reply - thanks a lot Mike! <br> <br><i> We've had loads of letters detailing your experiences of writing to software houses and no two are the same. A few companies come out consistently well and some seem consistently bad - they know who they are! But remember that most companies are quite small and spend most of their time just trying to get out games they started advertising six months ago, so do try to be patient. <b>Ex Ed </b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> ALAS SMITH...</b></font><br> In the December issue of <i>YS</i>, Rachael Smith reviewed <i>Druid</i>. For her benefit and any other <i>Druid</i> owners, it is possible for another player to control Golem. Choose the type of joystick you want to control Golem with, start the game, press H, toggle the P key until the screen displays 'joystick' and press H again. Once you've invoked Golem, player 2 can now control him. My best personal rating so far is Love Seeker but with my friend Chris Hubbard who controls Golem we have destroyed two skulls and attained Cleric. <br> <b> Martin Wilson <br> Leeds <br> </b> <br><i> By a strange coincidence, Rachael's best personal rating is Love Seeker too - if only she'd use her talents in </i>Druid<i> rather than practising them on Gwyn! <b>Ex Ed</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> UM... AR...</b></font><br> A few months ago now, when I read your review of <i><a href="tasword3.htm">Tasword 3</a></i>, I was most upset. Why? Because you regarded some of the foreign characters as "funny" and called them "dingbats" (whatever they are!) <i>(You use them to hit dingballs! Ex Ed)</i>. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These "funny characters" just happen to be the pride of our language. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the other characters are the pride of some other language. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also get very angry when you don't print the <i>[Funny characters - NickH (who can't be bothered to look up the HTML codes for them...)]</i> in someone's name (yes, I know you do it sometimes). It really hurts my feelings as a Swedish citizen. <br> <b> Roger "Katal" Lindberg <br> Uddvella, Sweden <br> </b> PS It really sounds funny when an Englishman tries to pronounce <i>[More of 'em - NickH]</i>. <br> <br><i> Er.. .ah. ..oooooh! It's true. All your little foreign fiddly bits keep dropping off but we'll be more careful in future. Hurdie hurdie ho! <b>Ex Editor</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> MARCO GOES SOLO</b></font><br> I really like <i>We've Got a Spectrum</i> in the December issue of <i>YS</i>! Okay, I really like everything else in <i>YS</i>, apart from T'zer's interruptions in the Letters, <i>(That makes two of us! Ex Ed)</i> but this one was a very good article. Mmmm...Ram Music Machine... I'll buy one! Mmmm... Dataskip Video Digitizer... I'll get one! Mmmm... CZ-1017 I'll... er, I already own one! (I think I'll take another.) You know, <i>(No, I don't. Ex Ed)</i> I was once a professional musician and hobbyist programmer. I was the singer in a not-so-well-known-but-quite-well-paid dance group. We played the sort of songs you hear on the radio - Michael Jackson, Scritti Politti, Madonna, Peter Gabriel, that sort of thing. <i>(You mean they paid you to stop! Ex Ed)</i>. And I used my Spectrum on stage to drive all the keyboards, sequencers, drums and so on. Or at any rate, the audience was expected to believe this. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now my question: will I be able to drive my Simmons drum kit with the Ram Music Machine? And will I be able to trig the Ram Music Machine with my Simmons? Any clue about this? (Better you do have, or I'll never trust a <i>YS</i> Make-It-Big Special for the rest of my life!) <br> <b> Marco Fasola <br> Crocifisso Di Savosa, <br> Switzerland <br> </b> <br><i> Are you suggesting we might be clueless at </i>YS<i> ? Well that's all right then. The answer to both your questions is yes. The Ram Music Machine is fully MIDI compatible. You can even trigger two sounds at once via the Ram which you can't do using the keyboard. And how do I, the man with two tin ears who thought that a Simmons was a type of gazelle, know all this? Phil's just told me, that's how. <b>Ex Ed</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> GAZ BORED</b></font><br> Please give me your verdict. I've just seen an ad for Elite's new compilation tape called <i>Hit-Pak</i> and I was shocked. The games that feature are <i>Airwolf, Frank Bruno, <a href="commando.htm">Commando</a></i> and <i><a href="bombjack.htm">Bombjack</a></i>. I was disgusted. I think it's appalling that less than six months ago, the latter two were selling for &pound;7.95 each. So, if you total up, it comes to &pound;15.90. So, I spent the &pound;15.90 on those two brill games and then I find out that they are being flogged for &pound;9.95 plus two other games. I feel ripped off. It wouldn't affect people who've got either one or none of the games, but I think differently. What d'you think? <br> <b> Gaz Davenport <br> Cranleigh, Surrey <br> </b> <br><i> I think you're wrong. Look at it this way. You brought the games at the time because they were new and exciting. You wanted to play them when all your friends were playing them - not a year, or even six months, later. It's the same with books. If you want to read something as soon as it's published you have to cough up the cash for the hardback. You could wait a year and it might, but only might, appear in paperback. If you don't want to gamble, you have to pay up. Compilations are great for people who weren't really tempted first time round but are willing to give a game a whirl when it's at cut-price. <b>Ex Ed</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> PRODIGAL SON</b></font><br> My mum has gone and bought me, dare I say it, a BBC Master computer with disk drive. What with having to type in *ADFS everytime you want to use a disk and Chain"?" whenever you want to load anything, I was quite happy at first. So happy in fact that I gave my 11 year old brother my Speccy, 100 odd games, light pens, joysticks, speech synthesisers, the works. I decided that I would betray <i>YS</i> and go for another mag for the Beeb. I went down to my local newsagent and looked at the mags for the Beeb. I then saw the price. 'Sugar' I said to myself. The mag was all adverts and info. Blah awful. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I saw <i>YS</i> and picked it up - a sight for sore eyes. I paid for it, left the shop, went home and told my brother to go away and use the Beeb. What a relief to be in control of my Speccy once again. Thank you. <br> <b> Howard Draper, Surrey <br> </b> <br><i> And the moral of this truly heartwarming story is - if your mother's got enough spare dosh to buy you a Beeb, send it to the Society for the Preservation of Redundant Editors, 14 Rathbone Place... before she has you joining the Chain "?" gang! <b>Ex Ed and President of the SPRE</b>. </i> <p> <TABLE align=center BORDER BGCOLOR=cyan BACKGROUND=""><TR><TD> <table align=left><tr><td align=center><IMG src="../thumbs/letters/trainspotter.jpg"><br><font size=5><B>TRAINSPOTTER<br>AWARD</b></font></td></tr></table><font size=4><b> BATTLE OF HASTINGS</b></font><br> <i><a href="uridium.htm">Uridium</a></i>, your <i>Frontlines</i> pic,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, you're a terrible poet and this month's trainspotter! <b>Ex Ed</b> </i> <p> </td></tr></table><p> <font size=4><b> TRENDSPOTTER</b></font><br> Wow! I have just experienced another <i>YS</i>. That picture of Caroline Clayton really blew my fuse. Wottasmasha! 'Ere what about some more piccies? How about coming up the rub-a-dub, Caroline? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway keep up the good work team. Laugh, I nearly sold my VIC-20. What a great mag - it's hard to believe it's about computers. <i>(No-one told me it was supposed to be about computers! Ex Ed. That's why you're the Ex Ed! T'zer)</i>. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh Ed, let's have some more machine code pages, I would gladly send in handy routines, tips and so on as my friend is trying to learn Z80. <i>(Send them in and we might. T'zer)</i> And another thing, not all programmers are long haired, spotty freaks. I've been programming for five years and I'm a trendy (I hope Caroline's reading this), unemployed 18 year old programmer. <br> <b> Kevan Thurstans <br> Mitcham, Surrey <br> </b> PS How old are you Caroline? Fancy a date? <br> <br><i> Caroline tells me that she's old enough to be your sister! And anyway she prefers figs to dates. <b>Ex Ed</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> OFF HIS NUT</b></font><br> Dear <i>YS</i> followers, nay beloved <i>YS</i> followers, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HELP! sorry, please HELP! (sob). I'm desperate, I'm foolhardy (sniff), I'm irrecoverable, irremediable, irretrievable, irrepressible, irrational, irritable, irr...irrun out of words beginning with irr... 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm afraid that I've gone crackers. I listen to Wham! records. I turned my treasured cut-out of Caroline towards the wall, would you believe it. You see I told you I'm insane. I even thought about swapping my Speccy for a... (excuse the language) Commodore. Yes, I know, I should be locked up. I even tried to end it all by watching... the Terry Wogan Show... <i>(You are sick! Ex Ed)</i>. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It all began on that terrible day when I had the misfortune to spot an adventure at the give-away price of &pound;1.99. This computer game has wrecked my life - forcing me to wear a brown paper bag over my head. It's not even as if I'm inexperienced. I've completed such brain bashers as <i>Tir Na Nag, <a href="ystop100_4.htm">Lords Of Midnight</a>, Shadowfire</i> and <i>Frankie Goes To Hollywouldn't</i>. But this...pardon? What's that? Oh, the name of the game? I dunno if I can say it ... it's ... <i>Sea Base Delta</i> from the zombie producers, Firebird. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I'm not alone in my world of misery - three of my mates have also failed to complete this game. We've tried everything. We made complex maps, we made a list of the vocabulary, we even resorted to cheating. Yep, we broke into the program but before we could find an end to our misery one of my mates came over all conscientious and cleared the memory. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe we're not meant to complete this game and it's our destiny to wear brown paper hats the rest of our days. <br> <b> Seamus "nuttier than <br> KP" Fitzsimons <br> Downpatrick, Co Down <br> </b> <br><i> I've just thought of another word beginning with irr. .. IRRIOT! Take the brown paper bag off your head, fashion it into an envelope and send it to Mike Gerrard. Meanwhile, take your shirt off, then put it on again with the buttons at the back and ask someone to tie the sleeves together.

But I felt cheated by the November game, re-called <i>Time Bomb</i> by Robert Burgess. In <i>Computer Gamer</i>, May 86 (I don't get it now, I hasten to add) I found the very same listing called <i>Time For Action</i>. As I typed this in at the time I've now got nothing to type in this month, so I've time to write. I wonder if this is the first time Mr Burgess has changed the name of the game and said it as a new game. I'll still stay with <i>Your Sinclair</i> but let's have new listings and not ones as old as me. I'm 36! <br> <b> Brian Dixon <br> Glenrothes, Scotland <br> </b> <br><i> You weren't the only one who felt cheated, Brian. I won't repeat what I said in last month's Letters but it's interesting that "Mr" Burgess pulled the same sting on </i>Computer Gamer<i>. Where will </i>Time For Action<i> turn up next? Outer Mongolia along with its programmer if I have my way. <b>Ex Ed</b> </i>
