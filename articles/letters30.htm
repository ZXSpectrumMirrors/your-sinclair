<p> <font size=4><b> HOVER BOVER</b></font><br> As the managing director of Gardensoft, I wish to complain about the unfair review of our recently released <i><a href="advancedlownmowersimulation.htm">Advanced Lawnmower Simulator</a></i>. It was nice of you to give the program a Megagame stamp, but I feel you made some serious omissions. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, there was no mention of the full colour A3 poster of a Qualcast Concord mower, free with every copy of the program on Plus 3 disk. Secondly, you did not inform your readers of the program's compatibility with the Interface Two, Currah Microspeech (Don't chop up the worms!!), and the Troian lightpen. I believe this is a deliberate attempt by larger software houses to put us out of business before we take over the entire market, by bribing magazines to gloss over the finer points of our products. For instance, the extensive advertising campaign we initiated has never been seen by the public. How do you expect us to sell games when you 'forget' to run our full-page colour advertisements for the game, featuring the lovely Rosie Bush, tastefully garbed in green bikini and wellies? I trust these shortcomings will not occur in the future when we unveil our next range of games, including <i>DIY Wallpaperer Simulator, Household Chores Compendium</i>, and the state-of-the-art <i>Boiled Egg Timer</i> strategy/adventure concept game, available in the summer exclusively for the new Spectrum +4, with built-in Laserdisk RAM storage. <br> <b> G Miller <br> Gardensoft Publishing <br> Empire plc <br> Dover, Kent. <br> </b> <br><i> We certainly could never accuse you of letting the grass grow under your feet, what with all these new products coming out. I'm sorry if you found our review to be a thorn in your side, we thought it was a cut above average. Still at least we've printed your letter, which should help you regain your composture. Not only that, here's a picture of that mower that's a lot less bovver than a hover that you've been crocusing about! <b>Ed</b> <p><center><a href="../thumbs/letters/big/30a.jpg"><IMG SRC="../thumbs/letters/30a.jpg"></a></center><p> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> PAYNEFUL</b></font><br> I recently bought a rival mag for the 'free' game tape on the cover, to see how it would compare with your games. After reading through the mag, I have come to the conclusion that <i>YS</i> caters for readers of higher intelligence (I mean, who wants a letters page run by a rabid, psychopathic teddy? T'zer is bad enough!!). This other mag seems to think its tape is better than everyone else's, having a game on one side and a playable demo (gasp, gasp), on the other. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore suggest that your next cover tape be something a little more upmarket and technical like a graphics utility or an adventure creator (mini-<i>PAW</i> or <i>GAC</i>?). 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changing the subject slightly, I have every issue of <i>Your Spectrum</i>/<i>Your Sinclair</i> and while I find that the mag has improved tremendously over the years, I think you concentrate too much on games, and not enough on utilities and peripherals (only one Hardware/Hard Facts special since July '87). 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, enough griping - thanks for a great magazine. But please take note of my ramblings - some of us don't play games all of the time!! <br> <b> Martin Payne <br> Portsmouth, Hants. <br> </b> PS I like orange Smarties and milk chocolate M&amp;Ms. <br> <br><i> You should be well-pleased 'cos we've recently started a page every month called </i>Rage Hard<i> which is solely on hardware peripherals. What do you think? <b>Ed</b>. </i> <p> <font size=4><b> MEGAGAMES</b></font><br> I have written this letter in praise of the excellent quality of your free games. I read all the Spectrum mags, <i>Crash, Sinclair User</i> and <i>Your Sinclair</i>. They have all had games on the cover. <i>Crash</i> had playable demos, <i>YS</i> had proper games and <i>Sinclair User</i> copied games. They gave a copy of a game called <i>Zarjaz</i> which is a scrolling shoot 'em up. The thing is, that if you have played <i><a href="zub.htm">Zub</a></i> and then pressed 2,4,6 and 8, you get a game called <i>Lightfarce</i>. <i>Zarjaz</i> was an exact copy of the game, apart from the title. It makes me so mad that they should charge an extra 50p for a game everyone has got or played. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you again for your high standard of games. <br> <b> Daniel Nugent <br> Hanworth, Middx. <br> </b> <br><i> Well, you'll already have played </i><a href="blindpanic.htm">Blind Panic</a><i> by now which we reckon is another spanking game. What do you think of this month's game </i>People From Sirius<i>? I personally think it's pretty damn good. Why not write in and let us know? Unless of course you don't like it, in which case don't. <b>Ed</b> </i> <p> <TABLE align=center BORDER BGCOLOR="#208020" BACKGROUND=""><TR><TD><center><font size=6><b>THE WONDERFUL WORLD OF SPECCY</b></font></center><p> <b>Yes, every month we invite readers from overseas to write in and tell us about the wide world of Speccy playing.

Failing that you can always ask your local MP. <b>Ed</b> </i> <p> </td></tr></table><p> <font size=4><b> LIKE A VIRGIN...</b></font><br> I was very interested in reading the article about role-playing games in the February issue of <i>YS</i>. I noticed at the bottom (fnar), you thanked Virgin Games Centre for the info. Could you print the address for Virgin Games as I (and many others) would like to send away for some. <br> <b> Allen Baird <br> Londonderry, N. Ireland. <br> </b> <br><i> Contact Virgin Megamail (the mail order branch) at </i>[Snipped - NickH]<i> and they'll send you a catalogue. <b>Ed</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> CLOSE ENCOUNTER</b></font><br> Please tell me, are you human? There is no human on Earth that could write a magazine with the same instant appeal, quality and style that makes me go all... ooh... just by looking at it. <i>(Eh? Ed)</i> I for one, trust every single one of your reviewers and recently burnt down my local computer store because it didn't stock <i><a href="720degrees.htm">720 degrees</a></i>, which you rated as a megagame. <br> <b> Owen Billcliffe <br> Parkhurst, Isle of Wight. <br> </b> <br><i> No, I'm an alien. <b>Ed</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> ELECTRIC SHOCK!</b></font><br> I have a comment to make about <i>Desert Island Disks</i>. If stranded on a desert island with only your trusty Speccy, TV, tape recorder and eight fave games for company, where pray tell, would you find three plug sockets? On a nearby palm tree perhaps? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also on page 40 of the March issue of your mag there is a Castle Computers advert and down the bottom on the left it says, "Doc The Destroyer RRP 75p Our Price &pound;2.99." What a brilliant deal. <br> <b> Simon Warner <br> King's Lynn, Norfolk. <br> </b> <br><i> Are you a complete aardvark or something? All you need to do is take some re-chargeable batteries and a battery recharger. See! <b>Ed</b> </i> <p> <TABLE align=center BORDER BGCOLOR=white BACKGROUND=""><TR><TD> <FONT SIZE=6><B><U>STAR LETTER</U></b></font><br><font size=4><b> IN TUNE</b></font><br> Your magazine has just about everything it needs - a good logo, a programming section, plenty of reviews and a letters page (or two). But there is one thing missing, and that's a title tune. You can't expect to compete with <i>Crossroads</i> or <i>Eastenders</i> without a title tune, so to make amends for this I have just spent. Some time (about two minutes), composing one for you. Just type it into any Speccy and away you go. <p><center><a href="../thumbs/letters/big/30b.jpg"><IMG SRC="../thumbs/letters/30b.jpg"></a></center><p> <br> <b> David Smith <br> Belmont, Durham. <br> </b> PS What does the J stand for in Rachael J Smith? <br> PPS Have you noticed that for the last year <i>YS</i> is getting around two pages thinner every issue? Is it on a diet? <br> <br><i> Hang on a mo! That little ditty sounds a smidge like the </i><a href="neighbours.htm">Neighbours</a><i> theme tune to me. I reckon this little melody I composed earlier is much better. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Di di di dee dee

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dumdum dum dah 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ooooooh la la!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you think? <b>Ed</b> 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PS J stands for just. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PPS Its thicker you clot, but obviously not quite as thick as you! </i> <p> </td></tr></table><p> <font size=4><b> HEY JIMMY!</b></font><br> While hunting through all my. Old issues of <i>YS</i> (looking for hints on old games), I noticed that nearly all the adverts for games had one of two things on them -either, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) a rather spectacular woman's body (fnar), or 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) an act of unimaginable cruelty or violence. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interesting, eh? <br> <b> James Hughes <br> Stocksfield, <br> Northumberland. <br> </b> PS If all you people in the south think all us in the north are thick, then why have we got Europe's biggest shopping centre? <br> <br><i> Quite an achievement, I'm sure you'll agree. Any more comments on the north/south divide? <b>Ed</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> R.I.P.</b></font><br> It is with deepest regret that I bring this news to you, but last night the joke "my spaceship is parked at a parking meteor" (last printed in my letter, Feb ish), passed away peacefully in its sleep. I realise that this may come as a shock to a great many of you - but let's face it, it was ancient and unfunny. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a brighter note - hey T'zer, you know that piccy of you at the start of the letters pages... well what is that massive black zit on your face? And what does the pencil taste like? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, I enclose &pound;19, valid at the bank of Toytown - that should give me the Star Letter. <br> <b> Noddy <br> Dollar, Clacks. <br> </b> <br><i> It's a sad day when an old joke is finally laid to rest in Bob Monkhouse's Rest Home For Elderly Gags And Ancient Jests, but I'm afraid it happens to all of us at one time or another. I too recently lost a faithful, depended upon old joke a few months ago. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why has Dumbo got Big Ears? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Cos Noddy won't pay the ransom! <b>Ed</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> HUNKY DORY</b></font><br> I would like to point out the severe sexual discrimination in your publication. How many times have we seen pictures of the <i>YS</i> 'hunks' (I've seen better hunk's in a tin of Fray Bentos), <i>(I'm inclined to agree with you. Ed)</i>, for the 'adoring' women readership? But when one of us males asks for a little piccie of yourself, Rachael Smith or another of the female production team, what do we get? Nothing!! (except a load of excuses that wouldn't even fool an English teacher.) So please, let's have a few pictures of you lot (and from the list on page 92, there seems to be quite a lot of you), maybe even a pullout poster? <br> <b> Mark Owen <br> Ffestiniog, Gwynedd. <br> </b> <br><i> I posed for the cover photo last month, what more do you want? And don't let that lot on page 92 fool you. Most of those people are friends of the plumber who'll do anything to see their name in print. Anyway here's a pic of the Three Centigrades to keep you happy! But not too happy, mind. <b>Ed</b> <p><center><a href="../thumbs/letters/big/30c.jpg"><IMG SRC="../thumbs/letters/30c.jpg"></a></center><p> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> TROUBLE IN FIFE</b></font><br> <i>Frontlines</i> is good, <i>Future Shocks</i> is good, reviews are excellent. But (and this is a big BUT - see!), why do you always assume that your readership consists only of the under-16s? I am nearly 30! I thoroughly enjoy your mag, from cover to cover (and inside too!). 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please, please, PLEASE remember us older types (over 20, under a ton), who enjoy your humorous mag. Neglect us again and I'll tell my mum!! Sob!! <br> <b> A T Green <br> Glenrothes, Fife. <br> </b> <br><i> I'm sorry if you feel neglected We do try to aim the magazine at all ages, but the majority of our readers are around 16, and I don't think free bottles of hair restorer on the cover would go down very well with most of them.

I asked for a picture of Phil South (worrahunk), and all you printed was a photo of a teddy bear. I mean, you printed a picture of that gross Darrell for Claire Terry. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, here are a few questions for Phil. How old is he? Does he like the Pet Shop Boys? Do his socks smell as bad as my brother's? What does he do in his spare time? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this time print a piccy of him. And Claire Terry, he ain't too ugly to be anyone's idol, so bleughh to you.

As Keats once said, "If one has no heart, one cannot write for the masses." 
<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><i><a href="throughthetrapdoor.htm">Through The Trap Door</a></i>/Piranha </b><br> A great sequel to <i><a href="trapdoor.htm">Trap Door</a></i> based on the hilarious children's TV series. I just lurve the large detailed graphics, like Berk's eyes spinning when he falls. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><i><a href="batty.htm">Batty</a></i>/Elite </b><br> Best thing since battered fish. Worra game. This keeps me going for hours, even though I'm useless at it. Promoted by a superb magazine (grovel, grovel). 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><i><a href="outrun.htm">OutRun</a></i>/US Gold </b><br> Broom, broom, vroooomm! Belting along in my Ferrari with the wind blowing through my fur, watching the scenery fly by. This game is brill, a superb conversion from the arcade game. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that's it from <i>Desert Island Disks</i>. Next month we'll be publishing the final Diskers chart, with the all-time faves of everyone who's ever written in to the column.
