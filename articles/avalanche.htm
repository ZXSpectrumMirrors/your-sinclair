<div><b>Hmm. <i>Avalanche</i>. Sounds like 
this game should be set in 
Switzerland or somewhere, 
doesn't it? Fine, but there's 
one small problem with this - 
Switzerland doesn't have wars. They're 
famous for never, ever having wars, or 
even noisy arguments for that matter. </b>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll put you out of your misery. Avalanche is the 
name of a World War II operation by the Allies (that's 
us) to get the Germans (that's the Germans) out of 
Italy.

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The game starts with the Salerno landings in 
1943. Basically, thousands of Allies appeared on 
the beaches and fought their way towards Rome. 
So the game ends with either the capture of Rome 
by your bods or the real end of the war in 1945. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You take turns with either a mate or the computer, and the idea is to plan what you want to do 
with your troops while he's moving his, then move 
yours while he's planning. Easy peasy, eh? Well, 
shifting divisions of tanks around <i>is</i> pretty easy 
actually. All you need to do is select your troops 
using the flashing cursor, then move them to the 
correct area. They remember where they're going, 
even if it takes more than one turn, so it's all 
pretty quick. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b><i>Is it like any other 
wargame?</i></b><br>
Funny you should say that, because it's a fair bit 
like <i><a href="battleofthebulge.htm">Battle Of The Bulge</a></i>, which was also by CCS. 
In fact, it's the same game system, so it looks 
very similar apart from the fact that it's got different place names. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this isn't really important, because the 
whole strategy of <i>Avalanche</i> is different from 
any other CCS game. It's set on a peninsula 
somewhere in Italy so there's loads of water 
around. This means that you can't run away 
from the enemy in any direction, unless you 
actually want your divisions to perish in the 
Mediterranean. So it's all down to strategy and 
tactics. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Y'see, the whole thing's got immense historical relevance. The real event happened 
pretty much as it does in this game, although 
you've got the option to muck around with 
some of the historical facts. For example, you 
can have the Italians on either your side or 
with the enemy (whether you're playing the 
Allies or Germany). Given their military record, 
it makes more sense to have them on the 
opposing side. Hem hem. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b><i>Sound and graphics 
alright, are they?</i></b><br>
Compared to many games of this ilk, they most 
certainly are. The whole game is played on one 
map which scrolls at just the right speed in four 
directions. There are mountains, roads, towns, 
ports and airfields all over the place. There's also 
loads of little troop, tank and half-track 
icons dotted about. Every time you 
have a go, the situation advances a 
week. So it takes about three weeks, 
or three turns, to cross from one side 
of Italy to the other. For a marching 
army, this sounds pretty reasonable. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst the graphics aren't bad, the sound is pretty 
poor. But what do you expect in a game like this? 
There are beeps to tell you if you've done something 
wrong, and explosions for heavy bombardments. 
Machine-gun sounds for big battles might have been a 
nice touch, but you'd probably get really sick of them by 
your fifth battle. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The actual game-play is a lot of fun. It doesn't take 
you long to amass some serious firepower which you 
can then chuck at the enemy. One thing that is rather 
annoying is that when units are in combat, the game 
doesn't tell you what damage they're doing to each 
other. You can click on any of your units afterwards to 
find out how strong they are, but in the heat of battle 
you can only sit there and grit your teeth. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All told, <i>Avalanche</i> is a pretty good wargame. I especially liked the speed of it all. There's no faffing around 
and as each turn only takes about two minutes, you 
can move swiftly on to the next bout of fighting. The 
two skill levels mean that you can win without the brain 
of a Montgomery or the moustache and stupid haircut 
of a Hitler. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best way to play is to rope in a gullible friend. 
Halfway through the game, make a peace agreement 
with him and send him off to the kitchen to make some 
tea. While he's out of the room you can wipe out his 
entire tank division, leaving his left flank seriously 
weakened. When he comes back, finish his troops off 
in front of him and wait for a cup of tea to land 
in your lap. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes folks, <i>Avalanche</i> is a definite 
wargame for the definite wargame fan., 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><center><b>10 FACTS ABOUT ITALY</b><br>
<br>1. It's filled with Romans and Italians.
<br>2. It changes its Government about twice a week
<br>3. It's shaped like a sort of boot.
<br>4. Whereas Sicily, at the 'toe', is shaped a little like a flattened kidney.
<br>5. Italians are very shiny and shout and wave their arms a lot.
<br>6. Iceland has had a traditional territorial dispute with Italy.
<br>7. But they haven't gone to war.
<br>8. Because they'll both lose. Y'see, both are a bit crap, militarily speaking.
<br>9. In fact, Italy's a bit crap.
<br>10. Except for Linda's mum, who's Italian and not crap at all.
