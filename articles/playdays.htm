<div><b>When I were a lad <i>(You 
forgot the 'Eee'. Ed)</i> 
learning wasn't supposed 
to be fun. Fear was the key 
word - though at first, of 
course, we didn't know that because F 
wasn't taught until we'd gone through 
A to E. Short, sharp shock treatment, 
that's what it was all about. And it 
didn't do me any harm. (Wibble.) </b>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, I admit it. I'm jealous. I wish there had 
been educational computer games when I was 
a tot. It would have been much more beneficial 
than spending my time avoiding flying chalk 
and chanting times tables. Of course in those 
days the games would nave been based on 
classics like <i>Ivor the Engine</i> or <i>Noggin the 
Nog</i>. Sadly, these, never, get repeated so 
instead the games are based on the under-fives' faves of the moment. Hence <i>Playdays</i>. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b><i>Whatever happened to 
Hamble anyway?</i></b><br>
<i>Playdays</i> the programme is what <i>Play School</i> 
mutated into via a brief moment when it was 
called <i>Playbus</i> (which explains the bus motif 
on the cover and during the credits). The star 
of the show is an avine of indeterminate 
species called the Why Bird. In <i>Playdays</i> the 
program, said bird acts as your host 
throughout the thirteen different activities (or 
games) and constantly gives you 
encouragement. If you get things wrong you're 
not lambasted and told to stand in the comer 
with a dunce's hat on. Instead Why Bird will 
say something like, 'Try again,' or 'That was 
nearly right,' or 'You're crap,' <i>(Er, not really. 
Ed)</i> and give you an extra clue to help you on 
your way to enlightenment (or something).

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thirteen games cover a wide range of 
skills. There's everything from shape 
recognition and counting to grids and dot-to-dot puzzles in there. The format of the program 
is fairly ingenious and, if nothing else, makes 
all the loading a bit more bearable by lumping 
together certain activities and letters in blocks. 
It's also an approach which means that the 
activities are chosen seemingly at random, so 
a child will never know what to expect next. 
(Actually, it's far from random, but, hey, who's 
taking notes?) <i>(You are, I hope. Ed)</i> 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The program presents you with a choice of 
six letters. If you choose J the program uses 
words like jumper and job in all the activities, 
choose T and you get trees and, er, something 
else beginning with T (and so on). If you don't 
want any of the letters in that set, you get 
another lot, after enduring a bit more loading. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once you've chosen a letter you are first 
shown six pictures all starting with your chosen 
letter, then it's on to the activities. Depending 
on which letter you've chosen you get to play a 
different set of games. When you've completed 
them you get to see a high score table which 
shows you how well you've done, then you can 
go back and select another letter. The only 
letter this doesn't apply to is X. Select X and 
you are taken into a specific set of three 
games - Noughts and Crosses, Treasure and 
Shapes and Colours. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b><i>We'd quite like some 
education, actually</i></b><br>
There is a difficulty setting which makes the 
game suitable for three to eight year olds - or 
so the manual tells us. Personally, I reckon the 
activities are a bit too simple and samey to 
appeal to any child over six. Also the program 
boasts a vocabulary of over 250 words, but 
when you divide this by twenty-five (the letters 
you can play with) this works out at about, er 
(scribble, scribble) ten words per letter, which 
ain't that many. Folk of eight should certainly 
know more. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using the same background graphics for 
every game also robs the program of 
excitement. A bit more variety would have 
made it more appealing.

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the plus side, great use is made of the 
characters from the TV programme. Why Bird 
is an excellent host, and particularly well-drawn. Other characters, such as Wobble the 
clown, pop up to congratulate good work. Also 
the control system, which uses the joystick to 
select letters, is simple to use, though for the very 
young it would be best for a guide to stick around 
(especially to keep 'em interested during the 
loading). 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the scheme of educational programs, 
<i>Playdays</i> is on a level with the early <i>Fun School</i>s, 
but way behind such fare as <i><a href="theshoepeople.htm">The Shoe People</a></i>. If 
you're only going to buy one educational program, 
this isn't it. Decent, but no award-winner. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>CARD GAMES</b><br>
<i>Playdays</i> comes with a set of rather 
spiffy colour cards that don't link in with 
the program at all, but are great fun. 
Bright and colourful, you can use 'em to 
fill in that interminable wait for the tape 
to load with all sorts of games. Our 
panel of reviewers took a look. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dave</b> I reckon you could tear off the names 
and numbers from the bottom of the cards 
using the handy perforations and match the 
words with the pictures. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Jonathan</b> No, that's far too dull. I think a spot 
of Tarot would while away the time nicely. 
Separate the numbers and words 
with the aid of the handy 
perforations, shuffle them, then lay 
down a set of pictures. Under those 
put a line of numbers or words. 
Then try to work out what a 'parrot 
over twenty shoes next to a 'three 
cups over a foot' could possibly 
mean on an astrological level. Pat 
Sharpe to be the new Doctor Who perhaps? 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Andy</b> Well. I reckon you could make really 
good card castles. By tearing off the bottoms 
(my, those perforations are handy) you have 
two different size of cards, which 
means you can make some really
wacky castles. A hit, definitely. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>80%</b>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>X MARKS THE SPOT</b><p>
<b>Noughts and Crosses</b> You 
play the noughts and Why 
Bird gets the crosses. I think 
you know the rules to this one. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Treasure</b> There's treasure 
hidden under one of those 
squares. Click on one and 
you're told whether you are hot or 
cold (ie near to the loot or not). Try to 
locate the prize in as few goes as is 
humanly possible. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Shapes and Colours</b> Do the 
colours match? Are the 
shapes not entirely 
dissimilar? On the harder levels the 
Why Bird cheats by changing the size of the 
objects or rotating them. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>THE GAMES</b><br>
as Described by Someone with No Patience At All 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Matching</b> Match the word with the picture. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Snap</b> Obvious. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Odd One Out</b> Obvious. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Counting</b> Again, obvious. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>What's Gone?</b> I haven't got time for this. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Spelling</b> I've an urgent appointment, you know. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Moving Window</b> You get to glimpse a small 
portion of a large picture though a small roving 
window. Of which there are no more in my 
diary, get the idea? 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dot-to-Dot</b> Do you really need me to explain 
this? Dots, more dots, join them, happy? 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Sliding Puzzle</b> It's a puzzle, and bits of it slide 
around. What do you want, blood? 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Rhyme</b> Each letter has its own little rhyme for 
you to read. Edward Lear has nothing to worry 
about, apart from being dead of course. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Very Obvious Game</b> Indeed Right, I'm going.
