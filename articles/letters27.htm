<p> <font size=4><b> WELL FANCY THAT</b></font><br> There are two reasons why I am writing this letter. First of all, I would like to say thank you for the free stickers which you gave away a long time ago, and secondly to say that you are a lifesaver. How is this, you might ask? Well, last Christmas my faithful Speccy broke down so I packed it away and sent it to Specialist Computer Repairs, and after about six weeks I got it back. Three days later it broke down again so back it went. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, as you know the company went bankrupt, and I didn't know my computer's serial number, but the only thing that saved it was one of the stickers that you gave away a long time ago. <br> <b> Nigel Wakeling <br> Cwm Penmachno, <br> Gwynedd <br> </b> <br><i> I knew our stickers were good - but not that good! Lifesaving, eh? It makes me feel all warm inside to think that a </i>YS<i> gift should breathe life into a poor ailing Speccy! Hope the cover mounted games came in just as useful. Maybe you could stick them together and make a lifeboat. <b>Ed</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> WELL USEFUL</b></font><br> Here's a useful tip for +3 owners. A 0.1 mfd capacitor across the Load jack will convert the input circuitry so that it'll work with any tape recorder. It's a pity that Amstrad couldn't afford the expense of a whole 10p to do this modification! <br> <b> G A Bobker <br> Unsworth, Bury <br> </b> <br><i> Sounds like a well crucial tip there. But make sure you know what you're doing before you try this. And remember never attempt to fettle about in a Speccy's innards with the power switched on! <b>Ed</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> BOG RHYMES</b></font><br> How utterly pervgusting of you! I refer to December's Star Letter, ie the poem written in Irish. Obviously nobody in the <i>YS</i> offices can speak Irish (even Irish people have problems!) so I shall give you a loose (but fairly accurate) translation: 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind is screaming through my hole(!!!) 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without stopping, without stopping. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>(Do we want any more of this? Ed) ( YEAH! Rest of staff) </i> 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your breast (oo-er!) is like a large mountain, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your legs are like a boat. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe you're not a ... <i>(Right! Stop it there! Ed) </i> 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note that the poet's grammar is dismal in places, so this translation was the best I could manage. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a member of the People Who Are Worried About Increasing Perviness In <i>YS</i>, I shall haul you before the courts unless you immediately give this the Star Letter and denounce Ciontaigh O Cialla as a perv with bad grammar. <br> <b> Stanley The Elk MBE (aka <br> Jim Shine) <br> Dungarvan, Co Waterford <br> </b> <br><i> I was shocked and stunned when I read your translation. Are you sure it's right? Ciontaigh may well be a perv with bad grammar but at least he's donated the games to a worthwhile cause. I'm afraid you don't get the Star Letter 'cos I don't want to encourage this sort of thing. Not only that, you might start translating </i>YS<i>! <b>Ed</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> SHELLY OR SHAN'T HE?</b></font><br> I was delighted to see that you gave me the Star Letter in the December issue. That was just one of my many poems from my new book, <i>"Ciontaigh 0 Cialla's Love Poems"</i>. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding my prize of three free games, I would like to donate them to a children's charity, as I can accept no material reward for my poetry. <br> <b> Ciontaigh O Cialla <br> Carryblusk, Co Cork <br> </b> <br><i> After finding out what your poem said I wasn't going to send three games to you anyway. You should be ashamed of yourself you disgusting pervert. Thankfully nobody else knows what a truly indecent human being you really are. Still, at least the games are now going to a good cause. We'll send them to the NSPCC on your behalf. <b>Ed</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> OO-ER!</b></font><br> I'm writing this letter in my kitchen while my mum and sister are talking. (Believe me, it's awfully hard. ) <br> <b> Danny Kings <br> Hanley Swan, Worcester <br> </b> <br><i> Thank you Danny, but we didn't wish to know that - kindly leave the stage. <b>Ed</b>. </i> <p> <font size=4><b> HATSTAND</b></font><br> It's me again. What do you mean, Who? Who else writes in blood with a sea dart missile? Phil does? Oh... sorry... sniffle... 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call me Susan if you like, but T'zer is short for 'The Zer', an ancient poliographical megacure for zits. Don't worry, your secret's safe with me! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And behold, three bright lights materialized, and did hover over downtown Nazareth for two hours, and of course this proves conclusively that the only similarity between ZZ Top and the Zero Option is that they both have long hair... eh? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Je voudrais apologise pour cette v daft letter, but wot the hell, wot are you if you're not mad? <br> <b> Captain Chaos <br> Burnley, Lancs <br> </b> <br><i> Wot indeed? I haven't the faintest idea what you're wittering on about but we were rather short of letters so we're putting it in anyway. <b>Ed</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> WORRA BERK</b></font><br> I think that 'the thing upstairs' in <i><a href="trapdoor.htm">Trap Door</a></i> is in fact our one and only Phil South. Two clues to this are 1) 'The thing upstairs' eats a lot, same as Phil, and 2) They're both fat and cuddly slobs. <br> <b> Phil Houghton <br> Carlisle, Cumbria <br> </b> <br><i> I really think you're being totally unfair. 'The thing upstairs' couldn't possibly eat as much as Phil and I doubt he's as fat and cuddly. And anyway Phil doesn't work for a Berk. <b>Ed</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> POINT-LESS</b></font><br> I will get straight to the point, as I feel that a letter should always be right to the point with no beating about the bush so to speak - or write - so here it is - the point of the letter, that is <i>(Get on with it. Ed)</i>. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a Vic 20 owner and am intending to send it to you bit by bit, piece by piece, if you don't send me a badge. I must warn you that I own a fair bit of software for the Vic, and having that sent to you in the post all the time is not a nice thing to happen, I can tell you. To prove my threat is real, I enclose a Vic 20 program, with the reminder that more will come if you don't do as I ask. <br> <b> Stephen Bond <br> Plymouth, Devon <br> </b> POKE 36878,10 <br> FOR L=230 TO 128 STEP -1 <br> POKE 36876, L <br> FOR M=1 TO 20 <br> NEXT M <br> NEXT L <br> POKE 36876,0 <br> POKE 36877,200 <br> FOR L=15 TO 0 STEP -.05 <br> POKE 36878,L <br> NEXT L <br> POKE 36877,0 <br> <br><i> Oh my God! Not the Vic 20 program please. Anything but that! Okay, okay, I'll send you a badge if you promise never to send me anything remotely Vic 20 like again. <b>Ed</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> SHORT CHANGED</b></font><br> I am utterly confounded with disbelief. I walked into the newsagents and grabbed my <i>YS</i>, and found I had forgotten about the free <i><a href="viz.htm">VIZ</a></i> comic. As I bought a packet of crisps a cheeky sales woman suddenly said "Let me see your receipt." So I handed it over, and she took my <i>YS</i> away. Two minutes later she came back and said "I'm sorry but the mag with it is offensive and you are not allowed to have it." 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you had to be 18 to buy it, I demand a Trainspotter Award as this wasn't printed on the mag. If I was ripped off then I demand a free copy of <i><a href="viz.htm">VIZ</a></i> immediately. <br> <b> M Andrews <br> Radcliffe, Manchester <br> </b> <br><i> You're quite right, you do not have to be 18 to get a copy of </i><a href="viz.htm">VIZ</a><i>. Unfortunately, some newsagents objected to </i><a href="viz.htm">VIZ</a><i>, considering it vulgar, and so removed it from the magazine. I'm afraid the only way to get a copy is to buy a Back Issue as we don't have any here in the office. <b>Ed</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> ANNIE'S SONG</b></font><br> Sorry to be so bold, but do you have any jobs at Rathbone Place? Obviously I would pay for such a privilege. I'm sorry I can only afford to pay &pound;100 a week but I have to buy important things like food. <br> <b> Jon Denver <br> St Ives, Cornwall <br> </b> <br><i> You're hired! Has your singing career taken a turn for the worse then? I can't honestly say I'm surprised. <b>Ed</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> AAAHHH, STROARDINARY!</b></font><br> In the October edition of <i>Your Sinclair</i>, the review of <i><a href="renegade.htm">Renegade</a></i> got 9 and a megagame. In the November edition <i><a href="draughtsgenius.htm">Draughts Genius</a></i> by Rack-it got the same marks as <i><a href="renegade.htm">Renegade</a></i> and only got eight. Why is this? <br> <b> David Coleman <br> Litherland, Liverpool <br> </b> <br><i> The TOTAL mark isn't worked out as an average of the other marks - it's just the reviewer's overall impression of the game. And as reviewers tend to mark differently (being different people) you often get what seem like contradictory marks. But it's still reasonable, I'd say, for both games to have the same graphics, playability, vfm and addictiveness marks, while </i><a href="renegade.htm">Renegade</a><i> is judged better, in the end, than </i><a href="draughtsgenius.htm">Draughts Genius</a><i>. That's really what the TOTAL mark is for. <b>Marcus</b> </i> <p> <TABLE align=center BORDER BGCOLOR=white BACKGROUND=""><TR><TD> <FONT SIZE=6><B><U>STAR LETTER</U></b></font><br><font size=4><b> STICKY PROBLEM</b></font><br> As you know, in the past people have had trouble getting your free games off the mag. Until now, that is. I have developed a way of getting them off without tearing anything. So just follow these simple instructions: 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Lift the cassette a centimetre off the cover. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Place your hands (make sure they're washed) under the tape. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Lift off the tape Slowly.

The mag's great but I don't know about the 'free' game on the front! How can you have the nerve to put out a game as bad as <i><a href="playforyourlife.htm">Play For Your Life</a></i>? More like <i>Plague Of Your Life</i>. This game is totally hopeless! You can never tell where the ball actually is! You just cannot do 3D effects with this type of game! It does not work! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another criticism - <i><a href="roadrace.htm">Road Race</a></i>! I don't know how you can say that you 'ran me ragged'. I certainly didn't play the stupid pathetic lousy game more than once! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, congratulations on <i><a href="batty.htm">Batty</a></i>, Great! Now that is a game I have played more than once! Now I know you can do better than <i><a href="roadrace.htm">Road Race</a></i> and <i>Plague Of Your Life</i> (oops, sorry), so keep up your good name <i>(I always thought T'zer was a pretty silly name myself. Phil)</i> and don't let yourself down! <br> <b> Andrew Witt <br> Salisbury, Wilts (Does it?) <br> </b> <br><i> One out of three ain't bad! What are you moaning about?

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, what a load of pitiful crap it was (the game, that is). While waiting for it to load I was thinking about the other games you've done, the best of the lot being <i><a href="batty.htm">Batty</a></i> For Play For Your Life, though, I've compiled my own clapometer.

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Don't you think you went megagame mad in the January '88 ish? Out of the 25 reviews, 11 were megagames. I'm sure the reviewers got tiddly on the Christmas liquers! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Do you intend to raise the price of <i>YS</i>, like other magazines I could mention? <i>Crash</i>!!! Oh dear, the cat's been Zzapped!!! <i>(Very subtle. Ed)</i> 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Your mag's strong and weak points. The letters page should be much longer. And the reviews are too short. Look at the <i><a href="slaine.htm">Slaine</a></i> review in January. Less than half a page was given to the game, yet you gave it a megagame status! Surely you could have moved the <i>Basil</i> review somewhere else in the mag so as to give <i><a href="slaine.htm">Slaine</a></i> a full page? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Getting John Minson from <i>Crash</i> was sheer genius, as his column is an excellent read. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) I've run out of points. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Goodbye. <br> <b> John Hunt <br> Irvine, Ayrshire <br> </b> <br><i> (1) I agree. It's always tricky at that time of the year, as companies usually release their best stuff in the run-up to Christmas - and standards generally have gone up in the past year or two. Remember too that different reviewers have different enthusiasms. I myself wouldn't have given either </i>Aliens US<i> or </i><a href="slaine.htm">Slaine</a><i> a megagame, but Phil thought they were brill, so megagames they were. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Not for the moment. We'll only go up in price when we need to. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Well it all comes down to space, and we never have enough. We'd love four pages of letters each month, but there just ain't the room. It's the same with reviews. With </i><a href="slaine.htm">Slaine</a><i>, though, remember we did a double page preview on it a few months back which is why we didn't make too much of a hoohah about it this time around. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Yup, I agree. (5) Seems so. (6) Bye. <b>Marcus</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> VITYMINS</b></font><br> Ouch, phew, fab! Wow, beasty, an intelligible thing, was it not? <i><a href="moleychristmas.htm">Moley Christmas</a></i> or whatever it's called. It has ace 128 music, smart graphics and after half an hour I've got to level three. Here are my percentages: 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Road Racer</i> - 55% - okay. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><a href="batty.htm">Batty</a></i> - 85% - Raz! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><a href="playforyourlife.htm">Play For Your Life</a></i> - 65% - not too bad. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><a href="moleychristmas.htm">Moley Christmas</a></i> - 88% - Ace. 
<BR>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><i><a href="cobra.htm">Cobra</a></i>/Ocean </b><br> Don't push him. He's gonna fall off that ledge or else. More mindless violence with the BIG man.
