<div>It's been 18 months since 
Tartan's last release, <I><a href="doubleagent.htm">Double 
Agent</a></I>, and looking at the 
programming work that's gone 
into this new one I'm not 
surprised! The result is a 
headache of an adventure that's totally 
different from anything you've ever 
played before, and guaranteed to keep 
you scratching your head for months on 
end. There are two modes of play, easy 
and hard, and as the easy one is 
impossible, anyone playing the hard level 
deserves a medal - or a medical check-up. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Gordello</I> is a three-part, text-only 
adventure which tells the tale of the evil 
Dr Gordello and his clinic in Switzerland. 
It's here that he has perfected the 
technique of making clones of animals, 
and is now experimenting on humans. 
The actual storyline is as complicated as 
a piece of knotted string, but it's all 
explained in the optional instructions. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few of these knots in the plot 
unravel in places where they shouldn't. 
For instance, you are an agent for the S6 
secret service in London and your boss 
has received a video from Gordello that 
he claims shows you and a clone at his 
Swiss clinic. In other words, he claims 
you are a done, the original being under 
his control in Switzerland! Your boss 
disproves this by the simple technique of 
asking you your phone number, as the 
imperfect clones cannot remember 
numbers. But a moment later you 
discover your task is to unite the two 
present sub-standard dones in the 
Clonetron machine and thereby produce 
a super-clone, capable of speech. So if 
your boss already knows that the two 
current clones are not capable of speech, 
what on earth is this phone number 
nonsense all about? As long as you can 
speak, you can't be a sub-standard clone 
anyway. On top of that, if your boss 
knows that uniting the sub-standard 
dones in the Clonetron will produce a 
super-clone, how come Gordello hasn't 
twigged yet? I think the plot's got so 
convoluted it's totally out of control. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, ignore all that and get on with 
the game. Just do what you're told and 
you'll be alright. At first glance the split-screen looks identical to <I><a href="doubleagent.htm">Double Agent</a></I>, 
and even at second glance too, with the 
AB clone's half of the game on the left-hand side, and the BA clone's down the 
fight. You can conveniently control both 
clones from a keyboard in London, but 
only one at a time, switching between 
them by typing AB or BA. You can also 
type P to pause, and believe me you'll 
need to! 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The BA clone has a design flaw 
(another one!) in that it does the 
opposite of what you tell it, so GET 
JACKET will result in the jacket being 
dropped. In fact this isn't fully 
implemented as commands like SEARCH 
and STEAL still work as they should - 
maybe the author couldn't think of 
convenient opposites. I know I can't. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part One requires you to manoeuvre 
both clones into the ante-room of the 
Clonetron machine, avoiding the various 
guards who are wandering round the 
place. The clones are in different areas of 
the laboratory, the only joint location 
being the ante-room, so no co-operation 
between the two is needed and you can 
solve the problems on one half of the 
screen first then go on to the other, or 
flip between the two as you go along. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I thought Part One was complicated 
(and I did) then Part Two gets even 
worse. The twist, as if we needed one, is 
that the two clones bumped their heads 
together when leaving the ante-room at 
the end of Part One, the result being that 
they now both respond when you type in 
a command, with the one you're in 
current contact with acting first. Don't 
forget, though, that clone BA still does 
the opposite of what you tell it, so if you 
type in SOUTH then AB goes south in 
his half of the screen while BA goes 
north in his half! At least they start off in 
the same place, and you're only faced 
with making one map in this part, not 
two separate ones. But how on earth do 
you get both clones to the Clonetron 
simultaneously when one always does 
the opposite to what you say, an there 
seems to be only one entrance to the 
machine? I get a headache just thinking 
about it. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you get to Part Three, which I 
estimate should take you 'til about 1999 
when the story is actually set, then you 
will at last have managed to create the 
single super-clone. So what happens to 
the second half of the screen? Can we 
kiss it goodbye? No chance. In that 
window you can now control any one of 
the 14 other characters that are moving 
around. Type CALL SOLDIER, for 
instance, and it's the soldier's view of the 
adventure you see on the right-hand 
side. My mind not only boggles it 
double-boggles at the programming 
problems there must have been. If it took 
18 months to write I reckon Tom Frost 
must have been working a 36-hour day. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, the fourth part of this three-part adventure is a bonus program that 
gives you some news you definitely will 
not want to hear when you get to the end 
of the game. There's also a couple of 
puzzle games as a reward for finishing. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Gordello</I> is a fascinating adventure, and 
in amongst all these complications of 
plot, screen layout, character-switching 
and programming there are some clever 
puzzles as well. The features in the game 
aren't just gimmicks, they are actually 
part of the story and part of the problems 
too. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only simple thing is the 
fact that it's an excellent game that you 
ought to rush out and buy immediately. 
Then rush in again as you can't buy it 
outside and send off your money to 
Tartan Software the noo!
