"Dear Mike, I'm writing to you from Wormwood Scrubs," my first letter begins. Well look, I can tell you how to get out of the Goblins' Dungeon, but I think jailbreaks is going a bit far. Ah, I see, it's just another epistle from <b>Jon Rose</b>, who says he's serving time for the theft of &pound;250,000 worth of goods from <I>Very Big Cave Adventure</I>, and it's all my fault for answering his questions on it. Jon got a clue sheet from CRL, but that didn't tell him where to find the record and the jemmy. The sheet also says you only need take the belt and the lamp from part one to part two, but we reckon you've got to have the rod and some food as well. Anyone disagree? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Always nice to hear of a reader doing well, and that's the case with <b>Craig Davies</b> of Bodkin Software from Blackpool, whose adventure <I>Murder Hunt</I> I gave a so-so review to in the October <I>YS</I>. Not bad but could have been better, I reckoned. Craig's written a spoof adventure called <I><a href="custerdsquest.htm">Custerd's Quest</a></I> (well that's how he spelt it), to be published on CRL's Alpha Omega label. It's also interested in looking at his <I>Murder Hunt II</I>, which is nearing completion. Good on yer, Craig, and thanks too for responding to a reader's pleas for POKEs for <I><a href="adventuregreats.htm">Bored Of The Rings</a></I>. If you want to carry an unlimited number of objects in any <I>Quill</I>'d game, then POKE 27538,254 (or whatever number of objects you prefer). 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>P. Harvey</b> of Plymouth can't leave the ship to get started on <I>Message From Andromeda</I>: EVAEL/KCOLRIA NEPO/DNAL/EGASSEM DAER. Alternatively, just EIBEERF A ROF DNES. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Chris Barker</b> of Peterborough asks about the release of <I>Questprobe IV</I>, though I can't tell you anything about that other than I wouldn't hold your breath waiting, and Chris also asks for tips on <I>Questprobe III</I>, where he can't seem to get anywhere. Here you do need to hold your breath, that's when you're Thing, but first as Torch you get the candle and FLY TARPIT. Then switch, take the candle, WAIT 5, hold your breath, switch, then when Thing goes under type FLAME ON HIGH and LIGHT TAR. Torch can then FLY HILLS while Thing can FEEL DOWN a few times then SMASH MACHINERY. I've gone into that in detail as it's a complicated problem confusing lots of people. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Danny Kelley</b> of London asks about <I><a href="adventuregreats.htm">Eureka</a></I>. After using the sheets and the rope in wartime Germany, you should take the items from the battlements, go back in again and think about using matches, getting cigarettes and pulling levers. Use the crowbar a few moves after moving the stove. As for giving the money in Roman times, I think it's just GIVE COIN. In the Arthurian section, you can win armour from gambling with Sir Malin, and this acts as protection against a few opponents. To get the harp I think you need the sack. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next to <I><a href="dracula.htm">Dracula</a></I>, where many people can't get past the start of part two, and Michael Brown of Sheffield who tells me he's done everything to stop himself freezing to death, even jumping up and down, so what more can he do? TAES EHT TFIL DNA DNUORA KOOL. That should set you on your way to finding some blankets. The other main problem at the start, of course, is the woman. Here you SEYE ENIMAXE. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As well as being a well-known pain in the neck, CRL's <I><a href="dracula.htm">Dracula</a></I> can be a strain on the eyes, as the release version had an unpleasant character set that wasn't evident in our screenshots from a pre-release copy - the price had gone up by a couple of quid, too! <I>C J Livesey</I> of Poole has sent me a routine to change the character set, though unfortunately it has no effect on the price. First you load the Basic header, which is the first set of red/blue lines. Then stop the tape and press BREAK. In immediate mode enter POKE 23899,201: POKE 23900,0: POKE 23901,0. Type RUN, press ENTER, then when loading stops with the OK message type NEW then RAND USR 24933 and a legible game should be yours. After that, coping with Dracula will be a doddle. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More on eyes, and <b>R A Oliver</b> from Suffolk asks how to deal with the ones in <I>An Everyday Tale Of A Seeker Of Gold</I>. Well, I'm sure there's a POKE to deal with that somewhere. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An impossible question from Raymond Cairns of Manchester - should he buy a copy of <I>GAC</I>, even though he's only written a few small programs so far. I do sympathise when you say that &pound;22.95 is a lot of money when you're 12 years old, but I can't tell you Yes or No simply because I've no idea whether you'll be able to cope with it or not. Some people take to it like a duck to water, others find it a struggle and give up. I don't think it's too hard to master, provided you're patient and READ THE MANUAL CAREFULLY, and it doesn't really matter whether you've programmed or not, as it's not a programming utility, though it does have similarities to the way a program is built up. Maybe try buying <I>The Quill</I>, which is a lot cheaper if you only get the basic text program, and see whether you can manage to use that. If you find it impossible, then you can give up without being too much out of pocket, and if you enjoy it you can add <I>The Illustrator</I> and other bits and bobs later. Don't forget there are some who swear by <I>The Quill</I> and wouldn't give <I>GAC</I> house room, though I do tend to prefer the latter. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone from Southampton who signs himself <b>Running Hedgehog</b> - sounds like he ought to be run over to me. He asks which is better, <I>Quill</I> or <I>GAC</I>, and whether any royalties are payable when selling adventures written on those systems. Well I've said I prefer <I>GAC</I>, though I can't really say that one is better than the other, but I can definitely say that no royalties or fees are payable, though obviously both Incentive and Gilsoft would like it if you mentioned their products in the adventure's credits. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>David Mackie</b> of Glasgae says he can get up to 84 percent on <I><a href="adventuregreats.htm">Hampstead</a></I>, but no further and he sent for an information sheet but that didn't help much at all. What??? Can't have been my freebie as that answers David's questions, like where to find Pippa (at the cocktail party), is there anything to be found in Covent Garden (the cocktail party), and where to drive Pippa (away from the cocktail party... well, to be more helpful, go to St John's Wood and do the decent thing.) 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Help wanted on <I><a href="colourofmagic.htm">The Colour Of Magic</a></I> by <b>Ian Sealy</b> of Rugby - !EUSSI SIHT NOITULOS EHT AT KOOL - Though how anyone can call themselves an adventurer when they have to ask what use the saucer of milk and the cat are, I don't know. Do yourself and the cat a favour, and give it the milk. You'll get your reward later. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Chris Read</b> of Hants will likely get a thump later, addressing me as Sir/Madame. Still, as he or she has been struggling for weeks on <I>The NeverEnding Story</I> I shall forgive this, and say that to go underground you'll need the glowglobe for light, and to enter the Ivory Tower you UNLOCK DOOR but require the Gold Key to do it. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm quite used to experts like <b>John Wilson</b> and <b>John Barnsley</b> sending me solutions to an adventure before my review of the game has appeared in print, mainly because of the inevitable publication delays, but this time <b>Graham Collier</b> has really beaten everyone to it by sending me a solution to <I><a href="kayleth.htm">Kayleth</a></I> in the same post as the <I>YS</I> review copy arrived! Graham sends his letters to me on tape, which is different, but although I appreciate it I wouldn't like to encourage it too much as you don't get loading problems with more conventional letters! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally a special hello to my Huntingdon pals, <b>Chris</b>, <b>Ben</b> and <b>Tim</b>. Tim wants to know how to get out of the mansion in <I>Kwah!</I> - actually I've no idea. Does anyone? Ben asks how to get the GET and DROP commands working in <i>GAC</i> - half my postbag these days seems to ask about <I>GAC</I>. Anyway, to get something you mainly have to check that the object is there, but there could be a little confusion over the numbering that you use. Don't forget that an object and a noun may well have different numbers. When it's used as a noun in the input, you might have defined gold as an object table. Let's assume that's the case, and that in your verb table, GET is verb number seven, which it will be if you use the Quickstart file. The command line to get something should then be: IF (VERB 7 AND NOUN 1 AND HERE 3) GET 3 OKAY END. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In plain English what that's saying is that if the player has typed in verb seven followed by noun one (GET GOLD) and object number 3 is here in the location (HERE 3) then get the object, say "OK" and end that input routine. The command for DROP works in a similar way, but there you check that the object is being carried (CARR 3 instead of HERE 3). 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GOT THAT? OKAY? END.
