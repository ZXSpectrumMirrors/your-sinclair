<div>The trouble with being a 
reviewer is that you have to 
give opinions about 
everything. That's not 
normally a problem, but what 
happens when you can't make 
your mind up, as I can't with 
Zenobi's latest game, <i>The 
Pendant Of Logryn</i>? It certainly 
got off to a great start, being 
available on +3 disk, meaning 
quick and easy loading and quick 
and easy saving of games. Well 
done, Zenobi, for supporting those 
with disk drives... and I've more 
exciting news of Zenobi disks next 
month. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, who is Logryn? 
And why's his pendant so 
important? Well, Logryn's the 
King, that's who, and his 
pendant's important 'cos he's lost 
it, that's why. It was given to him 
on the grand occasion of his 110th 
birthday... by his grandmother! 
And granny's about to take a trip 
to visit Logryn, which is why you, 
Kormin, an 'umble elf, are also 
about to take a trip. And why? 
Don't all shout at once - to find 
the pendant! Logryn kindly hands 
you a sword and two gold pieces, 
pats you on the head (which is 
better than patting you on the 
bottom, you must admit), and 
sends you off into the land of the 
humans. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Pendant</i> is <i>PAWS</i>'d by one 
Jamie Murphy, a new name to 
me, but it's a name to watch out 
for as the game's certainly well 
done from a programming and 
presentation point of view. The 
graphics are simple but 
attractive, and quick to appear. 
You can switch them off if you 
like, or have them permanently 
on, or have them only appear the 
first time you visit a location. 
There are also five different 
presentation options, called up by 
typing in MODE 0-4, and these 
mainly affect whether location 
text or responses stay on the 
screen or scroll off. On top of that 
there's the usual range of <i>PAWS</i> 
features, like RAMSAVE, use of 
ALL commands, speech to 
characters and complex inputs. A 
nice idea is that many of the 
objects you find, or creatures you 
encounter, are shown on the 
screen if you decide to have a 
closer look at them. EXAMINE 
SWORD and up pops the piccie 
with the info underneath - "A 
well-balanced weapon but not 
very sharp". Sounds like a sword-sharpening job will be called for 
at some stage. I also love the 
graphic of the ogre that comes up, 
when you encounter this creature. 
I don't much care for the ogre, as 
the nasty thing won't let me past, 
but I like its picture. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this sounds hunky-dory, 
doesn't it? So why am I undecided 
about the game? It's just that... 
well... it's a bit dull, that's all. 
Now I like making maps as much 
as the next adventurer, but this 
game has far too many 
meaningless locations. You'll
know the type of thing if you've 
played Level 9's <i>Knight Orc</i> - 
"You are on a rough road", "You 
are on a dusty road", "You are on 
a rough and dusty road" and so 
on. My elf self jumped for joy 
about every 20 minutes or so 
when I actually found another 
character, an object or something 
to do. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Pendant</i> is definitely a game to 
map on the back of a roll of spare 
wallpaper -- even then you'll 
probably need the wallpaper 
paste before you've finished. You 
begin by exploring the forest, and 
note one or two things to come 
back to later - an arrow stuck in a 
tree out of reach and an immense 
tree whose trunk proves 
impossible to climb. In another 
direction is the city, with the 
inevitable Magick Shoppe and 
Supplies Shoppe, whose owner is 
fast asleep allowing you to pick up 
the equally inevitable lamp and 
backpack and walk out with 
them. This was so easy I made 
sure to RAMSAVE the game as I 
was waiting for him to wake up 
and chase after me with an axe. 
About two hours of playing time 
later he still hadn't done it so I 
guess I'm safe. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elsewhere there are boulders to 
block your path, caves, waterfalls, 
an old woman in a house, a 
signpost you can't read, a ring you 
can rub, orcs, ogres, a jeweller to 
buy your treasure, wandering 
tradesmen to sell you stuff like 
knives, dark tunnels that need a 
light, a chasm where the rope-bridge has collapsed and even a 
riddle to answer. In fact every 
adventuring idea you can think of 
and have seen ten times before... 
though I haven't yet found the 
obligatory maze or someone 
flogging a map. It can only be a 
matter of time though! 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've even found the obligatory 
spelling mistake and essential 
bug - "hurriedly" is spelt 
"hurridly" in the location next to 
the South Gate of the city, while if 
you EXAMINE GRASS in the 
place where it's 'tremendously 
long' (having searched it once and 
found some goodies), you're told to 
make sure that your disk is not 
write-protected. Yes, fine, 
whatever you say. There's even 
the obligatory bit of frustration, 
as in two places you find ledges 
which you cannot get onto 
because your boots are too smooth 
and slippy. Try to REMOVE 
BOOTS and you're told you're not 
wearing any. A bit more thought 
needed on that problem, 
methinks. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet, and yet... new players 
might love the game, as there's 
plenty to do, and if you find a 
problem stumping you in one 
direction you can go off in several 
others and explore to your heart's 
content. I've been exploring for 
hours and still haven't been down 
every avenue open to me. It looks 
like excellent value for money, a 
good sizeable game. But unless I 
come across something original 
soon I may well not want to 
devote another few hours to it, 
when there are other more 
exciting adventures still 
unfinished... and even unstarted!
