<b>Racing games, eh? (As 
our Jack would start a review.) 
What'd we do without 'em? 
Well, we'd buy a lot fewer 
games this Christmas, that's for sure. Yup, 
from <I><a href="chasehq.htm">Chase HQ</a></I> to <I><a href="powerdrift.htm">Power Drift</a></I> to <I><a href="continentalcircus.htm">Continental 
Circus</a></I>, everyone's gone car bloomin' crazy! </b>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some more serious driving simulations 
bouncing about too. The jury's still out on <I><a href="harddrivin.htm">Hard 
Drivin'</a></I>, but here comes <I>The Duel</I>, Accolade's follow 
up to the mega-successful PC/16 bit driverama <I>Test 
Drive</I>. In fact. It's quite heart warming to see a 
respectable, simulation-based outfit like Accolade 
dipping its toes into the Speccy market this late in 
the day. So it's a real shame I can't bring myself to 
write anything very nice about the results. Because, 
to be honest. <I>Test Drive II</I> smacks a bit of old tosh. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh sure, the blurb promises something a bit 
special. 'Race head to head in the fastest 
production cars ever built!' Wow! A choice between 
a Ferrari F40 and a Porsche 959! Road hazards like 
'oncoming traffic, rocks, loose gravel, pot holes and 
oil slicks.' Hot diggetty-dog! Can't wait, right? 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But oh dear, oh dear. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, let's kick off with the graphics. They're just 
so lifeless! Take the courses. (No, please, take 
them!) In general they're some of the most flat and 
featureless routes I've ever seen, be they desert, 
cliff paths or grasslands, with the very minimum of 
roadside features (outside of the odd cactus). And 
the cars are no better. The dark blue dashboards 
are modelled on the cars in question but, in fact, 
both look far more like the plasticy job from a 
Nissan Sunny or something. And what are the roads 
populated with? Not trucks or Beetles or Corvettes 
or anything else vaguely interesting, but more 
blooming three box saloons! Even when you're 
racing the other supercar the graphic used is just 
that of another Nissan. In short, you'll have to use 
your imagination a bit here! 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thankfully, the control system is considerably 
better. You're given a wide range of skill options 
from easy to really hard, the first four of which use 
an automatic gearbox, with the more difficult ones 
on manual. Actually, there's not much point in 
playing it on auto at all (too little to do) but on 
manual things warm up a bit. In fact, they warm up a 
trifle too much - fail to change up in time and your 
engine explodes! Yikes! But - and it's a very big 
'but' - even at the simplest level your motor is 
damn near uncontrollable. To even stay on the road 
(staying in lane is pretty impossible) takes a million 
tiny corrections. So it's totally unlike 'real life'. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are, however, but petty crimes compared 
to the two main holes in the thing. For a start there 
is no real impression of speed - not even a little 
bit! Unless you've got your eyes pinned to the 
speedometer, it's near impossible to tell how fast 
you're meant to be going. The clock will climb from 
about 15 to 105 mph in seconds and suddenly you'll 
be going too fast to take a corner - though it sure 
doesn't 'feel' like it. Again, totally unlike the 
experience of driving a real car, where you only 
need to check out the speedo occasionally. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then there's the collision detection. It's 
hopeless. You'll crash into a cactus when it looks 
like it's, ooh, a good 20 feet away. Apparently the 
computer judges whether you'd hit it or not within 
the next frame of animation or something and 
freezes you there, which leaves the offending object 
sitting there smugly, miles from your bonnet. How 
frustrating. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that's it really. I keep going back to the game,
thinking it can't be that bad. Maybe I've just been 
unfair. Maybe, once you get into it, after you've got 
used to all the frustrating peculiarities and learned 
just how far from the other cars you need to be, it all 
comes to life and becomes playable. After all, the 16 
bit <I>Test Drive</I> took a bit of getting used to. But I 
doubt it. If you're buying a racing game this 
Christmas there must be at least seven better ways 
to spend your cash.
