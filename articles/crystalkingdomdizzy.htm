<div><b>For the past month, the 
Shed has been the scene 
of many arguments 
concerning little Dizzy. 
Jon's against him, I'm 
slightly for him, Andy couldn't care 
less and various other Future people 
keep popping in and offering us their 
views. It seems that 
everybody has their 
Dizzy opinion 
(except for Andy) 
and I'll be glad 
when this latest 
release is on the 
shelves and no longer the 
Shed's main topic of conversation. 
Honestly, tempers really are getting 
rather frayed at the edges. </b>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the other day Jon 
and Adam (from Amstrad 
Action) got into a tizzy with 
one another and started an 
elastic band fight. This soon escalated into a 
full-scale Dizzy war with other people coming 
along and taking sides. It was awful, Andy and 
I had to hide underneath our desks 'til they ran 
out of 'laccy bands. I'm sorry, but I 
like a quiet Shed! 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cause of all this excitement is 
now safely snuggled up in the Shed 
+3, the programmer travelled 90 
miles just to bring it to us! Yep, 
<i>Crystal Kingdom Dizzy</i> has arrived, 
and I bet you're just dying to know 
what it's like. Well, in away, it's not 
really worth me telling you is it? If 
you hate Dizzy then you're not 
going to believe me if I were to 
tell you how excellent this game 
is. On the other hand, if you're a 
die-hard Dizzy fan you've 
probably already put in an order 
for this one and there's no way you're going to 
take any notice if I should start ranting on 
about how awful the whole Dizzy thing is. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>If it ain't broke...</b><br>
But don't worry, I'm not going to enthuse and 
rm not going to rant. What I am going to try 
and do is work out why this Dizzy game is 
&pound;9.99 whereas all the others 
were &pound;3.99 and whether or not 
it's worth it. The first point to 
get out of the way is that old 
moan that the anti-Dizzy 
contingent always put 
forward - the fact that all the 
arcade-adventure type Dizzy 
games are exactly the 
same. Well, of course 
they are! That's what 
makes them so darn 
popular. Each Dizzy 
game sells more than 
the last one and the 
earlier games are still 
selling by the cartload. 
People like formulae, 
they know exactly 
what they want from 
Dizzy and they 
always get it. The 
Codies have got the 
right idea - if it ain't 
broke, don't fix it. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every Dizzy 
game is exactly the 
same in the way that something like 
Just William books or any school stories are 
the same. You always get the same 
characters, although ocassionally a newcomer 
might appear for a while. The plot is 
always broadly the same, it's the old good 
triumphs over evil story over and over again. 
But so what? Dizzy is a strong character who 
acts in a certain way, he wouldn't really be at 
home in any other kind of game. Dizzy in a 
<i><a href="streetfighterii.htm">Street Fighter 2</a></i> scenario would be as 
ridiculous as Bob Monkhouse as the new Dr 
Who. Dizzy games are all written along the 
same lines for a reason, not out of laziness. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>The same old story</b><br>
Like all Dizzy games, this one's got a nice little 
storyline. Everybody in Dizzyland is happily 
enjoying a nice sunny day. Everybody that is 
apart from Grand Dizzy, he knows that the 
treasures of the Prophet Zeffar have been 
stolen from the Ice Palace and that soon, 
according to some ancient scrolls, a curse will 
fall upon the land. It's obviously up to Dizzy to 
wander across the land solving 
puzzles, somersaulting over 
nasties, using objects, 
picking up points and 
collecting some 
important treasures. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dizzy's main objective 
is to return old Zeffar's 
sacred objects to their shrine 
in the 
Ice Palace. It's 
true, <i>Crystal 
Kingdom Dizzy</i> 
does look and 
play exactly like 
every other 
Dizzy game, 
but I don't mind 
that. I like the 
way Dizzy 
moves and 
somersaults 
and I like the 
way I can 
never solve the puzzles - it's a 
solid and dependable part 
of my life! But most of all, I 
love the way that Dizzy 
fans so obviously enjoy 
these games. I love the 
maps they draw and the 
tips they send in. In fact, I 
think that I could have easily been 
a Dizzy fan myself. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>But!</b><br>
What I don't like is the price tag. This game 
isn't radically, or even slightly, different to any 
of the previous Dizzy games. Dizzy fans are 
going to buy this one, but it's going to cost 
them six quid more than usual and boost 
CodeMasters' profits. <i>Crystal Kingdom Dizzy</i>
would have been a mid-eighties score, but that 
price tag really does knock the score down. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><center><b>DIZZY - THE DEBATE</b></center><p>
<b>Taking part are Adam Peters, staff writer 
on Amstrad Action, and our very own Jon 
Pillar. </b>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>JP</b> Why is Dizzy an egg? 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>AP</b> But I know why he's an egg. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>JP</b> Why? 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>AP</b> I'm not telling you. I know the answer so 
I'm going to win the argument. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>JP</b> Tell me! 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>AP</b> Not 'til we start the argument. 
<i>(You already have! Ed)</i>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>JP</b> Why is Dizzy an egg? Of all the things in 
the world why did they go for an egg? Why 
not a courgette, or a stick of celery, or a fluffy 
animal? 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>AP</b> But they don't do somersaults, that's why 
Dizzy's so appealing. According to David 
Darling, one of the main reasons for Dizzy's 
success is the fact that he can turn 
somersaults. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>JP</b> Monty Mole somersaulted. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>AP</b> Ah, but that was a mole. There hadn't 
ever been a somersaulting egg. The Codies 
wanted a character so Philip Oliver drew a 
nice big face, then the face 
needed to move so they gave it 
arms and legs. Philip Oliver 
admitted that he's not a very 
good graphic designer, so all he 
could come up with was a big 
face that mutated into an egg. 
And what's wrong with eggs? 
They don't hurt anyone. But I'm 
not sure whether or not he's 
officially an egg. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>JP</b> The Codies call him an egg, 
and certain sad people keep 
making crap egg jokes. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>AP</b> Eggsactly! 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>JP</b> I can't believe you 
said that. Anyway, that's 
why he's an egg is it? 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>AP</b> Yep, and I don't think 
there anything wrong with 
having an heroic egg. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>JP</b> So why are the games crap then? 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>AP</b> They're not, the kids like 'em and buy 
'em, so they can't be. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>JP</b> They like 'em cos they fluffy and 
innocuous, like some pop songs. The fact 
that they're best-sellers doesn't mean they're 
any good at all. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>AP</b> But people aren't going to buy games 
which they think are crap. You might think 
they're crap but the people who are buying 
them obviously don't. You're just taking the 
high intellectual ground. Dizzy games are 
among the best games coming out at the 
minute. And they make money. We are living 
in a material world. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>JP</b> But when the Codies put some thought 
into things, they can come up with something 
like <i><a href="steg.htm">Steg</a></i>. Dizzy is just an 
easy way out. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>AP</b> Did you know that Andy 
can knock cups off people 
heads with elastic bands? 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>JP</b> Can he? If we put this 
plastic cup on Linda's 
head, will he be able to hit 
it from over there? 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>AP</b> Well yeah, but 
shouldn't you finish 
drinking the tea first? 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>JP</b> No of course not, 
that'd take half the fun 
out of it.
