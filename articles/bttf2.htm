<div><b><i>Back To The Future II</i>, 
eh? You can hardly hve
missed it, can you? The 
computer game's been fairly 
high profile too - we had JD's 
Megapreview a few issues back, and now 
it's on the cover, there's a review in the 
mag (and you're reading it) and blow me 
down if there s not a mega-demo on this 
month's Smash Tape too! (In fact, at this 
rate you probably know more about the
game than I do, which is a bit of a bummer 
'cos I'm the one who's meant to be writing 
this pesky thing!) Oh well, on with 
the show. </b>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Film tie-ins, eh? Not an easy thing to do, I can 
tell you - especially with a film as complicated as 
<i>Futsie II</i>. Y'see. The movie kept jumping about time 
and space so much it was hard to come up with 
any one sequence to represent it. There was only 
one thing to do - take the "let's get lots of different 
sections from the film and cobble them together 
into a large (multiload) jobbie instead" approach. 
And has it worked? Well, hold your horses - I'll tell 
you in a minute. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's a huge plot behind this, which is kind of 
important if you want to know what you're doing 
(and why), but a bit boring (and impossible to 
explain) if you don't. So I'm not going to bother - if 
you want to find out then rent the film (it's just 
come out on video) or check out the Megapreview 
in YS 54. Sufficient to say, it all involves you (as 
Marty McFly) and your pal the Doc flipping 
backwards and forwards in time, trying to sort out 
the massive mess that your time-travelling antics 
have inadvertently caused in the lives of both your 
parents and their pals (in the past) and your 
children (and their pals) in the future. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what do you get? Well, first up there's a 
neat little animated graphic of the flying De Lorean 
whizzing about the screen, and then we're straight 
into the first game sequence, the flying skateboard 
chase. The screen scrolls nice and smoothly (but 
not particularly quickly) from left to right (and 
diagonally as well at times) as you bomb about on 
your futuristic deck, dodging bully Griff and his 
mob and trying to knock them off their boards. I'm 
not going to describe it to you any further - check 
it out for yourselves on the front cover demo. 
Suffice to say, it all plays quite smoothly, and has a 
natty little animated sequence where Griff and his 
posse crash into the Town Hall at the end as well. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level Two's a sort of bonus round. Jennifer 
(your girlie) has fainted and been found by the 
police and taken back to her house. Only one 
problem - she's already there. (Confused? You will 
be.) You have to stop Jennifer from meeting her 
future self you see, or any of the other three 
people who share the house, which would make an 
even bigger old pig's ear of things than they 
already are. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You take a bird's-eye view of the proceedings in 
this level, with the two Jennifers and the other 
occupants all wandering from random positions 
around the house. Your task is to guide the old 
Jennifer out without her meeting anyone else (if 
she does you fail) by simply opening and closing 
doors to direct everyone where you want them. All 
this boils down to is a simple little puzzle - loadsa 
colour, and a cheery little break between levels. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blimey. Level 
Three already, 
and Marty and 
the Doc reckon 
they've sorted 
everything out, 
so off they trot 
back to good old 
1985. Now here's the 
clever bit - listening 
carefully? (We'll be asking 
questions later.) Whilst Marty was busy 
trying to rescue Jennifer, Biff (Marty's Dad's
rival, and Griff's grandad) 'borrowed' the 
time-travelling De Lorean from 2015, to 
take an almanac (a sort of diary jobby 
with lots of interesting things in) back to himself in 
1955, thus enabling him to 'predict' the future and 
become vastly rich 'cos he can tell what's going to 
happen. Cunning, eh? So when Marty arrives in   
1985 he finds it all quite different. For example, he 
no longer lives in the same house, Biff rules the 
town, is married to Marty's Mum, and everyone 
else is really rather horrible. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marty's got to get the almanac from Biff (so he 
won't be able to see into the future anymore) by 
simply duffing up everyone in sight, and 
eventually Biff himself. Yes, it's a beat-'em-up. You 
can kick and punch as things scroll from left to 
right, and pick up sticks and things to try and 
disarm the baddies with (though you can't use 
their guns). I thought there was a bit of a lack of 
fighting moves here (apparently 'cos Marty isn't a fighting sort of a chap) and 
it's all a bit on the hard side, but its colourful enough I suppose. Still,
<i><a href="renegade.htm">Renegade</a></i> it ain't. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More plot now I'm afraid, and this bits even more confusing that the last. 
Marty decides he can't stand it any longer, so he reckons it's time to cash in 
his chips by jumping off the roof of Biff's casino. Luckily, the Doc clambers 
into the time-travelling car just in time, zooms up and Marty falls into it 
instead. (What a lucky chap he is.) Anyway, they decide the best thing to do 
is to go back to 1955 to stop Biff giving himself the almanac. So (hopefully) 
everything will get back to normal. Eventually everyone ends up in the 
'Enchantment Under The Sea' Ball, where Marty watches himself playing the 
guitar to get his parents back together (a scene from the first film). 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now ihurrah!) we get one of my fave bits from the game. Remember 
those little games where you had to slide squares around to make a picture? 
Hours of fun. And this is exactly what we've got here. You have to re-assemble this pic of the band who are playing on-stage. The whole things 
animated so prepare to be confused further (if that's possible), whilst a 
beepy rendition of everyone's fave, <i>Johnny B Goode</i>, clinks away in the 
background. Yep, it's fun. Fun, fun all the way.

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finish this bonus bit and it's onto another hoverboard chase, much in the 
same vein as the first although everything looks a bit different seeing as it's 
1955 this time. Reach the end of the level, and there's a great bit where Biff 
gets covered in vast amounts of horse manure. Ha! 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that's the game (in theory anyway). But what do I reckon? Well, firstly, 
it's a multiload affair (six on the 48, three on 128). No, no, calm down. I mean, 
what else could they have done? If they'd cut down each level to make it fit 
in one load everything'd be crap for sure. And if they'd concentrated mainly 
on the one hoverboard level everybody would've complained about that 
too. So let's not make a meal of it, eh? (Although I must admit it's bloody 
annoying waiting all day for each level to load.)

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the actual game itself, well. It's good fun and quite varied, and I 
like the way the whole thing sort of hangs together. It's a bit of a shame 
that you can't practice each level individually though, 'cos some of 
us may never get on to the later ones and are bound to get a tad 
bored with the first hoverboard bit after a while. But never 
mind, I still like it. It's playable, it's fun, it's addictive. What 
more is there to say? If this sort of thing's your bag, and if 
you like the film, then you 
can't really go wrong. (But 
whatever you do, don't go 
away thinking that's the last 
you'll be hearing on the <i><a href="backtothefuture.htm">Back To The 
Future</a></i>
front,
oh, ho 
no. 
Theres the  
video and then 
the final installment
of the movie to 
come - and the 
game of the 
third film to 
boot, as the 
naff plug at 
the end of
the game 
'gently' 
reminds
us. Ho 
hum.)
