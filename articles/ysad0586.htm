Right, to begin let me say that these are going to be some of the best adventure pages around, so keep reading 'em. And just so you know, I'll be dealing only with straight-forward text and text'n'graphics adventures, with maybe some variations like <I><a href="adventuregreats.htm">The Fourth Protocol</a></I> allowed to creep in. But, arcade adventures will be dealt with elsewhere in the mag. Okay the odd one might sneak in when I'm not looking, but if I come across that Wally Week in these pages I'll throw him out at once. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you're writing in and want a personal answer to a problem, then enclose a stamped addressed envelope. If you don't then I'll assume you're happy for me to deal with your problem in these pages. Mind you, just because you enclose an sae it doesn't mean you won't be seeing your name here. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Address your letters to me at <I>Your Sinclair</I>. And remember, if you've got a query for a different department, you'll have to go wild and splash out 12p on another stamp otherwise it's likely to get lost among the old axes and dead dwarves that lie around my desk. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Always try to ask a specific question, too. How not to do it is shown by <b>Darren Clark</b>, of Whitehaven, Cumbria. "How do you finish <I>Spiderman?</I>" Darren asks. Well, it depends how far you've got, Darren. Do you mean right from the start, from about half-way through, or just the last few problems? Anyway, for help on that, <I>The Hulk</I>, and just about any adventure you care to name, contact <b>James Elliott</b>, Alloa. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example of how not to do it is from <b>M.N. Andrews</b>, of Yeovil, Somerset, who says he or she is pulling out his or her hair trying to get past the Guardians of the Gates. Fine, but it'd make things just a touch easier if you told us the name of the adventure. We don't want people pointing at baldies in the street and saying "They must read <I>Your Sinclair</I>," do we? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now on to this 'El Supremo' business. So many readers have completed so many adventures that I think instead I'll start a 'Big-Head of the Month' award, so just watch it. What I would like, though, is to hear from anyone who thinks they might be the first to finish an adventure. Write in if you reckon you have a claim to fame like that. You never know, we may even feature your ugly mug in these pages. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's no doubt in my mind, though, that the 'El Supremo' title has to go to <b>John Wilson</b> of Rochdale, who's first in with completed solutions. And his right to the title is even supported by other readers who acknowledge his help. John himself hardly ever seems to need a clue of any kind. I hereby declare him the Rochdale Balrog. <I>(Let's hope it's not catching. Ed)</I>. We'll find out how he does it in a future issue. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, a few tips to show that adventures are capable of POKEing a program as well as the next person. <b>Jim Grimwood</b> of London found you can break into Level 9's <I><a href="jewelsofdarkness.htm">Dungeon Adventure</a></I> if you get stuck in the tower. It's at this point that there's a bug in the routine that keeps track of the objects you're carrying. If you have too many you can press BREAK, POKE 26490 with the number of objects you were carrying, GOTO 100 and then get out of the exit door. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Adrian Shaw</b> of Plymouth has been tinker- ing around in the <I>Oracle's Cave</I>, and found that you can press the down arrow key to get into the program, then change the value oft in line 3002 to alter the number of days you have in which to complete your task. Increase it to 36000 to give you 50 days, for example, or down to below 3600 to start making the game tougher. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most adventures are quite hard enough as it is, and <b>Andrew Smith</b> of Fakenham, Norfolk, is finding that he Karn't do <I>Heroes Of Karn</I>, because he's having trouble finding Khadim and also according to him, because he can't open the pearl. I think you mean the clam, Andrew, in which maybe you hope to find a pearl. You can't get into that till quite late on in the adventure. And as you might've expected you'll need a tool of some kind to prise it open: RABWORC A EKIL. As you see, I'll be printing the occasional solution backwards, in case some people are trying to figure out that particular problem for themselves. Though don't be like a reader (on another magazine, of course) who wrote to ask me if that meant the answer had to be typed into the adventure backwards if it didn't work the right way round. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you know that there was a text-only version of <I><a href="tolkientrilogy.htm">The Hobbit</a></I>? I didn't, till several readers wrote in to point out that if you choose 'N' as the key to press to remove the loading screen and start the game proper, the graphics don't appear. It works - try it. I think the star of that adventure should be nicknamed Bilbo Buggins, because of the numbers of bugs in the program. The latest to come my way is from <b>Ian Ormesher</b> of Bootle, who says that in the original version 1.1 of the game it was impossible to kill the dragon. That's because you couldn't go east from the town in the middle of the Long Lake. That's because you couldn't go east from the town in the middle of the Long Lake. This has been corrected in version 1.2, mind. It sounds like it was a slight fault in the routine where you must ask Elrond to read the map for you, and the route he tells you about is only actually filled in on the map at that point. If you don't have him read the map to you then the route won't exist. The way to spot the difference between the versions is that the names of the programmers have been added on the loading screen for 1.2. Have any other readers found this problem? My version is the second one, so I can't check it out. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm sure we'll soon be encountering more and more bugs on <I><a href="lordoftherings.htm">Lord Of The Rings</a></I> in the months to come. The most obvious one is in the first location, if you try to <I>SEARCH DESK</I>. See the response you get to that! Any more from you little bug... erm, you little bug-hunters out there? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the problems in Melbourne House's latest is getting through the maze in the <I>Mines of Moria</I>. A reader from Christchurch in Dorset with the almost perfect adventurer's name of <b>Richard Grandorge</b> got himself lost at this point. I won't print the route through the mines backwards, as you might find yourself even more lost than you were to start with. So, if you don't want to know, don't read that it's UP, EAST, EAST, EAST, DOWN, DOWN, WEST, WEST, WEST, DOWN - you should then find yourself in a corridor. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard and others have also had trouble with the barrow-wight. It seems that violence only meets with violence. A peaceful approach won't get you anywhere, so: ELBISIVNI EMOCEB DNA GNIR RAEW. Another common problem is asked by <b>Tim Chamberlain</b> of Leicester, and that's "Can you kill the Black Riders?" No, cowardice is the answer, but you've got to know which way to go to avoid them. If they arrive, the general rule is HTUOS RO HTRON OG YLNO. And now if you'll excuse me, I'm going west till the next issue.
