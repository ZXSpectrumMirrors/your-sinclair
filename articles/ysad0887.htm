Now listen here, you lot, there are about six trillion of you writing to me every month so I reckon its time for a recap as to the odds on you getting a reply or appearing in print. If you enclose an sae you'll certainly get a reply, you have my word as a gentleman and a fellow-adventurer, so if you ever write with an sae and don't hear back from me it means your letter's probably gone astray in the post so write again. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don't enclose an sae then you won't get a reply, simple as that. Why so mean? Well, the Ed was stopping the stamps out of my wages, and if you work out the cost of six trillion stamps every month you'll realise this is Not A Good Idea, at least not as far as I'm concerned! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if you don't enclose an sae then I'll do my best to answer your questions in the mag, but there are more letters coming in than room so I can't promise anything. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course anyone who wins the coveted Manuel-of-the-Month Award automatically gets a mention, and this time it's <b>Ken Haley</b> of Sunderland who says he got his Spectrum about six months ago, has at the last count bought 26 adventures, and is stuck in every one of them. Well done that man. A few clues to help you out? Well, I don't want to spoil your record... oh alright, just a few. In <I>Zzzzz</I> you're stuck with the orchestra waiting for a signal so NOTAB ESIAR. Ken says there surely must be more than six locations in <I><a href="adventuregreats.htm">Adventureland</a></I>. There surely are, and you'll find them if you type in things other than single compass directions. Try CLIMB TREE first, then later CHOP TREE with your rusty but trusty axe. How to stop dying of exhaustion in <I>Matt Lucas</I>? Well, what would you do? That's right, SLEEP. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ian Sealy</b> of Rugby offers the following sequence of commands to solve the beginners adventure in <I><a href="lordoftherings.htm">Lord Of The Rings</a></I> in seven moves - HEY, E, E, E, WEAR RING, E, TAKE OFF RING. Ian also says that he knows the <I>Fourth Protocol</I> is one of my blindspots (it's a fair cop), so he offers a few clues to get you (or me) going in part one. "The code is needed for entry to Blenheim and Blenheim's number is found under a file called Telephone. Watch Abbs and TURN STANISTAV. Cross reference names on documents. Watch Faulkner, Sopwith and Allen. File on Faulkner is available. Ring car phone, search flat, arrest Allen and transfer him." I've reprinted that as quite a few people have got my blindspot too and they've asked me how to get started in that one. Thanks, Ian. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Paul Drysdale</b> of Dalbeattie has an interesting disease, or so he tells me. It's called <I>Seabase Delta</I>itis and the symptoms are that you can't stop playing that Firebird adventure. The cure is how to make a pancake, what use is it if you do make it, and how do you get past the TV camera? If you've got the bowl, milk, egg and flour then you can MAKE PANCAKE, and don't forget at some point to TOSS PANCAKE. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Philip Hancock</b> of East Ham reckons I should restrain myself. So I've been told, Philip, but let's stick to the subject of adventures. Philip's complaint is that I've recently printed a few solutions to newish games, like <I><a href="dracula.htm">Dracula</a></I> and <I><a href="colourofmagic.htm">The Colour Of Magic</a></I>, and he says if you've had to wait a while to buy the game, then see a solution in print almost at once, it's hard to resist the temptation to look at it when you're struggling over some problem. Other people also see the solutions, play through them and then boast about solving the adventures themselves. Not fair, says Philip. He thinks I should wait at least a year before printing a full solution, and meanwhile concentrate on giving solutions to the really tough problems, like the recent map of the Goblins' Dungeon did. Others to try in that line would be the start of <I>The Fantastic Four</I> and the end game in <I>Final Mission</I>. I think there's a lot of sense in what Philip says, and would welcome other readers' thoughts - also suggestions for Really Tough Problems that you might like to see featured. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>David Mcintyre</b> of Sheffield says he's having a competition to find the worst recently-released adventure. Semi-finalists at the moment are <I>Necris Dome</I> and <I><a href="mastersoftheuniverse.htm">Masters Of The Universe</a></I>, and David says the latter's so bad it doesn't even accept some of the words the documentation tells you to use! He also says <I>Necris Dome</I> is so boring that it's almost unplayable. Strong words - anyone violently agree or disagree? Or want to suggest other contenders? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Stephen Salter</b> of Ipswich just wants to know the right words to board the train in <I>The Shrewsbury Key</I>. That could be another idea for a regular section - Awkward Inputs. In this case the answer is CLIMB INTO TRAIN. Anytime I come across something that I think is a faulty parser rather than a faulty player, I won't bother to print it backwards. And no doubt my resident critics like David Mcintyre and Philip Hancock will complain about that now. You just can't win. Who'd be an adventure writer, eh? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another letter from an Ipswich direction comes from <b>Ben Wythe</b> of Willow Farm. When Ben's not farming willows he's getting stuck in adventures like <I>Spy Trek Adventure</I> and <I>1942 Mission</I>. In the first Ben asks what use the pound coins are: TROPRIA TA PMART OT EVIG. In the second, what's the safe combination: RALLOC DAER/SEGAP NRUT/KOOB DAER. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Matthew McConkey</b> of McBinningham wants help on <I><a href="kayleth.htm">Kayleth</a></I>. What to do with the compost? Well, going S/S/E from 'Near the entrance to an elevator' you should TSOPMOC OTNO RETAW RUOP then TSOPMOC NI BLUB TNALP and TIAW till it SMOOLB and forms SDEES. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next a letter written by three people - now that's clever. The three are all from Saltash and go by the impressive names of <b>Paul and David van Beveren and Aaron Dadds</b>. Many thanks to this dynamic... no,, sorry, that's a duo, isn't it? Er, thanks to this trifflc trio for their solution to <I>Seabase Delta</I> and the five names needed to complete the final part of <I><a href="mindshadow.htm">Mindshadow</a></I>, which are MAILLIW/DERAJ/SRETSAM BOB/NAMCRA/NOOCYT. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Bill Campbell</b> writes from Dublin with a question: "Am I the first to complete <I>Microman</I> and <I>The Mural</I>?" The answer to which is, not by a long chalk. Sorry, Bill, but solutions to these two reached me from <b>John Wilson</b> almost before the games had stopped loading. Thanks for the solutions anyway, and I always welcome these to add to my files. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thorny letter from <b>Russ Graham</b>, who doesn't give his address but asks lots of questions about submitting adventures. Do Level 9 and Mosaic accept games sent in to them? Well, Mosaic is in the business of planning and packaging adventures based on existing books, so it wouldn't be interested in an adventure of your own, and Level 9 has only ever published one game from an outside author, <I>Emerald Isle</I>, so I think chances are so high against you as to be out of sight. Stick to trying the budget companies. Would Ocean accept your adventure? Again, based on what it's published so far your game would have to be mega-brilliant to stand a chance of Ocean looking at it. Would you have to write a novella to go with it? No you wouldn't. And a totally different question from Russ to end with - which is correct, <I><a href="sweevosworld.htm">Sweevo's World</a></I> or <I>Sweevo's Whirled</I>? They both are, Russ, depending on whether you've got a 48K or 128K version. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A similar question to some of those comes from <b>Robert Shaw</b> of Rosshire, who says that he's hoping to write an adventure based on the film <I>Terminator</I>, but wonders what permission he needs as regards copyright. You don't actually need any permission simply to write the game for your own amusement, but as soon as you think about selling it to anyone, or even giving a copy to a friend, then you need permission from the copyright owners. In this case it would probably be the film's distributors, Orion Pictures, and you should write to them to ask who owns the computer game rights. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert also has some more straightforward questions, such as how to get anywhere on the boat in <I>Matt Lucas</I>. If you've filled it with petrol, got the ignition key and read the map, you should then head S/S/E/E/S/S/W/S/W/ S/S. And what about the elixir of life in <I>Imagination</I>? First fire the gun in the tank in game 4. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phew, no more space. See you next month.
