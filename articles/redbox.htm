<div>Remember the 
early days of the 
micro revolution? 
We were all going 
to get up to wizard 
wheezes like 
running our train sets with our 
ZX81's? But computer control 
was never that simple, and in 
the end it attracted only those 
most hardened of hobbyists - 
the trainspotters. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, maybe Sir Clive's early 
advertising claims that the 
good old '81 was powerful 
enough to run a nuclear power 
station were a little OTT. But it's 
still true that a Spectrum can 
be used for more than playing 
games, and that's the thinking 
behind Red Box. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Few peripherals are so aptly 
named as this one. The starter 
pack consists of not one but 
three boxes and all of them are 
undoubtedly very, very red. 
They are also very, very plain. 
No unpleasant edge 
connectors or difficult dials. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's the secret of the Red 
Box system. You plug in 
whatever you want to control 
just as if you were connecting it 
to an extension lead. And, 
even more cleverly, it uses the 
mains to connect units in a 
network. They sit there, happily 
talking to each other and using 
minimal electricity, without any 
clumsy, trailing cables. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow, you're saying - this is 
just what I need to run that 
nuclear power station in the 
basement from the safety of 
my bedroom. Well, this is how 
you do it. First, follow the 
instructions carefully, as they 
take you through the early 
stages slowly and clearly. 
Here's the basic process: 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set up your Speccy as if you 
were about to Load a tape, but 
with the Ear socket connected 
to Red Leader rather than a
cassette recorder. Then switch 
on the command unit and it'll 
automatically download a 
control program. You can then 
plug in other units, and 
introduce Red Leader to them. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each unit, whatever its type, 
has a unique code, and though 
you'll probably find it easier to 
refer to them by a short name, 
the control chip uses this ID to 
send commands. Note: if 
you're worried about hackers 
breaking into your system via a 
shared circuit, don't be. Red 
Box uses a complex encryption 
system to prevent intrusion. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once every unit knows the 
others' names and is happily 
hand shaking, you can start to 
have some fun. Plug a light into 
a Red One socket and you 
can turn it on and off from the 
main menu.

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eventually, after about 
ooh... ten seconds or so, you'll 
get tired of strobing your 
anglepoise and want to get 
down to something more 
ambitious. How about getting
Red Leader to turn the light on
at midnight, then off again five 
minutes later? It's simplicity 
itself, you just enter the 
relevant twenty-four hour times 
and then set the command in 
motion. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What next? How about a bit 
of fun with Red Two. You can 
slave units, so that they won't 
switch until they get a signal 
though the mains. You can use 
the infra-red sensor to turn on 
the lamp, though sadly it won't 
turn it off again. All you have to 
do is wave your hand in front of 
Red Two and, lo... let there be 
light! 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now you're beginning to get
an idea of the god-like potential 
of the system, and there's no 
need to stop with the starter 
pack. You can connect a 
infinite number of units to one 
ring main - in theory at any 
rate. To make the most of all 
that command power though, 
you'll need to take the next 
step, into Red Box Basic.

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, I admit, this is where it 
gets just a tiny bit technical, 
and unluckily the manual isn't 
quite so helpful for novices at 
this point. But when Red 
Leader down-loads the 
command program, it also 
gives you a new dialect of the 
language you already know 
and love (or hate, or ignore, for 
that matter). 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It adds a number of 
commands that are missing 
from Spectrum Basic, such as 
programming aids like Delete, 
plus conditionals like 
Repeat... Until and even 
commands dedicated to the 
system, such as Install. These 
let you write quite complex 
chains of commands, so that 
you can not only turn on your 
nuclear power plant, but also 
switch on the kettle to boil a 
cup of tea. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether you get into proper 
programming, or settle for 
slavery by single key 
commands, once you've sorted 
out a satisfactory sequence 
you can tell Red Leader that 
you're satisfied, then unplug 
your Spectrum. So long as the 
big red one remains plugged 
in, its own little on-board micro 
will carry on doing just what 
you asked it. And as each Red 
unit contains a micro too, you 
can unplug them and move 
them around and the Leader 
will still keep in touch. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By now you should be 
thinking about how you can 
use the system, and if you're 
lacking ideas, there are a few 
below. But the real future of 
Red Box lies in... the future! 
You see, GIS has lots of 
exciting expansion plans on the 
cards. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For starters there's a real 
time clock with battery back up 
for Red Leader, which means 
that even if there's a power cut 
it'll know exactly what to do 
and when. There will also be 
other sensors, and most 
excitingly, work is underway on 
an autodialler for use with your 
phone. Imagine being able to 
set a sensor at home, so that if 
it detects an intruder, it phones 
somebody and warns them 
with a pre-recorded message! 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The uses of Red Box are 
really only limited by your 
imagination. From remote 
control of a trainset to 
switching on the fire to the 
creation of a security system, 
Red Box can do it. The only 
real restriction is that it's not 
suitable for extremely high 
power devices, such as 
immersion heaters or cookers. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from that though, it's 
extremely easy to use, so what 
are you waiting for? Now 
there's no excuse not to join 
the Red (Box) Revolution and 
take control! 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>THE STORY OF THREE LITTLE TRAINSPOTTERS</b><br>
Once upon a time there were Three Little Trainspotters, who were afraid that the big bad Wolf would break in while they were out trainspotting. So the First Little Trainspotter set up a security system with Read leader turning on a light at eight o'clock then turning it off and replacing it with another at nine. It also turned on the radio at eight-thirty. The Wolf thought, "Uh-oh... he's at home!" and moved on.

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trainspotter Two also set up a light and a cassette recording of casual conversation to try and fool the cat... sorry, Wolf burglar. But being a more cautious sort he set up Red Two just above his front door. When the Wolf huffed and puffed and blew it in, it triggered an alarm, hidden under the roof, which sent the Wolf scarpering before the Three Little Coppers arrived in their panda car!

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the third house the Wolf didn't notice a Red Two commanding a heater under the goldfish bowl. The water boiled after four minutes, then out jumped the fish, on to the model train, which was programmed to start a minute later. It passed the cat, which ran after it, triggering another Red Two which started the drill. The Wolf struggled with the door, held shut by a giant electro-magnet. But when the anvil fell, a third Red Two switched the magnet off. As the Wolf flew the door, he was crushed by the plummeting anvil!
