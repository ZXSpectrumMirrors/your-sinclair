Before I begin, it's time to use the OOPS command again and correct something from an earlier issue. Correct two somethings in fact. Not that either of them is my fault. I mean, is it my fault that <b>Paul Brunyee</b> goes and moves before the review of his game <I><a href="onedarknight.htm">One Dark Night</a></I> appears in print? No, course not. But just for the record, in case you're a slow reader and haven't yet got round to the review in the December issue, when you come to send in your order send it to Paul's new address in Leicester. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second oops ain't my fault either, it's that Scottish scoundrel's <b>Tom Frost</b>, who's obviously been at the drinks cabinet again. The definitive shortest solution to his game <I><a href="doubleagent.htm">Double Agent</a></I> that he sent me for printing in the magazine turns out to be not quite the definitive shortest solution after all. He only took it out of the wrong folder, and sent me a solution to a pre-release version. McPlonker! So now he's sent me what he assures me is quite definitely and without doubt positively and most assuredly the shortest solution to <I><a href="doubleagent.htm">Double Agent</a></I> that exists. Maybe. This one is in 139 moves, and if you're interested in seeing a copy then send your sae's to yours truly as I've added it to my list of freebies. And now, on with the main event. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How's this for starters? Reader <b>Stuart Lord</b> recently sent me his new address, saying he'd moved in order to start a new job with the Ministry of Defence in darkest Buckinghamshire. He can't say more than that for security reasons, but he reassures me that their computer system doesn't have any adventure games on it. I'm relieved to hear it. Quite a few games have a DROP BOMB input, and we wouldn't want it taken the wrong way, would we? And can you imagine playing <I><a href="tolkientrilogy.htm">The Hobbit</a></I>? One bug and you could have the entire RAF on red alert. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's quickly get on to more mundane matters, and the question of keyboard overlays. Several readers have recently bought <I><a href="ystop100_4.htm">Lords Of Midnight</a></I> either second-hand or on a compilation tape, with the result that they're missing the keyboard overlay that came with the original version. The latest such overlay-less person is Simon Johnson, Kingswood, Bristol. Not that the object itself would do him much good as Simon's got a +3 and the overlay was only designed for ye olde rubber keyboard Spectrums, so can anyone tell him which keys do what? Come to that, can anyone tell me and I'll make the info available as a freebie as it's something that crops up quite often. Me and my copy of the game parted company a long time ago. Sigh. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blizzard problems now, <I>Blizzard Pass</I>. Solutions supremo <b>Jim Magee</b> of Glasgow recently bought a second-hand copy of that adventure, but it looks like there's a fault on the tape. Or has anyone else got a version where, once the game has loaded, it doesn't matter what you type in at the start as it always replies, "No understandable words in that input." Any suggestions for solving the problem, other than returning the tape? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My thanks to <b>Stewart Heatley</b> of Andover for writing out a full solution to the game for me, and I didn't even hand over a badge to him for his efforts. (Andover, geddit?) Besides, I've told you before that they don't trust me with valuable objects like YS badges. But thanks anyway, Stewart. Hope your Speccy's better now. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also in solution-sending mood was <b>David Jaundrell</b> from Penketh, who wrote out the solution to <I><a href="mindshadow.htm">Mindshadow</a></I> for me. What a kind chap. In return he'd like to know the code word for <I><a href="savageisland.htm">Savage Island</a></I> II. But of course, me old chip butty, it's 321 YAS. Hardly worth writing backwards, was it? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mark Kingston</b> accuses me of libelling him last time he wrote, when he "stated that the academic year had just ended, giving rise to complaints of how easy student's life was from a certain inhabitant of Castle Rathbone!" (Puts on Derek Jameson voice). Dush 'e mean me? Perish the thought. The thought of Derek Jameson, that is. Anyway, Mark says he does six months of studying and six months working in industry every year, so no lengthy summer hols for him. Sob-sob. During what few spare seconds he has, Mark's gone and got himself stuck in the ventilation shaft in part two of <I><a href="rigelsrevenge.htm">Rigel's Revenge</a></I> and keeps getting killed. Help! Right, once in the shaft you HTRON LWARC till you reach the junction, then TSEW to the end of the east-west shaft. There you GNINEPO ENIMAXE, NUG EKAT and REIDLOS TA NUG ERIF then finally HSEM HSUP. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I think of <b>Darren Sellwood</b> I only think of one thing - <I><a href="corruption.htm">Corruption</a></I>! The corrupt Mr Sellwood is still engrossed in Magnetic Scrolls' last adventure, and sends in some tips and queries in the hope that someone somewhere is going to solve it soon - preferably him. Darren's got as far as finding the following useful objects - share certificate, affidavit, tape, documents, scented letter, key to David's office, stethoscope, operation papers, book of matches, screwdriver, credit card and car key. The screwdriver is found in the TNEMTRAPMOC EVOLG and can be used firstly to WODNIW RAC HSAMS and then to REWARD S'LLIB NEPO. The stethoscope is found in the hospital RAEB EHT NO, and can be used to EFAS S'DIVAD NEPO. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can answer any of the following questions, write to Darren at Harrow, Middlesex where he's currently going corruptly mad. What do you say to your wife in the restaurant? How do you stop your car from blowing up? How do you prevent yourself from being shot by the fraud squad? And do you get to the party, get home, and get anywhere else important... pleeeeeeaaaasssee? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Phil</b> from Eltham Park is stuck in <I>Terrors Of Trantoss</I>, and wants to know how to open the safe. Nope, you don't use the stethoscope from Corrupt, you ELOH OTNI FFATS TRESNI. To get past the sheer rock face you need to know that the splodge in the graphic is in fact a keyhole, believe it or not, and you open it with YEK ENOTS EHT. Phil sends some tips on <I>Wolfman</I> in return, one for each part. In the first part, how to enter the cave TNILF EKIRTS/KCOR NI ELOH TUC/TNILF DNA HSURLLUB TEG. In part two, when trapped in fortress by guards, DAED EB OT DNETERP. In part three, to get through the patchwork of flowers requires good mapping, but first be sure to SREWOLF KCIP and in each 'square' you should SMETS ENIMAXE as they get higher the further you get. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Vinh Quan</b> from London's trendy N1 says that he can't get the RAM SAVE command to work in <I>The Serfs Tale</I>, which is mentioned on the inlay. The inlay's slightly misleading as you can't use the RAM SAVE command till you've got the Grimoire, but if you hold the Grimoire you can use the command and note that you have to type it backwards. So if I type them backwards as well they come out as RAM SAVE and RAM RESTORE. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next letters a fan letter, from <b>Mrs J. A. Williams</b> of Rugby, but I'll spare my blushes and miss out the wonderful things she says about the YS adventure pages. I'll hardly mention them at all. After agreeing with other readers and saying that the <I>A-Z Of Clues</I> was a great idea (okay, I'll do another one soon promise), Mrs Williams adds "I would like to endorse your view that as adventures are hard to find in the shops these days the best idea is to send off for them. I've done this for quite a while now and have been impressed by the friendliness of all concerned, so could you use your column to give a gold star and a big kiss to the following, Jack Lockerby of River Software, John Wilson of Zenobi, Tom Frost of Tartan and Linda Wright of Marlin, though she may not want the kiss. Please do urge your readers to give the above mentioned a try." Okay, consider yourselves urged, dear readers. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dennis Reily</b> of Northallerton has discovered a few peculiarities in the +3 version of <I>Bard's Tale</I>. First the '?' option isn't available, which should tell you your location and the time of day. Then there's no way to save the entire character menu other than using a Multiface, you have to store them in parties of six at a time. This leads finally to a cheat mode available on the 'Party Merge' option. You can load your party up to 19 times, and by mixing parties, and pooling and trading your goodies, you can multiply your loot 19 times! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a final plea from <b>Kenny Jarman</b> of Bask fanzine fame. Kenny edits the mag and would like to take a stand at a future Microfair, but can't afford the &pound;90 cost on his own. If any other magazine editors are interested in sharing a stand and splitting the cost, contact Kenny at Biggleswade, Bedfordshire.
