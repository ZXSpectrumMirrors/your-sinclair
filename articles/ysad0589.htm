A practical problem to start with, from <b>Shane Baker</b> of Essex, who asks, "With the Save mode that you get on most adventure games, do you save the part of the game you are at onto the actual tape the game is on, and when you reset the computer will it still be on the memory of the game?" Hold it right there, Shane! First of all, NEVER try to save your game onto the tape that the game comes on. Most games won't allow this anyway as the cassette tabs at the back will have been removed to stop you pressing RECORD while the tape is in the machine, but don't even try it. You risk wiping out the original program, then you won't be able to play the game at all. When you have saved your position onto a separate tape, you will still need to load in the original game, then load in your saved position, next time you start to play the game - the data you save doesn't contain all the information to enable you to resume playing, which I think is what Shane was getting at. But while you're playing the game, you can save at any point, and have several different saved positions on your tape - in fact that's the best way of playing as you often find you have to retrace your steps to an earlier part of the game. As for resetting the machine, this wipes out what's in the machines memory, including any RAM SAVE (if the game has such a feature). So don't do it - unless you intend to reload the game from scratch and don't want to save your current position. For the answers to your other questions, Shane, send me a stamped addressed envelope and tell me exactly where you're currently stuck. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tom Williams</b> aged 13 3/4 from Lichfield says he's been stuck on <I>Mountains Of Ket</I> for years. What, a twit! Oops, sorry, I really must stop insulting our wonderful readers. Anyroadup, my advice to young Tom is to ignore the cliff face, and to drop everything if you want to be able to swim in the river. And don't wait two years next time you're stuck. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Simon Hathaway</b> from Plymouth asks about <I>The NeverEnding Story</I>. You should drop the crystal in the room with the ENIHCAM EGNARTS in it, to learn something you'll need later on. Don't kill the torturer - try bribery instead. I don't think the cape serves any useful purpose, but I may be wrong (there's always a first time!) For help on <I>Redhawk</I> you need to contact one of the experts, which counts me out. Try sending your sae and questions to someone like... oh, like Gregory Quinn, Portadown, Co Amargh. And for help on all the other games you mentioned, send your sae to me and tell me where you're stuck. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you're stuck in any of John Wilson's games you can always try typing in various names to see if you get a response. John loves filling up the available memory with messages for friends (and others) to discover. If you've got <I>Behind Closed Doors: The Sequel</I> (and if you haven't, why not??) then try the following: YS, JUNE, EKIM, MANDY, ELISABETH, DOREEN, FRIENDS, TV, RECORDS, LIKES, DISLIKES, KAREN, ZENOBI, TED, SMART EGG. That lot covers everything from Keith Floyd to syrup sponges, although I refuse to be responsible if anyone's offended by some of the cheekier responses! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Robert Beavan</b> from Hereford asks six zillion questions, so here are just a few of the answers. To get to the magic ring in <I><a href="tolkientrilogy.htm">The Hobbit</a></I> you must first escape from the world-famous Goblin's Dungeon and then go SE/E/SE/E. Apologies for not writing that last bit backwards, but it wouldn't have been easy to do! To find the identicard in <I>Rigel</I>, first you ELCIHEV NI STAES ENIMAXE, and then you just STNEMUCOD EHT DAER. In <I><a href="inspectorflukeit.htm">Inspector Flukeit</a></I> to get into the pub you must ENOB PORD. In <I><a href="shadowsofmordor.htm">Shadows Of Mordor</a></I>, as soon as the skinny orc enters you should DROWS HTIW CRO LLIK, and repeat this, and also alternate it with asking Sam to do the same. It also helps if you specify in the input which orc you mean. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking of orcs, remember the sleepy orc in <I>Hammer Of Grimmold</I>? I said you got past it by simply killing it, but some people said that didn't work. It turns out the answer to the problem is different in more recent <I>PAW</I> versions, as opposed to the original <I>Quill</I>. Thanks to <b>Sue Medley</b> for the other solution, which is that first you must examine the orc to get a clue as to one of his little weaknesses, then you CRO RAEN NOGALF ECALP. Go away for about ten moves and then return. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sue also contributes to the great <I><a href="jinxter.htm">Jinxter</a></I> saddle controversy First of all I said that you should ELDDAS TSOP to get it to the station, but some upstart by the name of <b>Denis Reilly</b> claimed you should KCAS EHT NI TI TUP instead and save yourself two-fergs. Sue chips in with the info that Denis's suggestion is easier, but doesn't earn you maximum points. The first method gets you 10 points for doing it, and then you must do a bit of busking for another 10 points, which also gets you a one-ferg ticket for the train so you don't need the two-ferg coin after all. Carrying the saddle KCAS EHT NI doesn't you get the equivalent. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this juncture (you didn't realise we were at a juncture?). I'd like to give a rather belated thanks to everyone who sent me a Christmas card. Better late than never. Thank you, each and every one, except for <b>Greg Quinn</b> who told me to enjoy myself and not drink too much. Make your mind up, Gregsy-baby, it's got to be one or the other! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Karl Camenzulp</b> from East Ham asks where to go once you've got the talking bomb in <I>Rigel</I>. You will have to DLEIFENIM EHT SSORC, and to do that safely you will need ROTCETED EHT - and know how to use it properly. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any <I><a href="swordsandsorcery.htm">Swords And Sorcery</a></I> experts out there? If so, make a note of this name and address, A. O'Brien, Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria. This reader says he recently dug out his copy of this oldie, and after playing it for about an hour he realised why he'd given up on it in the first place: bugs! He's managed to get to Level fours, but can't get to the end of it despite the updated version of the program that he received when he complained at the time. A reasonable complaint, as one of the bugs causes his entire inventory to disappear from time to time! If anyone can help or advise, please contact this poor suffering soul direct. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>C. Gallagher</b> is also a poor suffering soul, but it serves him right because he went and bought <I>Not A Penny More, Not a Penny Less</I>, probably the worst adventure since the dawn of time. C.G. has been, "stuck in the underground for a long time now, so any help anyone can offer would be greatly appreciated" Other suckers... sorry, other sufferers should send their help to him at Rugby, Warwickshire. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Nigel No-name</b> writes all the way from East Doncaster, and before you say that's not a long way this is the one in Victoria, Australia! Among other things, Nigel asks how to save the woman from getting shot in <I>Jack The Ripper</I>. This is one of those fussy-input problems, so is worth repeating for other readers. The input you need is YDAL FO TNORF NI PMUJ. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trouble with an input in another CRL game for <b>Mark Rawe</b> of South Ockendon, and he says he thinks the men in white coats will be taking him away soon if he doesn't sort it out. This is in <I>Wolfman</I>, and Mark's been told he must look in the mirror, but when he types LOOK IN MIRROR he just gets the location redescribed. I don't have a copy of <I>Wolfman</I> to check it out, but it sounds to me like the program's just reading the first two words and responding as if you'd typed in LOOK on its own. Try LOOK MIRROR instead. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>James Handley</b> of Barnes in London must be a quick adventurer. He starts his letter by asking for help on <I>Seabase Delta</I>, then by the time he gets to the P.S. he tells me it's okay 'cos he's finished it! <I>(Or a slow writer! Ed)</I> What he hasn't finished is <I><a href="inspectorflukeit.htm">Inspector Flukeit</a></I>, where he needs to know what to do in the churchyard. First SEVARG EHT ENIMAXE. Then use the YEK LLAMS to unlock the gate. As for the vicar, just give him YRAID EHT and the mucky magazine! And no, I don't mean <I>Your Sinclair</I>, who said that? Kindly leave the page. Oh, we've all got to leave the page anyway because we're at the bottom. Byeeeeee!!!!
