<b> Ha ha. We've changed publishers and are happily nested in Bath. So guess what that means? No interruptions by T'zer, that's what - she's nearly 200 miles away in London, slaving away on <i>ZERO</i>. So I can do exactly as I please without fear of any little remarks being added when I'm not looking. Total power, eh? It's not all it's cracked up to be, you know. Er, actually, on second thoughts, it <i>is</i> all it's cracked up to be. It's brill. Ha ha. Let's go..... </b> <p> <font size=4><b> <i>LAND OF THE GIANTS</i></b></font><br> You may not believe this story, but it's true. It was a dull Sunday morning and there was nothing to do except play on my Speccy. Then I remembered I could play <i><a href="powerdrift.htm">Power Drift</a></i>. Brill, I thought to myself as I chose the fit blonde and the first course. I played for ten minutes, then did my paper-round. When I got back in I watched <i>Land Of The Giants</i> and, just as it was finishing, I remembered I'd left my Speccy on! I rushed upstairs expecting to find the poor thing poaching eggs on its disk drive. Instead I found <i><a href="powerdrift.htm">Power Drift</a></i> still blaring its ace music out. I decided to play. You could imagine my surprise when the other cars didn't move as I set off round the course. I came in to finish my first lap and there they were still parked on the starting grid. I finished the first set and found all four tracks were the same! When I eventually finished the fifth set I expected the high score table to come up, but nope! Instead I went onto an extra lap. And guess what? Instead of being a car I was a motorbike!!! Can you believe it!? Then came the high score table. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Check with Activision if you like but I know what I saw! <br> <b> Rog The Dude <br> Wakefield <br> </b> <br><i> Yes, we know. It was a little 'surprise' bunged in by the programmer - the motorbike in question is the one from </i><a href="superhangon.htm">Super Hang On</a><i> (which was coded by the same bloke, you see). Just to backtrack though - um, you said that you "did your paper-round, got back in and watched "</i>Land Of The Giants<i>". Well, assuming your paper-round starts at seven o'clock and </i>Land Of The Giants<i> starts at one, that means (erm, calculator out) it takes you six hours to complete. SIX HOURS! What on earth do you do? Travel on a sloth or something? Carry on like that and you won't be getting many Christmas bonuses this year. <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> NEARLY A RECORD</b></font><br> For Christmas I got the +3 Action Pack and I have completed <i><a href="operationwolf.htm">Operation Wolf</a></i> using the light gun. To prove it the message at the end says "A successful getaway. You rescued five hostages. Bonus $100,000. You are a real pro." My score was 511,622. Is this a record? <br> <b> Steven Mason <br> Kirkmuirhill <br> </b> <br><i> Bad news, I'm afraid. The actual record score on </i><a href="operationwolf.htm">Operation Wolf</a><i> is 511,623.

I always thought that it was supposed to be <i>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</i>, but the arcade game (and cabinet) shows 'Hero' instead of 'Ninja', and so does the blinking TV series. But if you listen closely to the music on the arcade game it sings "Teenage Mutant <i><a href="ninjamad.htm">Ninja</a></i> Turtles", or at least it sounds more like 'Ninja' than 'Hero'. Was there a mix-up somewhere? Was I wrong from the start and it's always been 'Hero'? Please help. <br> <b> Leigh Loveday <br> Port Talbot, W Glamorgan <br> </b> <br><i> Everybody's wrong. I phoned the bloke who wrote the original coin-op music. Admittedly the samples are a little on the haft side, but what the lyric line is actually saying, if you listen even more carefully, is this - "Teenage Mutant </i>Hedgehog<i> Turtles". Hope I've been of assistance. <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <TABLE align=center BORDER BGCOLOR=white BACKGROUND=""><TR><TD> <FONT SIZE=6><B><U>STAR LETTER</U></b></font><br><font size=4><b> REMARRIED IN KENYA</b></font><br> Firstly I must thank <i>YS</i> for saving my life. Let me explain. I have had a Speccy for almost two years now, and in April last year I had reached the lowest possible moral a mortal can reach. I hear you ask why. Well, down here it's more dry on the software front than the Sahara Desert. New games are very, very hard to come by, and when you do find them they sell at an average of &pound;24. I mean, just imagine a Speccy game at 24 quid!! <i>(Especially a CodeMasters one, eh? Ed)</i> 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, in April I was really tired of playing the same old games over and over again - and I decided to sell my dear old Speccy! I hear you cry out about me being cruel - well, calm down, because as I was passing my newsagent I happened to see... the May issue of <i>YS</i> - with a free badge and tape! I couldn't believe my eyes. Up until then I didn't know that such a mag existed. I rushed into the shop and reserved the one and only copy on the spot. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am now the proud owner of eight copies of <i>YS</i> (so far) all with Smash Tapes. Therefore, <i>YS</i>, I thank you for saving my Speccy and myself from divorce. We are now happily remarried and are on our second honeymoon! Your magazine is not narrow-minded because it covers wide topics, such as The Guide To Doing Things (very valuable). I thank each and every one of you who make <i>YS</i> possible. <br> <b> Shafiq Jamal <br> Nairobi, Kenya <br> </b> PS I am waving your flag in these high seas. Uhua! <br> <br><i> And may you continue to wave it for many years to come. (Uhua!) Um, I'm not generally known for having a kind heart so I'm faced with a dilemma - do I or don't I give you the Star Letter? I was going to until I realised that three games to you means 72 quids' worth or thereabouts. I mean to say - what a windfall. People will start to suspect that I might really be quite nice after all. My image could be destroyed. Oh, I don't know. Erm, okay then, you can have the Star Letter, but never again, alright? (And I'll post them second class.) <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> </td></tr></table><p> <font size=4><b> WORK-SHY</b></font><br> You should have seen what I had to do to get my Spectrum 128. I had to wash windows, wash cars, do babysitting, do a paper-round (and a bit of gardening - and do a milk-round). It took me six months to get &pound;150 but it was worth it, even though I got to school late most of the time. <br> <b> Trevor Clarke <br> Birmingham <br> </b> <br><i> Call that hard work? You don't know you've been born - I work harder than that when I'm asleep. Just wait until you get out into the real world, then you'll discover the meaning of the word 'work'. <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> UPGRADING IN WALMLEY</b></font><br> I am going to be upgrading from a 48K Speccy to the new 256K SAM Coupe. I was wondering if you were going to have a SAM games section in the mag, or a new mag called <i>Your SAM</i>, <i>Your Coupe</i> or even <i>YSC (Your SAM Coupe)</i>. If you are then please tell me. <br> <b> Philip McAllister <br> Walmley, <br> West Midlands <br> </b> <br><i> We're not. BUT we will be telling you which of our reviewed games are compatible. Not this month, but the next. Okay? <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> LONG ENVELOPES</b></font><br> Until now I have not complained about <i>YS</i> at all. But after issue 49 I must point out to you that we don't all use two-metre-long envelopes. It really gets up my nose that month after month you insist on huge names for your compos. <br> <b> Darren Purvis <br> Bridge of Earn, Scotland <br> </b> <br><i> Eh? We always use envelopes of at least two metres' length here at the </i>YS<i> office - that way we can write someone's name, address and post code all on one line. A bit of a timesaver actually. I suggest you pop out and buy some proper ones. There. Problem solved. <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <TABLE align=center BORDER BGCOLOR=cyan BACKGROUND=""><TR><TD> <table align=left><tr><td align=center><IMG src="../thumbs/letters/trainspotter.jpg"><br><font size=5><B>TRAINSPOTTER<br>AWARD</b></font></td></tr></table><font size=4><b> RETURN TO SENNA</b></font><br> Oh dearie me! An unfortunate mistake found. You said in <i>YS</i> 48, page 69, that Ayrton Senna was the Grand Prix World Champion. Fortunately untrue. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He could have won the title if he had won one last Grand Prix of the remaining two of the season, without Alain Prost scoring a point. But, to the joy of people like myself who hate Ayrton Senna (and laugh our heads off every time he goes off the track), he did not score any points at all. He was disqualified from the Japanese Grand Prix after missing out part of the track and being push-started after colliding with Prost (thereby having a reckless driving charge slapped on him and a one-year suspended sentence. Ha ha ha.) He then, in the Australian Grand Prix, crashed into Martin Brundle taking his left front wheel off and therefore making him unable to continue the race! As Prost did not finish the race either (he deliberately went off in the first lap as a protest) <i>(The clot. Ed)</i> Prost became World Champion and not Senna. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long Live Alain Prost, Nigel Mansell, and Yah Boo Sucks to all Ayrton Senna lovers. I rest my case. <br> <b> M Barrett <br> Pontypridd, <br> South Wales <br> </b> <br><i> You're obviously a bit of a buff, aren't you!? But not clever enough, my fine feathered friend! We wrote that Senna was world champion in </i>YS<i> 48 which came out in November 1989. Now then, this was written in the Vox Pop bit where we talked to readers we met at the PC Show. The PC Show took place in late September 1989, but the Australian GP took place in early November! We were therefore quite obviously referring to the 1988 racing season. No trainspotter for you! (Anyway, I quite admire Ayrton Senna's crashing 'tactics'.) <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> THIS WAY UP</b></font><br> I would like to inform you of a mistake that your mag made in the February issue. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mistake is on page 33, about half way down. You state that "pictured below are several of the original characters from the original <i><a href="dandare.htm">Dan Dare</a></i> strip". Wrong. It should have read "pictured <i>above</i> are several of the original characters from the original <i><a href="dandare.htm">Dan Dare</a></i> strip". I therefore claim a Trainspotter Award. <br> <b> James Chivers <br> Horley, <br> Surrey <br> </b> <br><i> I don't know, I don't know. It's a bit of a 'grey' area, this up or down business - after all, everything's relative. (Especially in this case, as </i><a href="dandare.htm">Dan Dare</a><i>'s set in space, where there is no up or down.) Tell you what I'll do - I'll do one of my 'balancing tricks'. I'm going to try to balance the </i>YS<i> microwave oven on top of a vertically-inclined pencil. If it 'stays up' you get a Trainspotter. If it doesn't you don't - here goes. (Lengthy pause followed by 'smash' sound.) Oh dear, the microwave's broken. Sorry, no Trainspotter (and no Lean Cuisine for me this evening.) <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> </td></tr></table><p> <font size=4><b> IT'S A LIMERICK</b></font><br> Here's a limerick from me - 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a man from Tanslair, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who had some cash that was spare, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He must have been mad, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He must have been said <i>(Eh? Ed)</i>, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he never ever bought <i>Your Sinclair</i>. <br> <b> Sajeed Patel <br> Plaistow, London <br> </b> <br><i> There was a young man from Plaistow

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it was totally crap, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just like this one in fact, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so he doesn't really deserve a badge or anything. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Erm, I couldn't think of another word that rhymed with Plaistow, but I'm sure you get my drift - your limerick's crap!) <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> GARBAGE</b></font><br> I recently threw away all the inferior mags that had cluttered up my bedroom over the years out of my room and into rubbish bins, where I torched them all and enjoyed every minute of it. As I stood there I imagined your face - "If the Ed could see me now," I thought, "he'd be proud, smiling at me like a ragi with a chicken curry on the table." So there you have it. The only thing these crappy mags are worth is burning and enjoying the occasion of throwing them out. <br> <b> Neil 'Mr Floyd' Lloyd <br> West Glamorgan <br> </b> <br><i> Bit late doing it though, eh? <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> SPEC ON THE RADAR</b></font><br> I have read with interest those letters describing the multitude of uses to which the humble Speccy lends itself. Here at our secret underground bunker (somewhere in Staffordshire) we use our ZX 81 to analyse NATO-generated nuclear attack/defence scenarios. On alternate Wednesdays and Fridays we interface with the NORAD early warning radar network, ever vigilant for that chunky blip on the TV that could be an incoming missile! Amazing to think that the only problems we ever have are when somebody knocks the book on which the RAM-pack is balanced. We just can't wait until 1992, when we are due to be upgraded to a 16K Speccy. <br> <b> General QT Askey <br> Stoke-on-Trent <br> </b> <br><i> Erm, well done. <b>Ed.</b> </i>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have just designed and built my own yacht for a trans-Atlantic single-handed record bid, but am faced with two problems. Firstly, my yacht 'sits' rather low in the water and I have very little money for 'buoyancy' materials. Secondly, I would welcome any suggestions on stocking up on food (bearing in mind weight and space) 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yours nautically, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir Francis Winchester <p> <i>Dear Sir Francis, <p> Hmm, low waterline problems aren't really my forte, but an ideal and cheap 'buoyancy' material could be close at hand. I suggest you simply invest in several packets of Kelloggs Rice Krispies - if your bilges are water-tight then fill them with the aforementioned multi-purpose breakfast cereal. This will also be useful in more ways than one. Your second dilemma has already been remedied. You can now cut down on weighty food stocks, and revert to eating your nourishing 'buoyancy' material (enriched with five vitamins and minerals). Secondly, should you have the misfortune to suffer a leak you will be immediately alerted by a loud snap, crackle and popping. <br>Cheers, <br>Bud</i> <p>Dear Mr Pico <p>I am writing to express my extreme displeasure about your constant references to Rice Krispies. Surely not every single Do-It-Yourself problem can be rectified by resorting to this breakfast cereal. If this is the case then I'm sure that my own cereal, Slater's Puffy Rice, would serve adequately well. Recently at my daughter's wedding I was unable to purchase any confetti. In lieu of this I made do with showering the happy couple with handfulls of Slater's Puffy Rice. I maintain that my Puffy Rice is as good as its competitors and hope you will recognise this on examination of the enclosed sample. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regards, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alf Slater <p> <i>Dear Alf, <p> Many thanks for the Puffy Rice. I will look into your claims.
