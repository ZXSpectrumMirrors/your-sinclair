A musical note. In a 
trio you have the 
high, middle and 
low instruments to 
provide variety to 
the music. The same goes for 
this collection of three games, 
but we wouldn't advise you 
to play them all at the same 
time. Instead take them one 
by one and you'll discover... 
yes, highs, lows and the 
middle ground. The problem 
is deciding which program is 
which. We couldn't! 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly somebody had 
the bright idea. "Let's throw 
them to the dynamic duo." So 
we locked Gwyn and Rachael 
in the reviewing room to see 
what would happen... then, 
when we had enough 
photographs to blackmail 
them, we sat them down in 
front of a Spectrum! After all, 
two heads are better than 
one, even when one belongs 
to a gormless tottie and the 
other to a crazed strategist. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here's the <I>Trio</I>," we snarled, 
"Now let's hear ya sing!" 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<hr><center><B>AIRWOLF II</B></center><p>
<b>Rachael</b> Well curdle me 
cucumber, mes petits mange 
touts, if it ain't ol' Stringbean 
Hawk and his chopper. He can 
dice my carrot any time he 
likes. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Trio</I> takes off with a sequel to 
the game that won the award 
for the most difficult shoot 'em 
up ever when it first appeared. 
Gameplay was so well judged 
on this that most people never 
survived the first screen. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can understand why 
<I>Airwolf II</I> has appeared on a 
compilation though. The TV 
series is hardly the hot tie-in it 
once was - in fact it's more 
cold salad than boiled 
brussels. The game is much 
more a standard horizontal 
blaster too - none of that 
devilish cavern plot. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the game's all the better 
for that. Because though you'll 
have seen scores of scrollers 
like this in the past there's 
always something addictive 
about a good one - and this is 
certainly well balanced. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sprite size is perfect for 
the play area, so that there's 
lots of room to manoeuvre but 
there's still some detail. Also 
the aliens follow set patterns, 
which lets you learn how to
dodge them as you progress. 
But the best thing is the 
weaponry feature. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You start the game with a 
missile launcher, but it doesn't 
take long before you encounter 
a throbbing spot! No, it's not a 
zit about to burst - it's a 
weapon waiting for you to pick 
it up. You can increase your 
arsenal with smart bombs, 
extra speed, double fire power, 
a plasma gun, a shield and 
who knows what other 
goodies? I certainly don't 
because once you select your 
reserve feature you go back to 
the start again. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That means that it may not 
be wise to use the smart bomb 
every time you get one... it 
may be better to dodge then 
promote it to double fire. 
Dodging plays a big part in this 
game - another reason to 
learn the attack patterns. You 
also have to blow holes in walls 
- a throwback to the original, 
though it's nowhere near so 
impossible this time - and 
negotiate pixel thin tunnels. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monochrome graphics 
are satisfactory and though the 
sound is rather sparse the 
effects are okay. I reckon 
Stringbean and his whirlybird 
could make me a vegetarian. I 
liked it alot-ment. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Gwyn</b> How can I follow a 
mush of mash like that? 
Perhaps I should join the 
Greens, or maybe live in 
Scandinavia and become a 
Swede. Sorry, I can't keep up 
with the punning but for once I 
agree with Rachael. An 
enjoyable shooter which 
wouldn't cut it at full price, but it 
certainly gets <I>Trio</I> off the 
ground. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<center><b>GREAT GURIANOS</b></center><p>
<b>Gwyn</b> Brill idea to call this 
game <I>Great Gwyn-Hughes</I>...
Wha'? Where's me reading 
glasses. Whoops! Sorry. It's 
<I>Gurianos</I>. Hang on... isn't that 
the posh word for bird 
doodles? <I>(No, it's not!
Ornithological Ed)</I>.

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, it seems that the Great 
Gurianos is a warrior 
embarking on a deadly quest 
armed only with a shield and 
razor sharp sword. His 
mission? To make it out of the 
arcades onto the Spectrum 
And he jolly well nearly did it 
... but the fact that he 
surfaced on this compilation 
must suggest that he's not an 
all-time high scorer in the 
conversion hall of fame. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great Gury... sorry, do you 
mind if I call him G.G.? <I>(Nay. 
Ed).( Sorry, do you feel a little 
hoarse? Rachael)</I> G.G. walks 
left to right while a weird 
selection of stars, sparks and 
other assorted mystical
missiles fly at him from the
right. They come thick and fast
so it's time for the frantic 
joystick shuffle, moving the 
sword and shield up and down,.

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secret is to hit flying 
shields to strengthen your 
shield, smash four swords to
get a super sword and slash 
the flying ball for extra armour. 
Try to round up as many of 
these as possible before you
reach the first warrior. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly the action turns 
into a cut and thrust combat 
game and if you thought the 
approach was quick you wait 
tilt you get into close combat. 
You really have to move like 
there's twenty-five thousand 
volts flowing through you if 
you're to kill all your opponents. 
It's here that the super sword 
comes in - it makes you 
invincible. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that's about it! You walk 
and then you scrap and then 
you stroll some more. Not the 
most inspiring of plots, and 
though it all moves 
unbelievably fast and the 
characters are big and 
colourful it's not overly 
playable. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Rachael</b> <I>Disappointing 
Gurianos</I> might have been, a 
better title. It's just lacklustre, 
so unless you were into the 
coin-op original you may find 
you give this one the big E. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<center><b>3DC</b></center><p>
<b>Rachael</b> Round three and it's 
under the sea! But there's 
something decidedly wet about 
this Ultimate-style game... 
particularly when it's seen in 
the light of <I><a href="hydrofool.htm">Hydrofool</a></I>. It 
certainly sinks compared with 
Sweevo's submarine 
adventures. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the usual features are 
here, such as the cryptic 
objects which you collect as 
you wander around the maze 
of soggy screens, the six 
pockets in your diving suit, and 
the time limit which is linked to 
the amount of oxygen you use. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there isn't enough to 
dodge in this arcade adventure 
to get the blood pounding 
through your veins... instead 
it merely trickles. I'm sure 
you're not supposed to doze off 
when you're five fathoms down 
but I reckon I'd rather drown. 
This is definitely Davy Jones-ville! 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a start there are some 
clever landscapes to keep you 
guessing. Then there's Eric the 
Eel, who can be collected then 
used to reach into areas that 
your portly frogman can't get 
into. And let's not forget the 
octopus, which appears 
whenever you dawdle and robs 
you of your oxygen tanks, 
which will leave you gasping. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I liked the way that jumping 
also shortens your life, to make 
you think about what you're 
doing, but it's a pity that your 
diver can't swim - that could 
have livened things up no end. 
I'm sure that it won't take 
forever to solve this but I've 
seen far worse games. Not bad 
considering you can have two 
copies for an ill octopus... or 
should that be a sick squid? 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Gwyn</b> Hey, hang on a minute 
frog-face... err, sorry, 
frogwoman! I reckon Rachael 
doesn't like <I>3DC</I> because 
there's nothing that she can 
shoot in it. Sure, I have to 
agree that the ocean bed is a 
bit bare, but it's no place to nod 
off. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<HR>
<I>Trio</I> is the eternal triangle 
... it's got something for the 
shoot 'em up sure-shot, the 
hand-to-hand melee 
merchant and the arcade 
adventurer with webbed feet. 
But do these three parts add 
up to a satisfactory three 
course meal? 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Gwyn and Rachael felt 
that <I>Airwolf</I> was a lot of fun 
and were disappointed by 
<I>Great Gurianos</I>, but opinions 
differed on <I>3DC</I>. It was a 
classic case of best of three 
falls. In the end Rachael 
decided to be generous, 
mumbling something about 
how the pack should please 
anyone who's just bought a 
Spectrum. So the final scores 
are...  8/10
