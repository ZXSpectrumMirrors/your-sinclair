<b>Knowing full well what a square-eyed bunch you are, we thought it was about time you were
given the facts on film and television licenced games. Once again, <I>JONATHAN DAVIES</I> was in the
wrong place at the wrong time.</b>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Cough, Deep, manly voice.)
'In the beginning
there were loads and loads of Speccy games. Loads of them. They sold all
right, but not exactly in enormous numbers. The trouble was, you see, that
none of them seemed particularity exciting. They had nothing that caught
the public eye. They were just computer games. Had no 'cred'.

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then a small cog within a long-since-extinct
software house had an idea.

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why don't we give our next game the
same name as an incredibly popular film? Then everyone would buy it just
because they'd seen film and they'd foolishly think the game would be
just as good. How about it, eh?"

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Er, we could do, I suppose."

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Great."

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But what if the film company finds out?
They might sue us or something."

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh yeah."

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tcha."

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know - we could ask them first."

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's a point. Go on then."

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? Me?"

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah. Give them a ring and ask if
they'd mind."

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oo-er. Cripes. Okay then."

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Dials very long trans-Atlantic phone
number.)

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hullo, We'd like to name our new game
after your film and we were wandering if it was okay by you. Right...
yes... oh, I see."

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Cups hand over receiver.)

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They want us to give them lots of
money."

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Erm, well in that case we'd better."

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Removes hand.)

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, that'll be fine. We'll send you
some right away. Bye."

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Super."

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How are we going to come up with a game
that's anything like the film?"

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know really."

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How about if we have a bloke walking
around shooting people?"

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That sounds fine, I"ll program it
right away."

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so the film and telly licence was born.
It... cough. Choke.'

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oops. There goes the deep, manly voice.

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, film and telly games, eh? Everyone's
doing them these days, as they're one of the few remaining ways of
making serious money with computer games. Run a grubby finger down the
charts and you"ll find nearly all the top-sellers are film and telly
licences, (Or arcade conversions, of course.)

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But why do we keep buying them? After all,
just because a game's named after a really brill film doesn't mean
it's going to be any good, does it? Surely we aren't buying them simply
because of the flashy name on the box? Erm, well.

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the old days, software houses assumed this
to be the case, and chucked out a stream of absolutely appalling games
with "big name" titles. Things like <I>Miami Vice</I>,
<I>The Dukes Of Hazard</I> and <I>Highlander</I> were
all pretty dreadful, but it was hoped that they'd sell on the strength of
their names. But we weren't fooled. Oh no. The games didn't sell well, and
the companies were forced to think again.

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eventually they came up with... the "bloke
walking around shooting things" idea. And they"ve used it more
or less ever since. Lucky then that they tend to be jolly good all the
same, and sometimes come up with the odd orginal idea to spice things up
(like <I><a href="theuntouchables.htm">The Untouchables</a></I> did, or perhaps <I>Back To The
Future Part II</I>).

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><B>WHAT'S A FILM AND TELLY GAME THEN? HMM?</B><br>
That"s easy. It's a game for which the
software house producing it has had to hand over a vast wad of money to a
film or television so they can call their game <I>The Sound Of Music</I> or
<I>Newsnight</I> or whatever. Distinguishing features are, as you may have
gathered, the name a of a famous film or telly programme splashed across
the box and a bloke who walks round shooting things. Apart from that,
though, just about anything can happen in them. They might be shoot-'em-ups
or collect-'em-ups. They might scroll or they might "flip".
Thet might multiload or they might not. (They usually do though.)

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So they're not very hard to spot at all
then, which makes writing this guide a whole lot easier.

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR><B>THE FIRST-EVER FILM AND TELLY GAME</B><BR>
(Purses lips and inhales very slowly.) That"s
a tricky one. It ought to be pretty easy to pin down Film and Telly Game
Number One, as they haven"t been around for too long compared to
other sorts of game. Well, I reckon (but don't quote me on this) it was
<I>Terrahawks</I> from CRL, the game of the puppet programme. The
thing is, though, I"m sure there was a <I>Blue Thunder</I>
game floating around quite a long time before, but I can't find any
references to it anywhere. So we'll stick with <I>Terrahawks</I>,
eh? And, as was usually the case with these "first-ever" games,
it was pretty useless. There weren't actually any puppets in it for a
start, just a whole bunch of 3D wire-frame building things which you had
to explore (in a spaceship) in the hope of finding a vortex through which
to exit. Our reviewers weren't too impressed and gave it 2 out of 5.
Still, the pioneering spirit was there, and the game was a few months ahead
of the first-ever film game - Activision's <I><a href="thestorysofarvoliv.htm">Ghostbusters</a></I>.
That was pretty hopeless as well, but did extraordinarily well.

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR><B>Ratings:</B><BR>
As always seems to be the case, the trusty old ratings system doesn't
really seem adequate when it comes to film and telly games. So here's what
we've put together instead...<BR>
<TABLE ALIGN="LEFT"><TR><TD><IMG VALIGN="TOP" SRC="film1.gif"></TD></TR></TABLE><B>Lights:</B> What does it look like? Nice? Or
not very nice at all? <I>(You mean are the graphics any good? Ed)</I> Er, yes.
That's it in a nutshell. <I>(Then why didn't you just say that in the
first place? Ed)</I> Erm...<BR>
<TABLE ALIGN="LEFT"><TR><TD><IMG VALIGN="TOP" SRC="film2.gif"></TD></TR></TABLE><B>Camera:</B> How does the general atmosphere
compare to the film or telly programme the game's meant to go with?
Have the programmers just taken a bog-standard game and stuck a flashy
name on it? Or have they made an effort to incorporate a bit of the "feel"
of the original?<BR>
<TABLE ALIGN="LEFT"><TR><TD><IMG VALIGN="TOP" SRC="film3.gif"></TD></TR></TABLE><B>Action:</B> Does the plot follow along the
same sort of lines as the film or telly programme? Is there plenty of
action-packedness? And is the game the same all the way through, or does
it follow the original's twists and turns?<BR>
<TABLE ALIGN="LEFT"><TR><TD><IMG VALIGN="TOP" SRC="film4.gif"></TD></TR></TABLE><B>Cut:</B> Um, how does the game compare to
all the other licences around at the moment? Is it better? Or worse? In
other words, is it a "cut" above the rest? <I>(Is that really the
best you can manage? Ed)</I>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR><B>FILM GAMES</B><BR>
These form the largest category by far. Just
about every major film has a game to go with it, and as there are lots of
films that means lots of games. What they're actually like tends to vary
though. In some cases they're just ordinary beat-'em-ups or shoot-'em-ups
with a very tenuous link with the film (generally just the name). <I>Cobra</I>
and <I>Highlander</I> both went for this approach. Or they might
be much the same sort of thing, but divided up into levels which are meant
to refer to scenes from the film. Since most films are just beat-'em-ups
and shoot-'em-ups anyway this tends to work pretty well, as with <I><a href="robocop.htm">Robocop</a></I>
and <I><a href="2hot2handle.htm">Total Recall</a></I>. Last of all are the games which are
split up into completely different levels, like the early Bond efforts.
There might be driving bits, walking bits and puzzle-solving bits, and
they're usually pretty faithful to segments in the film. They do tend to
pay a heavy price in terms of quality though (so be careful).

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR><B>CARTOON GAMES</B><BR>
Moving into television territory here, and
these are generally the most popular telly games, especially on budget
labels (witness <I><a href="hannabarberacollection.htm">Hong Kong Phooey</a></I>, <I>Count Duckula</I>,
all that sort of thing). The licences are probably pretty cheap to
acquire, especially if the cartoon hasn't been on for about 20 years, and
they're a doddle to convert to the computer. Cartoony graphics are about
the easiest to pull off successfully on the Speccy, so they always look
good. What you get under the surface though tends to be a very ordinary
beat-'em-up or arcade adventure.

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR><B>QUIZ GAMES</B><BR>
Another popular category, this, as television
game shows are just begging to be computerised. They're mainly just a case
of answering silly questions and filling in spaces on a scoreboard (or
something), both things the Speccy is ideally suited to. There's usually
the odd digitised piccy of your 'host' thrown in for luck, and lots of
irritating tunes from the telly programme. Whether they're any good or not
is very much a matter of opinion. The programming's usually well up
to scratch, and they're always faithful replicas of the telly versions.
But, as TV game shows are utter dross, the games tend to be too. Check out
<I><a href="sportingtriangles.htm">Sporting Triangles</a></I> and <I>Bob's Full House</I>
(if you must).

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR><B>OTHER TELLY GAMES</B><BR>
There are all sorts of things left over, of
course. There are the Gerry Anderson puppet programmes, which have formed
the basis of the odd decent game. There are crusty old series like <I>Flash
Gordon</I>. There are modern(ish) American programmes like <I>Knight
Rider</I> and <I>Miami Vice</I> which haven't proved too
successful on the Spectrum. There are 'cult' programmes like <I>The
Munsters</I> and <I><a href="montypythonsflyingcircus.htm">Monty Python's Flying Circus</a></I>. There are kiddies'
shows like <I>Postman Pat</I>. All sorts of things really.

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><center><font size=5><b><i><a href="completeguidetoshootemups2.htm">Rambo</a></i></b></font><br>
Ocean</center><p>
This one goes back a bit, being
one of the first film games ever. (Quite possibly number two after <I><a href="thestorysofarvoliv.htm">Ghostbusters</a></I>.)
And, of course, it stars Rambo who walks round shooting people. He's got
a large map to wander round though and plenty of weapons to collect,
along with an overhead view to make them easier to spot. After plodding
round the jungle fighting off enemy soldiers for a bit he comes across
the enemy village which can only be got into at a certain point (a
bridge, in fact). In there he finds the hostage he's after, who needs
cutting free, and then moves on to find a helicopter and fly it to
freedom.

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering its age (five-ish), <I><a href="completeguidetoshootemups2.htm">Rambo</a></I>
isn't bad at all. The range of weapons available is well thought-out,
with the ones that do the most damage tending to attract the attention
of more enemy troops. The only trouble is the jerky 'flipping' scroll
system and the graphics, which tend to be mainly empty black spaces. A
good one.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><center><font size=5><b><i>The Flintstones</i></b></font><br>
Grandslam</center><p>
Thank goodness <I>The
Flintstones</I> isn't on anymore, eh? Long, boring and raising only
the most canned of laughter, it made 5.30 to 6pm a nightmare every time
it was on. Almost makes you grateful that <i><a href="neighbours.htm">Neighbours</a></i> came along and took
over, doesn't it?

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A computer version was inevitable though.
So inevitable, in fact, that there are two of them - <I>Yabba Dabba
Doo</I>, which was a boring wandering-around-collecting-things game,
and this one which is more of a multi-stage, lots of sub-games affair.
First of all, Fred's got to paint a wall of his cave, using a squirrel's
tail as a brush (ho ho) and trying to stop Pebbles (his irritating
daughter who appeared just as the cartoon was really going downhill)
from scribbling all over it. It's about as fun as painting a wall for
real. Then there's a bit where he has to fix his car (by the way, can
anyone explain how the Flintstones' car is steered?) before driving down
to the bowling alley for a game of whatever it is they do there. Finally
you've got to rescue Pebbles from a building site. It looks nice, but
gets very boring jolly quickly.

Electric Dreams</center><p>
The film was probably a bit
crap (I didn't actually see it), and so's the game unfortunately.
It's a very ordinary scrolling beat-'em- up where you've got to rescue a
couple of chicks who've been kidnapped by some baddie or other. There
are a couple of novelties. The most exciting one is that it scrolls from
left to right (i.e. your character walks along from right to left),
which means that the other innovation isn't very thrilling at all. You
actually control three characters, although two of them just follow the
third around. You've got to swop between them to take advantage of the
special skills of each.

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The graphics aren't particularly good, naff
animation being their main problem. There's not a lot of variety either
- just two main types of baddie and the odd weapon to pick up. But the
numero uno snag is that it just feels a bit silly. The character under
your control responds very strangely to the controls - not in the least
bit 'human' - and the other two look ridiculous following your every
move. Worst of all though is that it's just a beat-'em-up with a film's
name bolted on. Tsk.

Mosaic</center><P>
The 'hilarious' Downing
Street-based sitcom would seem to be virtually impossible to convert to
the Spectrum, and indeed Mosaic (who?) had to come up with a completely
original structure for the game. Thankfully they avoided a predictable
'walk around Whitehall collecting things and beating people up' game and
plumped instead for a semi-adventure game where you've got solve
prime-ministerial problems over a period of five days to get your poll
ratings up to a decent level.

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The game revolves around your desk, where
you receive memos and phone calls informing you of what's going on. The
most important events are meetings with your colleagues where you have
lengthy conversations interspersed with multiple-choice bits. Pick the
right thing to say and your standing improves, with a corresponding
increase in your poll rating. It actually works very well as a game, and
somehow manages to pack in all the atmosphere and humour of the 
programme while still being fun to play. It's a bit text-based though,
and certainly won't appeal to everyone.

Actually this is more of an
arcade conversion than a film and telly game, but we were a bit
desperate. It's the game of the really old arcade game of the film, you
see, but it just about sneaks into our definition of things. It's
actually quite good as film games go as it makes an excellent attempt to
stick to the film's plot without getting too bitty and generally crap.
Also, and most critically, it doesn't have a bloke walking round
shooting things. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You're Luke Skywalker, and what you've got
to do is destroy the Death Star. This means firing up your X-Wing
fighter, flying through space warding off enemy TIE fighters, then
flying over the Death Star picking off towers and finally flying through
a ventilation duct (or something) to take out the Death Star's heart at
the end. It's laid out as a 3D wire-frame shoot-'em-up which was
impressive when it appeared in the arcades all those years ago and still
plays well today. The only weird thing is that it's pretty easy to
complete all three levels, whereupon you wrap back round to the first
and end up destroying the Death Star 20 or 30 times per game. Spooky.

The telly version of this was
one of those one-series wonders that was once very popular but fizzled
out after no time at all. Which was a bit unfortunate for Ocean really,
who took absolutely ages to get this game out, after completely
rewriting it at one stage, so that it arrived at rather an awkward time.

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's one of these playing-it-safe film
games - really just a scrolling shoot-'em-up that could have been called
just about anything. It's more like <I><a href="historyinthemaking.htm">Spy Hunter</a></I> than
anything else, with vertical scrolling, you on a bike instead of a car
and plenty of other traffic to shoot/avoid. And that's about it really,
apart from a Jump key which lets you, erm, jump over other traffic, a
Turbo key for a bit of extra speed and every so often a baddy who
appears on the road and shoots at you. It's not outstanding in any way,
but the graphics are slicker than usual and it's got quite a good "<I>Street
Hawk</I>" feel to it. All that's missing is variety, so it gets
boring after a while. Oh, and our resident biker and Art Assistant says
that "his off-side crankshaft sprocket's not quite to scale".
We told him to shut up.

Along with <I><a href="robocop.htm">Robocop</a></I>,
which is probably the biggest-selling game of any kind ever, this was
one of Ocean's biggest sellers last year. Its success was obviously a
result of the film's popularity rather than anything great about the
game itself, although it's very well put together and enjoyable all the
same.

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Needless to say, Batman is the chap you
control, and he walks around killing people. Well, on the first and last
levels he does anyway. These are easily the best, with Bat-rope and
Batarang featuring prominently. The rest of the game consists of a
driving bit, which is a bit boring, a flying bit, which is also slightly
tedious, and a puzzle-solving bit. The graphics all the way through are
great, if a bit monochrome, and the game is generally one of the most 
comprehensive film conversions around. It's just a bit obvious that all
the programming effort went into the walking-about parts, and they're
the bits that are just like any other film game. Ho hum.

Here's another film game, and
like so many others its star is Arnold Schwarzenegger. That means, of
course, that it's a scrolling shoot-'em-up. It's set in the South
American jungle where Arnie's up against not only the usual rebel
guerillas but a mysterious alien foe as well.

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In akchaw fact, I've just spotted that the
scrolling, shooting bit is only Level One. There are two more sections
as well (which multiload, naturally) where you actually come up against
the alien who's been pestering you all through the first part. And
there's also an impressive but lengthy scene-setting intro sequence
where you see the alien landing from outer space. Sadly, however, Level
One's a bit on the tricky side, which means that the rest of the game is
out of bounds to all but the most hardened game. Still, the first
level's quite nice, with pretty graphics and a fair amount of variety.
What a shame we don't get to see the rest, eh, readers?

Domark didn't have much luck
with their early Bond games. They weren't desperately bad, but the
programming smacked of amateurism and they were generally considered to
be wasted opportunities. What those first games had though, which <I><a href="licencetokill.htm">Licence
To Kill</a></I> doesn't, is a reasonable level of originality. They were
multiloaders with several very different (if slightly crap) levels,
while this one is more of a vertically-scrolling shoot-'em-up with
very minor differences between levels.

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are flying levels, driving levels,
walking levels and even swimming levels. They're all
vertically-scrolling. And they're all quite good. Yes, although it's not
brilliant, this Bond game has at least been properly put together. The
graphics are fine, it plays quite well and ties in with the film pretty
convincingly. But it's still only 'quite' a good film game. It proves
Domark can program properly if they really try, but it doesn't really
further the cause of licences by extracting much inspiration from the
film.

<I>Howard The Duck</I>
started off as a cartoon, progressed to a pretty chronic film (which
attracted a limp cult following) and then moved onto the Spectrum. And
like the film, the game was projected to be a huge success but wasn't
really at all. Howard, then, is a duck, but not a nice, chummy one like
Donald or Daffy. He wields a Neutron Disintegrator and is a Quack Fu
Master. Rather handy, that, as he's faced with the prospect of having to
rescue some of his pals who've been stranded on an island by the Dark
Overlord.

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, presumably Howard walks round shooting
people? Well, yes he does, but for a change you get an overhead view and
Howard's in a maze. There are pools of slime to jump over, rivers to
cross with the aid of a jet pack, and plenty of things to collect. And
after that there are various mini-games to complete before you get to
take on the Dark Overlord. It's all very well programmed and everything,
but not all that inspiring.

So <I><a href="thestorysofarvoliv.htm">Ghostbusters</a></I>
was the first film game then. And it was a huge hit as well, the first
Speccy release to sell over, erm, some huge number of copies, despite
being a bit rubbish. So a <I><a href="ghostbustersii.htm">Ghostbusters II</a></I> game seemed
only natural (or as natural as a small piece of plastic with two holes
in it can look), and this is it.

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's a slickly-put-together little number,
unlike the first game which was distinctly rough around the edges, and
follows the plot of the film very closely. In fact, just in case you're
not too sure what's going on, it tells the plot as the game progresses
along with digitised pictures from the film. In-between all this you've
got about three sub-games to tackle - a bit where you're descending a
shaft picking off ghosts, a horizontally-scrolling shooting bit and
something else too. The only problem is that all these bits have to be
loaded in separately using an appalling multiloader which makes you load
everything more or less from scratch every time you bite the dust. It
may not sound too disastrous, but it is (believe me) and knocks a good
20 or 30 degrees off what is otherwise a jolly good film game.

Bob fans will find that this
one's worth getting if only for the digitised pictures of their ageing
hero to be found within. They're even animated (sort of), so Bob reads
out the questions and grins broadly when you get one right. Everything
else is there too, like the signature tune, the Gold Run and even the
odd "Can I have a P please, Bob?" if you keep your eyes
peeled.

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if you find the telly version
compulsive, the game should set your adrenaline pumping too. There are
one- and two-player versions to choose between. The two-player game
proceeds pretty much like the programme, while in the one-player version
you only lose a square if you answer a question incorrectly. And there
are plenty of questions. Several load-fulls, in fact, with 50 in each so
you shouldn't find repetition a problem. Well, question repetition that 
is. The game as a whole is incredibly repetitive, just like the telly
programme. If you like the show then the game is just as good. And if
you don't it's, er, just as bad.

Here's another mystifyingly
well-known program. But why make a game out of it? It was bound to end
up as a walking-around-collecting-things game. Sweep's left his bones
lying around all over the house and, rather than kicking his teeth in,
Sooty decides to help him clear them all up. This means wandering round,
picking up bones and trying to avoid all the creepy-crawlies that have
sneaked in from the garden.

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's a dire idea, of course, and the only
ray of hope is the two-player option where Sooty and Sweep are competing
to collect the most bones. And calling it 'a game for younger players'
is no excuse either.

At last a decent licence and a
half-decent game. <I>Count Duckula</I> is a mildly amusing
cartoon along the same lines as <I>Danger Mouse</I> (who's got
a couple of computer games of his own), and its central character is a
vampire duck. He's a 'nice' vampire, naturally, and your job is to help
him, erm, walk round collecting things. Sob. But that's what we're stuck
with, so let's make the most of it, eh?

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's just about the best budget licence
around actually, with attractive graphics, plenty of rooms to explore,
lots of mapping potential and a particularly odd cheat mode. But
original it's not.

Postman Pat, as you probably

nauseating kiddies' programs. He's irritatingly smug, overwhelmingly
tacky and inexplicably popular. There's Postman Ruddy Pat merchandise
everywhere you look, and the licence was bound to be snapped up by some
eager cheapie software house.

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the result, and it's a predictable
walk-around-delivering-things game. Pat drives around in his van
stopping at houses where's he's given errands to run. And that's about
