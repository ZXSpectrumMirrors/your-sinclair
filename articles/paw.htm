<div><b>Want to know whether to buy Gilsoft's latest adventure 
writing utility, the <i>Professional Adventure Writer</i>? Never 
mind the benchmarks, <i>Mike Gerrard</i> applies the exclusive 
<i>YS</i> Pawmarks Test and puts some animal magic back into 
your adventures. </b>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you fed up of playing 
adventures written by 
someone else? Fancy a go at 
writing your own? Well, 
Gilsoft may well have come 
up with the ideal package to let you 
try. It's called the <i>Professional Adventure 
Writer</i>, or <i>PAW</i> for short, and its 
purpose in life is to transfer your 
brilliant adventuring ideas from the 
drawing board to the Speccy. The 
package comes complete with a 66-page introductory manual, a 72-page 
technical guide, and a sample adventure 
called <i>Tewk</i>, showing some enterprising 
uses of <i>PAW</i>'s facilities. So, what will 
you need to turn all your ideas into 
proper stories? Let's take it from the 
top... 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>PAWQUILL?</b><br>
<i>PAW</i> works in the same menu-driven 
manner as <i>The Quill</i>, and the screen 
layout will look totally familiar to 
experienced users, 'cos many of the same 
single-letter commands are retained. A 
major difference is that the program now 
works on the first five letters of each 
word, rather than the first four, making it 
far more versatile. Unfortunately you still 
can't have both an orange <i>and</i> an orangutan in your game, but a mouse and a 
moustache will be possible! Other 
differences are that the text is formatted 
automatically on-screen (no need to fill 
those location descriptions up with blank 
spaces to make it look smart), there are 
256 flags, various commands like GET 
ALL and PUT ALL, an understanding of 
IT and THEM, a much more comprehensive parser and the ability to input speech 
and pseudo-intelligent characters... disc 
jockeys, orang-utans and magazine 
editors, that kind of thing. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>RAISE THE FLAG!</b><br> 
Of the 256 flags, many (well, 42 to be 
precise) are set aside for specific 
purposes - just like <i>The Quill</i> really. That 
still leaves you with... erm... (removes 
shoes to help counting)... 214 of your 
own to play around with. Flag 38, for 
instance, is always your current location, 
flag 1 is the number of objects carried 
and flag 46 is the current pronoun (to 
identify the use of IT and THEM). The 
most powerful addition here, and one 
that will be a real boon when testing 
adventures, is the ability to change a 
flag's value when playing through the 
game using diagnostics. For instance, if 
you discover that the snake won't move 
out of the way, despite the fact that 
you've fed it with the dead rat, and the 
reason is that you've forgotten to change 
the flag that governs whether the snake 
has been fed or is hungry, then you're 
able to alter the flag's value and carry on 
playing, rather than have to return to the 
database to do it. If you discover you 
haven't allowed the player to carry 
enough objects, increase the value of flag 
37. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>PLAYING BY NUMBERS </b><br>
Words are allocated a main number, and 
are usually given a secondary number to 
indicate what type of word they are - 
all nouns are number 2, all verbs are 
zero. The main number of a word is the 
one which identifies it in the vocabulary 
table. For instance, values of 49 and 
under are reserved for proper nouns 
usually the names of people and places. 
This means the parser will ignore them 
when it tries to interpret what IT or 
THEM refers to. Normally if you use the 
word IT then the parser will check back 
to the last noun typed in and assume 
that's what the IT refers to. Fine, you 
might say, isn't that always the case? 
Well, think about this sentence: GET 
THE BUN AND FEED THE ELEPHANT 
WITH IT. The parser would check back 
and discover that you're trying to feed 
the elephant with the elephant, and it'd 
faint at the prospect of trying to carry 
out that command. By giving the elephant 
a number of 49 or under, the parser 
ignores the elephant and realises that IT 
refers to the bun. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>OBJECTS</b><br> 
Objects aren't just objects anymore, 
they can now be light or heavy, be 
worn and removed, and be containers 
as well. If you try to PUT THE 
PEANUTS IN THE PARROT, for 
instance, or put anything into 
something that isn't a container, then 
you can program in a suitable 
response such as 'No way' or 'What 
a concept!' However, you might 
decide to make a kangaroo into a 
container, so PUT PEANUTS IN 
KANGAROO is okay, perhaps 
producing a response of 'You put the 
peanuts in the kangaroo's pouch.' 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Giving weights to your objects is 
straightforward enough, and you can 
set a weight limit that someone can 
carry, rather than specify a number of 
objects - maybe eating a can of 
spinach produces extra strength, so 
just change the flag that covers the 
weight you can manage. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wearable objects are also 
automatically removable, but if you do 
want to program a straight-jacket into 
the game there are ways round that. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>PARSING TIME </b><br>
I suspect that an adventure could have 
the most stunning mega-parser in the 
world, and most people would still go 
round typing in GET HIPPO, DROP 
OSTRICH, and so on. But there are 
times when the simple verb-noun formula 
is restricting, and <i>PAW</i> will cope with a 
sentence containing up to one verb, two 
nouns, two adjectives to go with the 
nouns, one adverb, one preposition, and 
speech to another character. This speech 
is contained in quotes, and can contain 
up to one noun, two verbs... and so on. 
Don't try and put speech inside the 
speech, though. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maximum acceptable input is 125 
characters, but within that you can string 
together as many sentences as you like, 
provided each is separated by some form 
of punctuation or AND or THEN, though 
you can change that to any other suitable 
word - if you can think of one! 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Verbs are remembered, so GET THE 
FERRET AND THE FROG would be 
understood and acted upon, and you can 
even manage to fool the program into 
understanding the word EXCEPT. The 
way the 'ALL' command works, f'rinstance 
in GET ALL, DROP ALL, PUT ALL, is to 
make the verb act on each noun in turn 
that could possibly be got or dropped, 
but if you type GET ALL EXCEPT THE 
FROG, then 'FROG' is removed from the 
nouns to be got and is left where it is, 
the verb in this case not being carried 
forward and repeated. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Multiple input is useful when you want 
to whizz through a section of an 
adventure while you go and make a cup 
of tea - GO NORTH, GET THE BUN 
AND FEED IT TO THE ELEPHANT 
THEN SAY TO THE PARROT "WEAR 
THE EYE-PATCH AND COME HERE." 
The speed with which <i>PAW</i> whips 
through a sequence of commands like 
this is incredible, though it's hardly fair to 
criticise a program for being too fast! 
You'll have to pause the parser with the 
PAUSE command if you want the player 
to see what's happening. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>CHARACTER ACTING </b><br>
<i>PAW</i> will allow up to five different 
character sets in memory at the same 
time, in addition to the standard 
Spectrum set, and you can switch 
between these as and when you choose. 
A file provided with <i>PAW</i> gives 22 fonts 
for you to choose from, but there's also 
a character editor which allows you to 
design your own should none of the 22 
be quite right. You can also use this to 
design UDG's, and create 16 of your own 
shading patterns for use in the Graphics 
Editor. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>FOLLOW THE PROCESSION </b><br>
As with <i>GAC</i>, <i>PAW</i> has a series of process 
tables by which you give priority to 
various actions, the main ones being 
called simply Process 1 and Process 2. 
The first contains anything that you want 
to happen after the program has printed 
the location description but before the 
player takes a turn, the second responds 
to the player's input and awaits the next 
turn. In total, though, you can have up to 
254 process tables, called from the main 
ones in the way that sub-routines work 
in a program. One could keep track of a 
particular object, say, or another could 
look after one of the characters you've 
created. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>PSI'S ALL ROUND </b><br>
A pseudo-intelligent character or PSI, is a 
character, whose activities can be 
gathered together in one of the process 
tables, though Gilsoft's really used flags, 
messages and responses more 
intelligently. Say you want your game to 
have a goat, which constantly gets your 
goat by trying to eat some vital object 
you need - and you have to distract it 
with a pot of glue to gum its mouth up. 
Use one of your flags as a counter, and 
every ten moves the goat will arrive in 
the player's location. He has one chance 
to deal with the goat, which will be to 
DROP GLUE, and unless he's carrying 
the glue he must leave the location or 
the goat will eat one of the objects the 
player's carrying. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alternatively, the goat can be made to 
wander around the location, or a set of 
locations, by itself, and the confrontation 
only occurs when the player and goat 
turn up at the same place at the same 
time. Your process table for the goat will 
be along the lines of: is the goat in this 
location? If not, go back to the main 
table. If it is, wait for the player's input, 
and if this isn't DROP GLUE or an exit 
move then check the player's inventory 
for something edible and eat it. Then 
print a message saying THE GOAT LICKS 
ITS LIPS AND LEAVES YOU IN PEACE. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>PAW</i> also, includes a 'real-time' facility, 
enabling certain things to happen while 
the player's thinking... the adventure goes 
on around you. I wonder what good 
programmers will make of this option! 
One of the additional files on the <i>PAW</i> 
tape will be familiar to anyone who's 
bought <i>The Press</i>. This takes your 
database and searches it for common 
groups of letters, then changes these into 
single tokens to save on memory. The 
only drawback to this feature is the time 
it can take... anything up to an hour and 
more for lengthy adventures! 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>PAW DRAW </b><br>
The graphics section of <i>PAW</i> is similar 
to <i>The Illustrator</i>, and allows you to 
choose how you want your screen 
layout to look. Do you want a full 
graphics screen to be replaced by text 
at the touch of a key, as with the 
original <i>Quill</i>/<i>Illustrator</i> combination? Or 
maybe a consistent split between text 
and graphics areas? Or a variable split, 
with some graphics taking up smaller 
sections of the screen? Or a text that 
scrolls up the screen and edges the 
picture out of the way? All these can be 
used, and varied within a game - no 
need to be consistent at all. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are fewer drawing options 
than <i>GAC</i> but equally good results 
should be possible. The full routine 
seems faster than <i>GAC</i>, and sub-pictures 
can be called up, though the SCALE 
command seems to have disappeared. 
There's a Kempston joystick option, 
and the helpful background grid can be 
toggled on and off as required. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>TAKE-FIVE </b><br>
To make maximum use of the memory, 
Gilsoft has put five additional files on the 
tape after the main program, as well as 
the one containing the extra fonts. These 
are loaded in when you choose the 
various menu options, which might sound 
a little fiddly but it works perfectly well if 
you've got a tape counter, although you 
can easily transfer the CODE files to 
separate tapes if you wish. The files 
cover menu options like saving and 
verifying the adventure, the graphics and 
character editor sections, the messages 
table, text compressor and so on. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>WHAT'S IN IT FOR  128K 
OWNERS? </b><br>
Quite a lot, not surprisingly. The 
program checks which machine it's being 
loaded into at the start, though 128K 
owners can load in 48K mode and still 
produce adventures for the smaller 
machine. Big Speccies can have an 
adventure database of about 112K, thanks 
to <i>PAW</i>'s overlay technique. 48K owners 
have a series of sequential files on the 
tape (see '<i>Take-Five</i>' ) which have to be 
loaded in before certain sections of 
the <i>PAW</i>'s menu can be worked on, but 
128K owners won't need to make use of 
this facility till their database has passed 
the 92K mark. It might just be possible 
to squeeze a decent adventure into 112K! 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>The DIY adventuring trail started with 
Gilsoft, when it bought out <i>The Quill</i> a 
couple of years ago. Incentive followed 
this up with the <i>Graphic Adventure 
Creator</i>, and now Gilsoft's hit back with 
<i>PAW</i> and an initial look makes it hard 
to fault this program. Indeed, I found 
<i>PAW</i> as pleasurable to use as <i>The Quill</i> 
when it first appeared. Although I 
raved over <i>GAC</i> in the August issue, I 
make no excuses for raving over <i>PAW</i> 
now - this type of utility program is 
constantly improving. Gilsoft's parser is 
much better than Incentive's, the ability 
to speak to characters is welcome, as 
is the range of fonts, the RAM save, 
the character editor and the 48K/128K 
options. It comes on cassette or 
microdrive at the moment, and there 
are Beta, Disciple and Opus disk 
versions in preparation. There's also 
bound to be a Plus 3 disk version too 
when the machine finally appears. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you consider the quality of 
many of today's <i>Quill</i>'d adventures, just 
think how they'll look when they've 
been <i>PAW</i>'d. And it won't only be old 
adventures that get the tickling up 
there's bound to be a whole flood of 
<i>PAW</i>'d adventures very soon.
