<p> <font size=4><b> WOLLOP!</b></font><br> Cor! What a man! Wauurrrrrr!! What a hunk! At last, my desperate search has been completed. I have found a <i>new idol</i>! After seeing your line-up of 'chunks' in the September issue, I suddenly realised that I wasn't quite so desperate as to consider Phil South for an idol after all. I decided he was too ugly to be <i>anybody's</i> idol. <i>(Sob! Phil)</i> The same applies to Peter George (are you sure he's human?). Marcus Berkmann can be summed up in three words: cute, but fat. But then... my eyes fell on <i>his</i> picture, and I took a sharp intake of breath and screamed WOW!! My heart leapt as I studied Darrell King's face. Even now my heart pounds every time I think of that clean-shaven, strong chiselled jaw and those piercing... er... black and white eyes. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is this guy! I thought. I've got to know more about him. For example: 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) Who is he? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Where have you been hiding him all this time? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) How old is he? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4) Does he model for <i>Playgirl</i>? If not, why not? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5) Is he married? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6) What's his bank balance? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7) Is there any chance of me having a peek at his life insurance policy? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You'll have to excuse me now, but I must dash off and smother Darrell's picture with kisses for the 8,976th time. <br> <b> Claire "I love Darrell <br> King' Terry <br> Coxford, Southampton <br> </b> <br><i> Lucky old Darrell, eh? I do think you've been a bit hard on Phil and Peter, but I totally agree with you about Marcus. In answer to your questions: 1. Darrell is the Designer on </i>YS<i>, which means he's tres trendy. 2. We haven't been hiding him - he's just very shy. Like a badger, he only comes out at night. 3. Twenty-three. 4. He doesn't model for </i>Playgirl<i> because he models for a more superior magazine - this one! 5. Only to his job! 6. Raisonable. 7 Don't be disgusting! As your picture of Darrell has probably gone all soggy by now I'm printing another one for you to dribble over. <b>Ed</b> <p><center><a href="../thumbs/letters/big/25a.jpg"><IMG SRC="../thumbs/letters/25a.jpg"></a></center><p> </i> <p> <TABLE align=center BORDER BGCOLOR=white BACKGROUND=""><TR><TD> <FONT SIZE=6><B><U>STAR LETTER</U></b></font><br><font size=4><b> ROGUISH BEEFCAKE</b></font><br> After seeing your reply to our previous letter, we came up with this poem: 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Peter George is such a sight 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He really gave us a fright 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his face so haggard and hairy, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does he know that he's so scary? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his scowl so mean and black 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's enough to give anyone a heart attack. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for being butch and manly 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are sexier teddies inside Hamleys. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all he's not that bad 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This roguish beefcake of a lad, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With looks so dark and jaws so square 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's such a shame about the facial hair. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the photo he looked so nice 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now he's got us thinking twice. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ed, why don't you do him a favour?

This is it - the biggy! Forget that thing called Spectrum, and throw your trainspotting equipment in the bin, 'cos a new craze is about to hit the world! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Geddout your back issues of <i>YS</i> and take a gander at those cut-price software ads. Now spot those mistakes! ...Tantails (surely not <i><a href="tantalus.htm">Tantalus</a></i>?), Hydrofoil(?), Transformal(?!), Eat Worm (eugh!), Exagon (not <i><a href="exolon.htm">Exolon</a></i>, by any chance?), and Dark Septre to name a few. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do I want for sparking off this new craze? Well, a Spectrum +3 <i>(Knew that was coming, somehow Ed)</i>, a lifetime supply of <i>YS</i>, a Porsche, all the new software, a packet of polos, a Videoface Digitizer, and an Opus Discovery 2 would do very nicely, but I'll settle for a mention in your great mag! <br> <b> Stuart Green <br> Strensall, York <br> </b> PS How do you increase the IQ of the <i>YS</i> team? Sack Phil South! <br> <br><i> Stuart, your letter was so entertaining, that we feel we must give you one of those prizes you asked for. So we've just written them all down on pieces of paper, put them into a hat, and now we're going to pick one out completely at random! (Drum roll) And the result is... Stuart, you are the lucky winner of a packet of Polos! Or at least you would have been if Phil hadn't eaten 'em. Oh well, never mind, but a badge is on its way <b>Ed</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> WIGGLY TIPS</b></font><br> Here's a small tip which could help you solve your loading problems. If you have a game and you've tried every volume possible to load it, try this. If you look at the tape recorder you'll find above the row of buttons, a small hole and in the hole is a screw. The hole is there to adjust the head of your tape recorder. If you have a very thin star screwdriver, simply take your tape out, press play, put the screwdriver down the hole, and slightly adjust the head clockwise or anti-clockwise, then load in your tape. Keep on doing this until it loads, but remember, don't run it too far anti-clockwise or the screw will come out! Unless it's a very bad copy this will load it. <br> <b> Tom Burns <br> Kilbirnie, Ayrshire <br> </b> <br><i> That's brilliant - unless of course you've got a Spectrum Plus 3! <b>Ed</b> </i>

What is this computer magazine coming to? On page 83 there is an advert for X-rated Adult-Only games. What perverse person wrote such trash for the Spectrum? How can a highly respected magazine like <i>YS</i> publish such ads? Surely you are not that desperate for money that you find it necessary to degrade the mag with "X-rated Adult-Only Games". <br> <b> Martin Stonebridge <br> Ipswich, Suffolk <br> </b> PS When are you going to review these games? <br> <br><i> After noticing the advert myself, we wrote off for the games to see what they were like.

I tried to load my fave game (<i><a href="ghostbusters128.htm">Ghostbusters</a></i>). To my utter disgust every time I loaded it, the screen went blank. I got so cross that I hit my Speccy with the May copy of <i>YS</i>. I loaded <i><a href="ghostbusters128.htm">Ghostbusters</a></i> and guess what? It played for yonks after that and I still have that May copy. I read <i>YS</i> every month and think it is fab. If you don't print this in the Star Letter slot my mum will stop me reading <i>YS</i> for five months (we bet five YSs). My mum needs the three fave games for my dad's birthday. <br> <b> Nicola J Herbert <br> Wilmslow, Cheshire <br> </b> <br><i> Glad to hear </i>YS<i> comes in so useful. We've found it particularly handy in keeping Phil on his diet. We simply roll up a copy of </i>YS<i>, preferably the October issue, and stick it in his gob so he can't eat.

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Moneypenny has diligently scoured the files and has found that the first person to play James Bond was an American actor named Barry Nelson, in a version of <i>Casino Royale</i> made for CBS Television in 1954 - a full eight years before Sean Cannery was to become Bond in Dr No. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In your magazine, the question raised was which actor named Niven played Bond in the first ever Bond film, <i>Casino Royale</i>, and our intelligence section feels that this is where the confusion has arisen. David Niven did indeed play 007 in a version of this film but this was what is known as a 'spoof' version and we don't like to talk about it too much. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commander Bond would be grateful if you would set the above facts out for your readers. He also made reference to something called a 'Trainspotter Award' and something about exploding joysticks if he didn't receive one. Send him a badge or something to keep him quiet. <br> <b> M (alias Chris Fallon, <br> Runcorn, Cheshire) <br> </b> PS We have just learnt that one of your cartographers (look it up) is a double agent. His name is Mischa Welch and his work has also appeared in <i>CRUSH</i> magazine. Liquidate him at once. <br> <br><i> Well, there's a thing! I've never heard of Barry Nelson but I'm sure you're right. I don't really fancy having a joystick explode in my face so I'll send Bondy Babes a badge as you suggest. Is your PS written in some sort of code.'? 'Cos we don't actually have any rag and bone men working for us. Well, except for Kippers Cox the publisher. <b>Ed</b> </i> <p> </td></tr></table><p> <font size=4><b> BLIND DATE</b></font><br> While looking at the rules for the Slaine Warp Spasm compo in the October issue of <i>YS</i> I noticed that the second rule was: "You'd be out of your hero harness not to get your entry in by September 30th." I know <i>YS</i> goes on sale a couple of weeks before the month on the cover, but shouldn't you give the readers more time to get their entries in? <br> <b> Fiona Collinson <br> Kirkliston, Edinburgh <br> </b> PS I think <i><a href="batty.htm">Batty</a></i>'s brill! <br> <br><i> Oops!
