<b> Here we are again. And I'm in the worst mood I've ever been in in my whole life. I'm in such a bad mood I think I'm going to have to smash something up. I know, I'll ask Andy if I can borrow his Walkman for a minute. (Sound of Andy passing Walkman over followed by sound of Walkman being smashed into tiny pieces.) There, that's better. Tension gone. Time for you lot. </b> <p> <font size=4><b> THE ENGINES CANNA TAKE IT</b></font><br> T'other day I was reading the Trainspotter bit in ish 55 and saw your announcement that ships travel faster than the speed of light in <i>Buck Rogers</i> and <i>Star Trek</i>. I just thought I'd clarify things a bit. First off, in <i>Buck Rogers</i> they use the rather boring 'stargate'. In <i>Star Trek</i>, however, a rather more complex method is used. Taking the Enterprise class NCC1701, its engines generate a localised space warp which holds the contents of the warp bubble in a version of this universe which is called warp space. Warp space is a kind of shadowy version of normal space - most massive objects (planets, stars) affect warp space. Singularities (black holes etc) actually exist there. The major difference between normal space and warp space is that in warp space there's no 'cosmic speed limit'. A ship in warp drive can go as fast as you like - the only limitation is the structural strength of a ship. The Enterprise can cope with up to warp 12, but her engines only provide a maximum of warp eight (for ten hours). <br> <b> Duncan Corps <br> Farnborough, Hampshire <br> </b> <br><i> What do you mean "The rather boring stargate"? What's so boring about stargates? I personally find them quite fascinating - and far more functionable than crap old warp drives. You just head into them and 'zammo', out you come into another sector of space. If you want to get into warp space you firstly have to have a ten minute argument with Scotty about whether the Dylithium crystals are going to work or whether the engines can or canna take the strain. What a hassle. <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> SECRET DESIRES</b></font><br> Tell Meryl Streep and Meg Ryan (ish 56) that I won't ignore them, and tell Dominic Brookman's sister that even if the covers are lurid they couldn't possibly exploit my secret desires. Oh, and tell Martin Van Spanje that Dutch undies look pretty uncomfortable - and that I like acid on my french fries. I don't know... these Dutch, hopeless... hopeless. <br> <b> Noel 'Gibble Bug' Byrne <br> Balsall Common, Coventry <br> </b> <br><i> Yes, their pervy pants, their windmills and their silly tasteless cheeses. Mind you, there are several brilliant things about Holland too - such as, er... Well, there aren't any mountains for a start, so there are no avalanche problems. And, er, well, there are the dykes of course - not that dykes are that brilliant really. Um, brilliant things about Holland, er... I've run out actually. <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> GOT A NEW MOTOR</b></font><br> Just bought the August ish and I liked the article on cars (page six). Here are my thoughts on the matter. Firstly, how to annoy a Porsche driver. I bought an Escort RS Turbo, got it 're-chipped' (ie got the turbo boosted by changing the engine management chip and making a few modifications). I now leave Porsche drivers (a contradiction in terms) wallowing in the dust at traffic lights. If you really want to suss them out, buy a second-hand Sierra Cosworth (at 220 BHP, the most powerful car on the road - power steering, no turbo lag... paradise). 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Onto the Triumph Herald - another name for 'rust'. (How's yer chassis, Davey?) As regards why Volvo Estates have all-day lights - it's law (well, in Sweden it is). In Britain it just says "Watch out, there's a green-wellied prat about". Vauxhall Cavaliers - I must say that I've got a lot more respect for these since I saw one beat two BMW M3's at Thruxton last Bank Holiday - but, having said that, it's still a Vauxhall. Ford Cortinas are prone to rear suspension problems due to the misuse of the back seat when parked up 'Lover's Lane'. The Mk1 and Mk2 are okay, but you can forget the Mk3 - buy a Capri instead and put a three-litre Granada engine in it. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minis, then. Mock ye not. An okay little car which can be made, relatively inexpensively, to move very quickly. Ideal, so long as you don't mind being eyeball-to-eyeball with lorry wheels. I agree about the Allegro - Italian for fast??? What a joke. You forgot about the Maxi though. The Renault Five - what's yours called? "A * &% ^ * &$" probably, when it doesn't start from hot or cold (secret is to use full choke and <i>not</i> to put your foot on the accelerator). A bit tinny, but not a bad motor. I could go on all day, but you probably haven't got enough room. <br> <b> Don Griffith <br> Hammersmith, London <br> </b> <br><i> David's Herald chassis is in perfect nick, thank you very much. (It's all the other bits that are crap.) <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> BLIMEY - HE'S BACK</b></font><br> You may groan and curse, but I am writing again. Why? Well, first of all I would like to thank Mr PJ Breolin for his support and encouragement which I greatly value. It's nice to know that there is someone out there who thinks as I do. Also I would like to answer some of Matthew Zavian's questions... 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) "Who am I?" I'm a schoolboy from Dorset. My hobbies are writing essays and computer programs, and drawing cartoons. I'm a vegetarian and a reviewer and head of the tips department on a fanzine called <i>Frisbee User</i>. I own a 48K Spectrum and have access to about 20 Beebs. And b) oh - there isn't another one, so that rounds off the letter. I make one final plea - please stop the swearing! <br> <b> Sam Jeffreys <br> Poole, Dorset <br> </b> <br><i> Well, well, well. I didn't think I'd be hearing from you again. Hmm, you've lost that fanatical tone you had a few issues ago, so well done. But about this swearing accusation - what on earth are you on about? You must have led a rather sheltered life if you think words like "blooming" and "blinking" are rude. If you were complaining about sexual innuendo then I'd be with you (but I still wouldn't necessarily agree). <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> JOB DESCRIPTIONS</b></font><br> Could I possibly have any information on jobs and what each person does, because I think <i>Your Sinclair</i> is the best Spectrum magazine - and I want a job in journalism. <br> <b> Chris Fagan <br> Runcorn, Cheshire <br> </b> <br><i> Well, this differs from magazine to magazine, but I'll clue you up on the </i>Your Sinclair<i> approach... 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Editor</b> This post involves gossiping on the telephone a lot - the more time you spend doing this, the better an Editor you are. I'm actually very good at it and score an A+. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Art Editor</b> You have to try to remove all the words from the magazine and replace them with pictures and artwork. The Editor (when he's not on the phone) has to try and stop you. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Production Editor</b> You have to be good at woodwork, because the </i>YS<i> shed is in a constant state of disrepair - and one of your duties is to stop leaks. You also have to be a sex machine. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Staff Writer</b> You have to do everything that no-one else can be bothered to do (probably why we're still looking for one - there you go). <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> CUNNING CODE</b></font><br> Where shall I <i>star</i>t? It was a very <i>star</i>ry night, my room was lit up by <i>star</i>light and I was <i>star</i>ing at a stark screen with my trusty pet, <i>Star</i>board the <i>star</i>ling. (I call him that 'cos he leans to the right.) I was bored, what should I do? Should I play <i><a href="50bestspeccygames94.htm">Starion</a></i> or <i>Starstrike</i> - or should I go for <i>star</i>dom and <i>star</i>tle a few of my friends? All that deep thinking made me <i>star</i>ve, so I went to hunt the fridge. Nothing alas, only a dead <i>star</i>fish - my stupid brother had put it in there along with a <i>star</i>ched shirt (strange, my bro). <br> <b> R Stevens <br> Saundersfoot, Dyfed <br> </b> PS You're a <i>star</i>. <br> <br><i> I've got a sneaking suspicion that you're hinting at something, but I can't for the life of me work out what it is. Andy says it's totally obvious, but won't let me in on the secret. Damn. Right, it's obviously some sort of a code - some of the letters are written in a different style of text to the others. What I'll do is take the letters immediately following the italics and stitch them together. Maybe they'll make some sort of message. Here goes. 'TRLKBLISDTFC'. Oh dear, that seems to be an anagram, and I'm no good at anagrams. Sorry. <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <TABLE align=center BORDER BGCOLOR=white BACKGROUND=""><TR><TD> <FONT SIZE=6><B><U>STAR LETTER</U></b></font><br><font size=4><b> AUSSIE BLUES</b></font><br> Last month I went on holiday to Australia. On the plane I was so bored and depressed because, yes, had forgotten to take my <i>YS</i>. Then my great old mum pulled something out of her bag. It was a copy of <i>YS</i>. I was really happy until I saw which one it was, because it was an old one I'd read before. Still, <i>YS</i> is so brilliant I read it again (and again). When I finally got to my hotel room down under I unpacked and, lo and behold, what was in it? The latest issue of <i>YS</i>. The one I thought I'd forgotten. So I settled down on my bed and read it from cover to cover. <br> <b> Angela Jackson <br> Stamford, Lincs <br> </b> <br><i> Once you'd finished it, I'll hazard a guess that the rest of the holiday was a bit of an anti-climax. Ooh, and how's about telling us what's happening in </i><a href="neighbours.htm">Neighbours</a><i>? (Or I won't send you your three games.) <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> </td></tr></table><p> <font size=4><b> RACCOONSTICK</b></font><br> I am writing to you to see if you could help me. I'm a 15-year-old schoolboy and I am now starting my GCSE Technology course. In the section I have chosen I am required to design something to help me in one of my favourite hobbies. I have chosen to design a computer joystick, and I was wondering if you could give me any information you have on what you would consider the perfect joystick (design, size, weight). <br> <b> Dean Garnham <br> Lowestoft, Suffolk <br> </b> <br><i> I'll give it my best shot. Well, when you're designing something from scratch you have to ask yourself what features are currently unavailable from other manufacturers. It springs to mind that there are no joysticks in the shape of raccoons, and I absolutely love raccoons, so let's take it from there. A raccoon-shaped joystick then. Right - the tail could be the shaft, and you could make the eyes and ears into tiny fire buttons. Little suction cups could go under the feet so it would adhere to a table-top. You wouldn't want to spoil the aesthetics with a clumsy cable though, so it would need to be an infra-red jobbie. Design finished, now for a snappy name. Er, how about 'The Disney Raccoontroller'? A bit naff, I know, but stick on a couple of TM's and it'd probably be a winner. <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> SHE'S MAD</b></font><br> Hello, I'm an English <i>YS</i> fan and I have to protest. How dare Kevin Berthier insult the most talented, fantastic, wonderful, amazing, luscious, gorgeous girl in the entire universe, Vanessa Paradis??!! It's a disgrace. Kevin doesn't think that the French are weird, but manages to insult the most good-looking girl ever, who happens to be French! With regard to the French being weird, I tend to agree with you and Dunc. They are weird. (Except Vanessa Paradis, of course.) <br> <b> Antony <br> Torquay, Devon <br> </b> <br><i> While I agree that Vanessa is something of a babe, I have to disagree with you on the not-being-weird front. Did you know that she wears her shoes on the wrong feet? It's a true 'pop fact'. She claims that it's because her big toes splay out too far, and she's trying to force them back into a more sensible position. I personally fall into the 'she's a bit slippy in the head' camp. Gorgeous, but bonkers. <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <TABLE align=center BORDER BGCOLOR="#208020" BACKGROUND=""><TR><TD><center><font size=6><b>THE WONDERFUL WORLD OF SPECCY</b></font></center><p> <b>Which country has never made it into the Wonderful World Of Speccy column?

Yeah, they don't sell <i>YS</i> over here - you ought to be ashamed of yourselves. I know my writing's very bad, but I would have typed it (the letter) but my sister put a disk in our Amiga and it got stuck! Even worse she got a knife to put in the disk drive now the computer is bust (and she wants to be a doctor). I have a Speky or else I wouldn't have bought the mag! My Speky is a 48K so it's quite crap to tell the truth. If anybody has a 128K which I could buy for 20 pounds (or less if possible) write now. I haven't read <i>YS</i> for a long time so sorry. But I went over to my friend's house and thought they were crap. When I went to England I bought myself one and ever since my life hasn't been the same cos now I have &pound;1.70 less in my pocket. Let me introduce myself, oh what can I say apart from um that my name is Thomas Courth. <br> <b> Thomas Courth <br> Bergishgladbach, W Germany <br> </b> <br><i> I think your sister's going to make a fine doctor - she just needs a bit more practice, that's all. I'll send you our office +3 (which has got a knife stuck in the disk drive as well). If your sister can't remove it you'll sort of have a 'matching pair', which can be used as book-ends or something. <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> </td></tr></table><p> <font size=4><b> SWOON KING</b></font><br> It seems that you, Mr Bielby, have lost your swooning powers. So I, Dr Anthony 'He Who Marcus Berkmann Keeps Calling The Goat And If He Does Again I'll Kick Him In The Bum' Whitaker, aged 17, am here to offer help (if you give me the Star Letter). 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) Wear some really groovy shades and use a personal stereo. (And I don't mean crappy Oxfam jobbies!) 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Should you speak to a girl who used to "wibble at the knees" when she saw you, put a medium-frequency voice on. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) If you want, you could do a dance as you walked down the big streets. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4) If it's cold wear flares of bright colours - and if it's hot you have the option of wearing bermudas. <br> <b> Anthony <i>('The Goat'.

He explained the practical but not theoretical reason that objects cannot pass the speed of light. At high speed time slows down. Imagine you are in a spaceship travelling at high speeds. To measure the distance you have left to travel you send a pulse of light towards your destination and time its return. As time has slowed down it takes a less number of seconds to return. As the speed of light is constant, the distance must have shortened. As speed = distance/time your speed would be less than if the distance had remained constant. Of course, the faster you travel, the slower time becomes, the less the distance is and the slower your speed than if the distance was constant. Therefore the speed of light can never be reached. <br> <b> Mary 'Genius' Knapp <br> Kingston, Lewes <br> </b> <br><i> Time for a </i>YS<i> 'experiment' I think. We'll prove this once and for all. I'm holding a wet bar of soap, and what I'm going to do is throw it at Andy's head. If it gets tangled up in his hair we'll say that the speed of light can never be attained. If, however, it bounces off then we'll say that there is no restriction on an object's velocity and that Einstein got it all wrong. I'm going to throw it now. (Sound of Andy falling onto the floor as heavy bar of soap ricochets off his bonce and goes flying through the shed's open door.) Ha ha! Einstein was crap and you don't get a Trainspotter. <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> PRAT</b></font><br> I claim a Trainspotter for noticing a mistake in the July ish. In the Wonderful World Of Speccy column, Ingio Rutten's letter said "It would be very mice..." and in Padlo Marek's letter it said "Thank you very moch..." and in Romeo Nichifor's letter it said "Thunks..." Is it because they can't translate, because you can't translate or was it just a printing error? <br> <b> Michael Molloy <br> Co Armagh, N Ireland <br> </b> <br><i> Clot! They spelt them wrong - not me or the printers. It's one of the reasons they ended up in Wonderful World Of Speccy.

He could turn the Oxford Dictionary into a rap, so may I suggest that next time you get any 'short' lines like the one above, don't phone Pos, as I'm sure he has much better things to do than recite such little triflings. <br> <b> The Fantastic Flying Funk <br> Hove <br> Sussex <br> </b> <br><i> Pah!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Dear Bud <br>I was upset to read in your last column about the Rice Krispies inner bag idea. Why? Because I thought of one first! I know it's not the winning but the 'taking part' that counts but... Oh well, here it is. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To conserve water and also keep your hair in tip-top condition, place lots of open inner bags in your garden. These handy receptacles will trap water which you can then use to wash your hair with. Rain water is very rich in minerals and an ideal hair-washing medium. <br>Yours 'inner baggily' <br><b>J Thorpe, Bridlington</b> <p><i>Brilliant! What do you think, readers?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Dear Bud <br>I've always longed for the opportunity to send you a handy household tip or something, and now I can. You see, on a recent visit to Spain I spent my time eating Los Krispies De Arroz with rather horrid sterilised milk. This milk came in durable plastic bottles. Well, my grandad told me that in fact these bottles were indesctructible and that the more breakfast we eat cereal-wise the more of these bottles will start filling up the world. In a few years the whole world will be ankle-deep in sterilised milk bottles. Think of the consequences environment-wise as the oceans fill with bottles and, well, how can mankind survive submerged in plastic bottles!? How could anyone be so dumb to make these bottles? Please advise me, Bud - I'm losing sleep. <br>Yours very worriedly <br><b>Alan, Durham</b> <p><i>You're absolutely right - this is a problem more in my mum's field of specialisation.
