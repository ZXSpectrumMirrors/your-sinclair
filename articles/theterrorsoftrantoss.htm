<div>Hang on to your Speccies, 
here's the next essential 
adventure. Marketed by 
Ariolasoft, <i>The Terrors Of 
Trantoss</i> is written by the 
<i>RamJam Corporation</i>, the very 
same people who brought us 
the wonderful <i><a href="adventuregreats.htm">Valkyrie 17</a></i>. 
And if you're wondering 
whatever happened to that 
game's follow-up, which was 
meant to deal with certain 
caperings in Carpathia, 
then you'll just have to carry 
on wondering - this game 
certainly ain't it. Comparing 
<i>Trantoss</i> to RamJam's earlier 
effort is like comparing 
champagne to Lucozade - 
and remember how good the 
Lucozade was. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Trantoss</i> is due out in late April, so <i>should</i> be out by the 
time you read this - but we all know how 'flexible' release 
dates can be, and my review copy is only a pre-produetion 
version. If the adventure is available, though, all I can say is 
go out and get it - it's a beaut! 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's also choc-a-bloc with those funny names so beloved of 
adventure programmers, names like Hapshal, Mortran, Scarn 
and Xyradd. Now can you guess which is one of the heroes 
and which is the name of a range of dark mountains? Okay, 
well here goes the scenario: south of the dark mountains of 
Mortran, in the region of Hapshal, lies a small village that 
doesn't seem to have a funny name at all, though it does 
have its problems - mainly the fact that it's slowly 
disappearing. Well, not the village itself, just the villagers, a 
few at a time, each night, and from behind locked doors as 
well. Sinister doings are afoot. Either that or Paul Daniels is 
rehearsing his next series there! 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sinister doings are not unconnected with a Xyradd 
called Trantoss, who's an evil old thing. In fact he's very old. 
Well, not to put too fine a point on it, he's undead. He was 
banished to far off mountains by the Wizards of Vane, who, 
rather unfortunately, are now just plain dead. The source of 
Trantoss's evil power was a golden mace that was smashed 
and scattered by the Wizards, but current happenings suggest 
that Trantoss must have been re-maced. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you think happens now? Enter the intrepid 
adventurer, to sort things out, right? Wrong! Enter two 
intrepid adventurers, who have woken up one morning to 
find the rest of the family missing. The survivors are Lobo 
the woodcutter, who's big but not exactly mastermind of 
Hapshal, and his brother, Scarn, who's a bit of a scoundrel 
and pretty nimble with it. You control both players, which 
introduces a few interesting commands into the regular 
adventure language. The characters can move either together 
or independently. At the start they move together but the 
command PART will cause them to move separately, JOIN 
will reunite them provided they're both in the same location, 
and SWAP enables you to change control from one to the 
other, no matter where they are. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The screen layout has the graphics down the left-hand 
side. Text scrolling up the right, with a band in between on 
which you see Lobo and Scarn. The one you're currently 
controlling is indicated in yellow, with his oppo in green if 
he's in the same location and blue if elsewhere. The graphics 
are beautifully detailed and they change instantly as you 
move or as you swap between characters. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brothers begin in the village street, with a tavern, a 
store, a house and a route west all visible. I made the tavern 
my first port of call where, naturally, a darkly clad stranger 
looked at me from under his hat. A strange place to keep his 
eyes, I thought, but never mind; he offered to guide me 
through the Forest of Gondin for a fee. Could he perhaps be 
talking through his hat? Not that it mattered as I was fee-less 
anyway. Back to the street and into the house, where I found 
a few useful objects. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vocabulary looked fairly 
promising, too, as IN and 
ENTER HOUSE both worked, 
while in the store I was 
offered all the supplies I might 
need for my trip by a kindly 
storekeeper. Not having a list 
of commands I thought GET 
ALL was worth a try, and 
blow me, it worked, although I 
later found a (pre-production?) 
bug in the routine. The 
objects have different weights 
attributed to them, and the 
GET ALL command goes 
through the objects in order till 
it finds one that makes you 
exceed your weight limit. It 
then tells you that you can't 
carry any more, but in fact 
there may be lighter objects 
listed after the heavier one that you can pick up if you take 
them individually. I also tried to PUT BLANKET IN SACK, 
though that only resulted in me dropping the blanket. Slightly 
irritating but not disastrous. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are so many goodies on offer at the store that I 
made my first SWAP and loaded up both brothers, but still 
had to leave things behind. Back at the tavern I was pleased 
to see the dark stranger hadn't done a bunk and so a bargain 
was struck. He then took us through hidden forest paths 
(and just you try to find them if he's not with you!), to the 
edge of a rocky ravine where he planted his staff in the 
ground, winked and disappeared. Ravine mad, obviously. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As well as adding another dimension to maze mapping, 
having two different characters adds to the complexities of 
problem solving, too. Back at the well with the crumbling 
rope, which had mysteriously reappeared, would it be any 
easier if the nimbler Scarn tried climbing down the rope? 
Nope! Perhaps the dog's only scared of Lobo. Or perhaps 
Scarn would be quick enough to throw the blanket over it? 
Who's got the blanket, Lobo or Scarn? And so your 
thoughts go. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for me, I went back to the ravine to try to cross that 
and see if there's anything corny like an old bone lying 
around to help me catch this wretched dog. I found getting 
over to the other side not too tricky. Though getting back is 
slightly different. But once you've got there you encounter 
the Gates of Ganreth... hang on, let me check my list of 
funny names... no, haven't come across that one before. 
Who or what or where is Ganreth? And how to open the 
gates, which are naturally locked? Though I could part, join 
and swap my two characters, I couldn't get them to stand on 
each other's shoulders. At this point a quick peek at the 
cheat sheet was called for. That told me I was on the wrong 
track and I'd need to solve elsewhere before going through 
the gates and encountering the fanglizard that was waiting 
for me on the other side. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back at the ravine I made Lobo wait while Scarn went off 
to explore some of the as-yet unmapped forest paths. But he 
only found himself back at the village where we began and 
with no hidden paths to enable him to return to the ravine. 
Lobo felt a bit lonely, and though he carried on for a while 
while Scarn made sure everything in the village had been 
explored, Lobo soon rcalised that he wasn't going to get 
through this adventure alone and QUIT. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The Terrors Of Trantoss</i> is a really delightful adventure, 
and despite the few vocabulary faults it is generally quick to 
respond. I'm looking forward to more time with it than this 
quick preview allowed. Good graphics, and plenty of those 
humorous and detailed little touches that made <i><a href="adventuregreats.htm">Valkyrie 17</a></i> 
stand out from the crowd of hum-drum adventure releases.
