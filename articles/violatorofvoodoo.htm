<div>Pulsating lights, searing 
pain, re-birth into 
another dimension or 
place - it can all only mean one 
thing: the Traveller In Black is 
back again! Last time Phoenix, 
the game's main character, 
had to save the village of 
Finvarra from the evil clutches 
of the hell-spawned 
Abomination. Needless to say 
the sequel is suitably tougher 
and there's a whole island of 
innocent souls to save! 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The game begins with a 
reminder that after you 
were murdered, 
(before the beginning 
of the first 
adventure) you were 
mysteriously 
recruited into the ranks 
of the eternal 
champions known as the 
Time Crusaders. You are 
told that Fmvarra was the 
first battleground and that 
Santa Barbaro is the last. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You'd be wise to read the 
detailed notes concerning 
voodoo rituals, there are a lot 
of terms, phrases and names to 
mull over. Luckily, they are all 
explained when you come 
across them, so you don't need 
to understand them all to 
enjoy the adventure. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the time you've read the 
<I>Voodoo</I> notes and braced 
yourself for the challenges to 
come, you'll see that you're 
standing on a golden, sandy 
beach. Things don't seem too 
bad, and exploration of the 
surroundings suggests that the 
place has been calmly 
evacuated rather than ravaged 
by all manner of nasty 
thingies. Further beach-combing, however, proves that 
there are foul deeds afoot as 
you spy a many-legged wotsit 
slithering off with some tasty 
human morsel tucked under 
one appendage. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voodoo part of the 
games title is derived from the 
fact that the entire islands 
inhabitants seem to be devout 
believers in that particular 
mysterious art. Both you and 
the Abomination should be 
well at home on Santa 
Barbaro. After all, you've been 
brought back from the dead, 
and the Abomination devours 
the souls of anything remotely 
alive or dead. Surprisingly 
though, it 
turns out 
that you are 
not expected 
to personally 
do battle with the 
Abomination! Your job is 
to do the bidding of the 
Mambo Miracia - the 
priestess around whom 
the game actually 
revolves. She's the 
one whose 
commands you 
should slavishly 
follow if you want to 
make progress. Luckily, 
Miracia likes simple 
conversation and, after a 
polite greeting, she should 
be able to point you in the 
right direction. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking of the right 
direction, the island is quite 
large so I suggest you map it 
as you go. I was glad to see 
that sudden deaths seem to 
have no place in the game and 
neither do time limits, so 
you're free to wander and map 
in relative safety. As you 
explore you'll hear the chants 
of the entranced islanders: 
"Papa Legba, la plus par 
tombe." But don't let that 
frighten you! 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keep a cool head, do the 
Mambo's bidding and you'll 
amass several useful items. 
Nearly everything in the 
game has a purpose so 
discard nothing and take 
note of the interiors of 
the huts you come 
across. Examine 
everything, search 
everything and look 
under everything for 
optimum results! 
The game's 
vocabulary seems to be 
large enough to let you 
ask questions and 
manipulate objects in a 
variety of ways that all mean 
the same thing. This means 
that you don't have to muck 
about searching for the exact 
words. This is an adventure 
that's definitely in the 'get 
object X to help overcome 
problem Y and the result is 
situation Z' mould of 
adventuring. The factual 
details in the game have been 
well researched though they 
are, on occasions, rather 
slavishly adhered to. The 
upshot of this is that you feel 
compelled to write down 
everything you're told which 
can lead to the game losing 
some of its urgency. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the time 
I'd reached
45% (score) I 
was sure I was
nearing the end,
but that's when the game 
really takes off and the Mambo 
and her voodoo pals start to 
expect you to do more and 
more for them. I soon 
discovered that the 45% I'd 
scored had been accumulated 
by going for the easy pickings 
and that there was plenty 
more of the game still to see. 
As you continue to play, and 
the end grows ever closer, 
you'll uncover more evidence of 
the Abomination's presence 
and will be itching to get your 
hands on it. When you do you 
can give it a darn good 
thrashing for upsetting the 
cozy, simplistic lifestyle of the 
islanders. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graphics, sound and fancy 
screen effects have no place in 
this game, neither are they 
necessary - for it's the actual 
content that counts here. It's 
all very well put together and 
the quests you find yourself 
undertaking range from fairly 
easy to fairly hard/unusual. 
My only gripe is that the 
ending is far too swift and a bit 
predictable. It's nowhere near 
as good as <I><a href="phoenix.htm">Phoenix</a></I>, which had 
one of the best final outcomes 
of any adventure I've ever 
played. What's more, there are 
too few challenges and not
enough barriers are put in 
your way. This means that if 
you miss a clue or an item at a 
certain location, you'll have to 
retrace your steps right across 
the length or breadth of the 
playing area, before having to 
go back and continue your 
quest. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, leaving aside those 
minor gripes, you're left with 
another fine example of a 
serious, yet playable, 
adventure by an 
author who
knows how to
entertain
and educate
at the same
time.
