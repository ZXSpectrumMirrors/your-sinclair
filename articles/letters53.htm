<b> I'm in quite a good mood this month, believe it or not. Yes, the air down here in Bath is really rattler calming - and our shed's been done up a bit. There's a skylight in the roof now, so the warm Spring air can sort of waft through (or it would if we could get the skylight open). Anyway, I suppose I'd better deal with you lot. Off we go then... </b> <p> <font size=4><b> KEYBOARD CAPERS</b></font><br> I have been buying (and reading) <i>YS</i> for two to three years now - it's incredible! I've got a subscription and I would strongly recommend everyone to get one. But I would like to know one thing - do you playtest the games on the Speccy keys? It looks like it to me. In the March issue, in the review of <i><a href="garfield.htm">Garfield</a></i>, Jackie said "left-right pummelling the keyboard", not "joystick waggling". Why? Can't you afford joysticks, or do you just not like them? <br> <b> Robert Porter <br> Halton, Lancs <br> </b> PS Stop giving us northerners hassle - our arcades are only 10p. So shut up. <br> <br><i> We've got nothing against joysticks, it's just that there isn't a model available small enough for Jackie - she has to use the keyboard (and even then we have to sellotape planks of wood to her arms to give them added weight so she presses the keys firmly). There's no way around it. And as for giving northerners hassle, what do you expect? Serves you right for living at the crap end of the country. <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> DILLON OF DOCK GREEN</b></font><br> I was reading <i>Joystick Jugglers</i> in ish 51 when I caught a glimpse of a new bloke called Tony Dillon. The name sounded familiar, and so did his mug. Reading through my friend's copy of, er, 'wotsit' I spotted his name again and the thought struck me that they might be one and the same. Are they the same? And if they are, has Tony seen the light and decided to work for the best Speccy mag this side of the solar system? I'd like to know. <br> <b> Jeremy Lee <br> Slade Green, Kent <br> </b> <br><i> Yes, he is one and the same. I let him do some stuff for us out of the kindness of my heart (you know how kind I am by now, I'm sure). Unfortunately, coming from the 'other' camp (as he does) he was a bit crap. <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> DEAD RENEGADE</b></font><br> Firstly I'd like to congratulate you on reaching the big 50. Did you know you shared your 50th issue with my goldfish's 50th birthday? It's true. For its birthday I bought it one of those multi-coloured Cruiser Joysticks. When it saw its pressie it had a heart attack and died. I'm going to miss old Renegade. We enjoyed so many computer games together, like <i><a href="bubblebobble-69.htm">Bubble Bobble</a></i> and <i><a href="operationthunderbolt.htm">Operation Thunderbolt</a></i>. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since he's gone nothing's gone right. Firstly during a drama lesson, when we weren't wearing any shoes or socks, someone sat down on their chair - and one of its legs was on my toe. It's now broken (my toe, that is). Secondly, the Saturday after the toe episode, I stood up under an open cupboard and lost a chunk of my eyebrow. Moan moan moan. <br> <b> Emma Edwards <br> Harlow, Essex <br> </b> <br><i> As well as a badge, I'm going to send you a replacement goldfish. He's called Arnold and is, as I was assured by the assistant in the pet shop, an extremely 'lucky' fish. I'll just squeeze him into the Jiffy bag. (Heave, grunt.) There. Now to staple it closed. </i>(Oh no! Arnold)<i> Righto, onto the 'Post Out' pile with it. Arnold should be with you in a few days. <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> THE ART OF DECEPTION</b></font><br> In the August '89 issue of your illustrious organ you published a letter written by my father, who was pretending to be me - he'd boasted that he could get a letter published using my name, so I called his bluff. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In your reply, also published in that issue <i>(Obviously. Ed)</i>, you told him/me that he/we couldn't have your Spectrum manual and that he/we/me would "have to make do with a badge". Well, I/me have been waiting expectantly ever since. Give us a break. Give us/me/him a badge! <br> <b> Keith Ramsay <br> Hartshill, Stoke-on-Trent <br> </b> <br><i> How do I know that you're not your dad pretending to be you again? That's the trouble with deception - you never know where it ends. Still, never mind, I've got TWO spanky badges in my hand and I'm about to drop them into an envelope for you. (Unless of course I'm pretending to - in which case I haven't got two badges in my hand which I'm not about to drop into an envelope. You'll have to wait and see.) <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> HE'S DISGUSTED</b></font><br> I am not writing to you with any game cheats or to say how wonderful your mag is. I am writing to tell you what I think about it. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is disgraceful, and it is shocking to know that it is the number one Sinclair magazine. You seem to delight in putting in swear-words, dirty articles, horrible pictures, sarcasm and reviews of evil games plus demos of dreadful rubbish like <i><a href="alteredbeast.htm">Altered Beast</a></i> (I think this is the most disgusting and evil game I have ever seen). Computing is an art and a science, not an excuse for disgraceful material to be published. Please stop - you are blackening the name of Sinclair. <br> <b> Sam Jeffreys <br> Poole, Dorset <br> </b> <br><i> Oh. Tell you what I'll do. I'll drop the swear-words, innuendo, articles, horrible pictures, sarcasm and all game reviews. And I'll rename the mag </i>Bunty<i>. Actually I'll go further than that. I'm going to close the magazine down totally. I'm going to sell up and move to Canada, where I'm going to live in the forest (like they do in Disney films) and make friends with all the animals there. I'll have a pet racoon called Ricky or something. Together we'll ward off an attacking grizzly bear. It's going to be brilliant. <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> VICIOUS SWEDE</b></font><br> Oh God! No! Now you're all dead meat! Especially the %@$&pound;%$* on the Ed's chair. Yeah, you heard me! The %@$&pound;%$* on the Ed's chair! Last time I wrote to your mag (the best mag in the galaxy) I got my letter printed, but I didn't get my <i>YS</i> badge! Now I'm really A*$$%6 off! And I have followed your last advice, and have a big doctor bill for my broken collar bone! Maybe I'm coming to England this summer to visit London (and <i>YS</i> of course). Then the Ed's head will be rolling on the street like a football in a soccer game. But you can avoid this one way and one way only! That way is by sending me my <i>YS</i> badge and print my letter now! <br> <b> Kent Carlsson <br> Helsingborg, Sweden <br> </b> PS If you're bored ignore this letter. <br> <br><i> God, I'm so incredibly bored. Yawn! Er, I think I'll make a little tower out of some matches. No, that's boring as well. I know - I'll have a kip instead. Zzzzzz. <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> PLUCKY PENSIONER</b></font><br> I went round my mate's house to play <i><a href="chasehq.htm">Chase HQ</a></i> because he couldn't get past Stage One and asked me to try. Well, what can I say? I did it first go. I liked the game so much I decided to get a copy, so jingle jangle, scrunch scrunch, I got out my dosh and went out to buy it. A couple of weeks later I'd completed it with a score of 11630065. Later on I showed it to my granny (who's 70) and she also loved it. She's very weak-hearted, but still played it all day while I was at school and then she completed it with a score of 11451293. <i><a href="chasehq.htm">Chase HQ</a></i> is a mega-fab game that I would recommend to any pensioner. <br> <b> Jack Gallagher <br> Langley, Slough <br> </b> <br><i> There wouldn't be much point recommending it to my great uncle Basil (a pensioner of 82). He suffers from senile dementia, you see, and doesn't really know where he is most of the time. Give him a joystick and sit him in front of a Speccy and he'd probably think he was at the greengrocers or in the middle of the Battle of the Ardennes (or something). <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> DECISIONS DECISIONS</b></font><br> I'm 14 and this year I have to choose the subjects which will be my GCSE exams. For example, if I choose Computer Studies it will become a GCSE exam when I'm in the fifth year. So the subjects I choose this year will be on my timetable next year. What I want to know is what qualifications do you need to become a journalist working in computer mags? My dad says you have to be a moron, but I think I'd value your opinion more. <br> <b> Martin Betts <br> Norwich, Norfolk <br> </b> <br><i> Oh dear. I don't know how to break this to you, but your dad was right. <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> PEE SEA SHOW</b></font><br> I've got a bit of a complaint about you lot. Now it's all very well having these PC and Games Shows every once in a while, but why are they always in the London area? How about having one up in the north-east of England for a change? Or even better, why not have a <i>YS</i> Roadshow? I am sure this would please a lot of people who just can't afford the time or money to trek all the way down south and all the way back again. I hope this seems like a good idea to you - and if not, well, it was worth the try, wasn't it? <br> <b> Ken Pedelty <br> Glebe, Washington <br> </b> <br><i> Yes it was. And you'll be pleased to know that we're even thinking of taking you up on that </i>YS<i> Roadshow idea - the trouble is, where would be fair for everybody? Tell you what I'll do, I'll close my eyes and stick a pin in the UK page of the </i>YS<i> atlas for a random location. Here goes. Er, oh. I'm afraid the </i>YS<i> Roadshow is going to take place in the North Sea, half way between Wick and the Shetland Islands. <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <TABLE align=center BORDER BGCOLOR=white BACKGROUND=""><TR><TD> <FONT SIZE=6><B><U>STAR LETTER</U></b></font><br><font size=4><b> BLIMEY- IT'S FROM RUMANIA</b></font><br> Honoured Sir, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all I must introduce myself - my name is Antal Burjon, and I am a 20 years old boy. I live in Rumania, the country of enormous changes in the last few months. In fact these changes determinates me to write you in the following problem. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a few years I am interested in finding out as much as possible about home computers and, generally, about computer sciences. I possess my own wonderful Spectrum +128K, and I'd like to turn to a bigger machine. As there is no documentation and programs for other than Spectrum compatible computers - at least yet - I was forced to search for a +3 Spectrum. In vain. The old dictatorial government, wishing its own people not to think, has discouraged in all possible ways the entrance of the micros in the 'little red empire'. As I have got no millionaire aunt or uncle in the States, and there are no +3s in this country, then my dreams seem to be only... dreams. I decided to write to you when I saw the constant and substantial help given by your people for us. Please try to solve my problem sending me any piece of information of Spectrum range of micros, or programs, or anything else. Many many thanks, wishing you - and in fact for both of us - a happy new year, a happy new Europe. <br> <b> Burjan Antal <br> Medias Jud Sibiu, <br> Rumania <br> </b> <br><i> What I've done is printed your full address [snipped --NickH].

This month a rather odd dig at Michael Jackson from Malta and a ditty from one of Beelzebub's little helpers who lives in our favourite clog-making land - the land of the clog.

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Michael Jackson thinks he's cool, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to me he's just a fool, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his mouth was a silver spoon, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day that he was born. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thinks he's a Moonwalker, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think he's just a big talker. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Building a sanctuary for Liz, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who the hell does he think he is? <br> <b> Simon Freedman <br> Sliema, Malta <br> </b> <br><i> Why pull your punches? Here's my version of your poem...

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> GREETINGS FROM HELL</b></font><br> I'm gonna tell you about my problem whether you like it or not! I own a Speccy 128K and I own almost no games. This is because you can't buy Speccy games in the Netherlands anymore. So I went Satan and asked him what to do. And he said "Buy a Comrade 64 - enough games available." So I bought a Comrade 64 and own some games now. But I still like my Speccy, so maybe you can save this poor chap by giving him the Star Letter so he can get some software for his lovely Speccy. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be a God and save me from Satan.

At the top of the Madam Pico section you explain that she is on holiday and so her grandson Bud is taking her place. But in Bud's reply he says that his mum is on holiday at the moment. He can't be her grandson and son! <br> <b> D Bickford <br> Maldon <br> Essex <br> </b> <br><i> Bud was adopted by Madam Pico at an early age. Madam Pico's husband was then killed in an accident in a custard factory. Madam Pico's mother (Bud's grandmother) then passed away. Madam Pico's mother's husband (Eric) was not Madam Pico's real father - he was her stepfather. Madam Pico and Eric later fell in love while holidaying in Cleethorpes, and were eventually married. This makes Eric Bud's grandfather and Madam Pico herself both Bud's mother and his grandmother. No? Oh, alright - you can have a Trainspotter then. <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> IT RHYMES!</b></font><br> Well golly gosh and crikey dick, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You really are incredibly thick, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not three mistakes, not one but two, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have noticeably been done by you! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first was done by Dr B 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which in ish 46 you will see 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That an <i><a href="rtype.htm">R-Type</a></i> hint on page 49 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is printed for the second time. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first (just two of them, no more) 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was on page 36 of ish 44. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other mistake was in the Trainspotter part 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where you didn't show too much art 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In saying a front cover was just a reflection 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But can you not see the simple connection 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between what hand drive the car really was 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the basic scientific laws? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Namely if one part is back to front 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then you'd also have to shunt 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around the "Scoop 1" number plate 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which front-to-back wouldn't look too great! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So for pointing out both these errors

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd like a Trainspotter from you terrors. <br> <b> Alistair 'Robert Burns' Morrison <br> Banff, Scotland <br> </b> <br><i> In the country of Ciskei, the front number plates are required by law to read in mirror-image form (like the word 'AMBULANCE' on the front of, er, ambulances).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Dear Mr Pico, <br>I am writing to you as Head of the Monopolies Commission following complaints that you are guilty of biased and prejudicial reference to Rice Krispies. It is not only the constant reference to this cereal so much as your mention of only one brand, namely Kelloggs Rice Krispies. I look forward to reading your explanation on this matter. <br>Regards, <br>The Head of the Monopolies Commission <p><i>Blimey! Er... I'm not sure what you mean. Erm... I have no financial interest in the welfare of the rather excellent and nutritionally-balanced Kelloggs Rice Krispies at all. Uh... Just to prove this here's a reader's tip... </i> 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Dear Mr Pico <br>I read with interest your enquiry if any of your readers have cereal tips. I am a collector of porcelain and as I have many valuable pieces to store safely I usually pack my delicate treasures into a cardboard box filled with Slater's Puffy Rice. It really is an ideal medium for the safe storage of delicate heirlooms. I have tried using the Kellogg's variety but find that they are not as impact-resisitant as the Slater's brand. <Br>Yours, <br>Reg Slater (no relation) <p><i>Er, thanks for that tip, Mr Slater. I suspect, however, that you're motives for writing to me may not have been entirely 'above board' - your letter was typed on Slater's Breakfast Products stationary! No 'Bud Pico Taught Me How To Do It' badge for you, I'm afraid! <br>Cheers, <br>Bud</i> 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Dear Mr Pico, <br>I have recently earned my cookery badge at Brownies for making Chocolate Rice Krispie cakes. Is this a new 'breakfast cereal tip'? <br>Love, <br>Samantha, Pixie Six (aged seven) <p><i>Dear Samantha <br>They sound like a most delicious snack!! Not only have you earned yourself a Brownie cookery badge, but a 'Bud Pico Taught Me How To Do It' badge as well! (I hope Brown Owl lets you wear it on your uniform!) <br>Cheers, <br>Bud </i> </font></td></tr></table> <p> <TABLE BORDER=0 ALIGN=center VALIGN=center><tr><td align=right> <TABLE BORDER=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 bgcolor="black" background=""><TR bgcolor="black" background=""><TD><font size=2 color=white><i><b>Doodlebugs</b></i></font></td></tr> <tr><td bgcolor="black" background=""><a href="http://wos.meulie.net/pub/sinclair/./magazines/YourSinclair/Issue53/Doodlebugs/YS53Doodlebugs01.jpg"><IMG SRC="../thumbs/YS53Doodlebugs01.jpg" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=108 ALT="Doodlebugs"></a> </td></tr></table> </td><td></td></tr></table> <p>
