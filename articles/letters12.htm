&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yours in awe of the excellence of <i>Your Sinclair</i> (compared with Sugar User, Crush and Computer and Vegetable Games). <br> <b> Paul King <br> Wells, Somerset <br> </b> <br><i> Does this mean the house beer is called Willy Warmer? T'zer </i> <p> <font size=4><b> CHECKMATE</b></font><br> I can't tell you how pleased was to see that both <i>Colossus 4</i> and <i><a href="psichess.htm">Psi Chess</a></i> were reviewed in the October ish. But I was rather disappointed to find that the reviews were made by Gwyn who was honest enough to admit she was no chess player. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you think it would be possible to get your reviews done by people who at least have a reasonable knowledge of what they're reviewing. I'm quite sure you could have found some very willing chess reviewers from your local chess club. <br> <b> Simon Strange <br> Hassocks, West Sussex <br> </b> <br><i> Rachael would be very surprised to find that Gwyn is in fact a girl! It would be nigh on impossible to get reviewers who're experts on every game's content. How many Spectrum users are qualified pilots, gold medalists, Ninja warriors, Mermaids, members of the SAS? And if you can find the right person to review </i>Scoaby Doo<i> then you're a better man than I, well woman actually. On second thoughts don't answer that. <b>T'zer</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> CHOPSTUCKS</b></font><br> I recently purchased a copy of US Gold's <i><a href="kungfumaster.htm">Kung Fu Master</a></i> and to be quite frank my first impression of it was unprintable. After a few thousand games I got quite fond of it - until I carne face to face with the Guardian on the 4th floor. I had no option but to swing my leg landing a well-placed kick in the mid-region of the body - but to my complete horror his energy didn't deplete at all. Even worse another Guardian appeared at the rear, and no amount of punching and kicking would shift them. <br> <b> Stephen Martin <br> Glasgow, Scotland <br> </b> <br><i> Perhaps you should try a less violent approach. Talk to them. Try to understand their problems... help them come to terms with... (snip) <b>T'zer</b> Put the boot in, that's what I say. <b>Troubleshootin' Pete</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> BEARING UP?</b></font><br> This is a complaint!!!! You lot can breathe easy 'cos the mag is great. I'm writing to complain about the game <i><a href="bobbybearing.htm">Bobby Bearing</a></i> as I am now suffering from severe finger fatigue as a result of the game being naffed up. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It all started in the shop. First, I was given a game with a broken case - fair enough, they simply swapped it. I was just leaving the shop and shock, horror I realised I had no instructions so I had to go back and get them. I rushed back home, plugged it all in and selected the Kempston joystick option - imagine my surprise when everything stopped. I spent all afternoon trying to load it which it eventually did only after I'd removed the Turbo interface. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two weeks later I returned to the shop, or rather my mum did - we do live about 20 minutes away. I dug it out of the peas, bread and cheese and loaded it in. I chose the Kempston option again (sounds of nailbiting and hair tearing-out) and it died again. I finally looked at the instructions only to find there weren't any and that I'd cut my finger on the cracked cassette case. So for my &pound;7.95 I bought a naffed game and a large doctor's bill! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from that the game is very good and enjoyable to play. You can wake up now I've finished. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yours frustratingly, <br> <b> Philip Miller <br> Eaton Bray, Bedfordshire <br> </b> <br><i> Zzzzzzzzzzzzz... sorry did someone say something? <b>T'zer</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> CHEAP'N'CHEERFUL</b></font><br> <i>YS</i> brings me new hope. Apart from being one of the cheapest mags it is by far the best. I admit to buying other magazines but <i>YS</i> really takes the cake (as long as it isn't one of my mums - yeuurch!). <i>YS</i> is very colourful as well - not exactly a sunglasses job but it does catch the eye. And I like the POKEs - I'm not saying I cheat or anything but I wouldn't have completed half the games without them. Keep it up - the good work I mean. <br> <b> D J Morgan <br> Barnstable, Devon <br> </b> <br><i> You say the nicest things. <b>T'zer</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> GETTING SOME STICK</b></font><br> At last you managed to get away from the 'comic look' - no more weighty wrestlers, batty Batmen or gruesome Goblins. The September issue actually looked quite adult-ish but then I saw them... Yes, you guessed it - the stickers! Were these seven lousy stickers supposed to increase sales? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if so, did they? I reckon they were more of a deterrent to older people - no one wants to buy a magazine that appears childish. I must admit I felt a bit of a wally <i>(Which particular bit of a wally did you feel and did he mind? T'zer)</i> buying your magazine so how would older people feel? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the stickers were not intended to boost sales and were simply a gift to the readers, I'm sure there's something more relevant to the world of computers you could give away. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, nice mag, shame about the freebies. <br> <b> Ernie Ackers <br> Amersham, Lancashire <br> </b> <br><i> You don't think you're being a teensy-weensy bit stuck-up about this? The stickers were just meant to be a bit of freebie fun - if everything about computing had to be "serious" there wouldn't be much room left for most computer games and no-one would buy </i>YS<i>. And anyway, they were extremely relevant to computers. The only things holding our Speccy together now are the stickers on it. And while we're on the subject, I reckon a </i>YS<i> sticker spot would be a good idea. What's the oddest place you've seen a </i>YS<i> sticker? Oh, and the Ed doesn't count, odd as he is! <b>T'zer</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> DEER ED</b></font><br> My big uncal anthony sed i shud rite yoo an tell yoo ow nasstee an crool an uglee an reely nawty yoo arr.

My mum says that if I wake him up by the sound coming from my lovable Speccy then he'll give me a foot up the whereabouts and a thick ear. <br> <b> Ian Morrison <br> Fife, Scotland <br> </b> <br><i> The Speccy's sound keeps your dad awake? He's not the bionic man by any chance? It's probably just an excuse to give you a thick ear anyway.

That game doesn't deserve a mark of 1 let alone 8. It's full of bugs (well three), unrealistic, unresponsive and far too easy - I completed up to level 4 the day I got it. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking off - easy you say. Easy if you don't try to turn, dive or pull up below take-off speed - which is very high! Climbing is like swimming in treacle. In-flight refuelling? The one time I had enough fuel to reach the aircraft I collided with it even though I was a thousand feet above it. Big plane that tanker! And to cap it all there's the dreaded Lenslok with absolutely no instructions. I eventually took the game back in disgust.

Read The Demolished Man, a sci-fi book by someone whose name I've forgotten (I lost the book) and you'll see that the baddie Ben Reich has a code.

Course you're right but he makes absolutely no secret about it. <b>T'zer</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> NO BILL PRIZE</b></font><br> It is my considered opinion, (I'm 'Oirish so I should know) that the entire staff of <i>YS</i> have a combined IQ equal to that of an empty milk bottle without the milk. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for this unique attribute among magazine staff I reckon you wouldn't have the best compo mag around. Count yourself lucky! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yours in a nutshell, <br> <b> Bill Campbell <br> Dun Laoghaire, Dublin <br> </b> <br><i> If it's all the same to you Bill I'd rather not have mine in a nutshell thankyou. What I want to know is exactly what the difference in IQ is between an empty milk bottle and an empty milk bottle without the milk. Where did you say you came from? <b>T'zer</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> SIMON SAYS...</b></font><br> I've been reading your mag for some months now and enjoy it immensely. Nothing strange in that I hear you say (I'm using my imagination for this bit 'cos my hearing's not <i>that</i> good!), but I have never owned a Sinclair computer. I do have a Commodore but before you shoot me down in flames let me explain. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a voracious appetite for computer mags and read a number of other mags on a variety of computers. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Computers are not a fad - they are important. And don't listen to boring encyclopedia-wielding Anoraks. Playing games is fun and reason enough for owning a computer. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although gamesplaying isn't going to make you a highly paid business programmer it does at least make people feel comfortable in the vicinity of a computer and this 'some day computers will rule the world', 'the police have a computer that'll arrest a man and hang him in less than eight seconds' attitude will fade. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's it! Apart from, if you enjoy producing the mag half as much as I do reading it then it must be one hell of a place to work! <br> <b> Simon Sleightholm <br> Northumberland <br> </b> <br><i> It's certainly hell alright! <b>T'zer</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> GORDON BENNETT...</b></font><br> Well done, well done, well done, give away a bundle of T-shirts just as winter's coming up. Whoever thought it up should be given the 'Berk Of The Month' Award. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway I thought I'd try my hand - if I won I could aways wear the whole lot together. So, I cut out the coupon, stuck it to the back of a postcard and sent it off. Next morning I awoke to find... the postcard on my doormat. 'What is Castle Rathbone up to?' I thought. So I stuck on yet another stamp and posted it again. A few days later what do I find on my doormat, no not a bundle of T-shirts but the postcard!! Help! I can't get rid of it. What's up with the postman today? Why are they reading the back of postcards? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to be outdone I put another stamp on the card and tried a different postbox. So far so good but I can tell you I really dread looking at the doormat just in case it returns... <br> <b> E Bennett <br> London SW11 <br> </b> <br><i> Your postcard is winging it's way back to you right now. <b>T'zer</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> WE ARE NOT AMUSED</b></font><br> The 'Devlin' has just seen Craig Gallacher's pathetic letter and I'm not amused. How can you publish such guff? He states that I should be in a loony-bin when he, surprise, surprise, wears a Transformer watch and puke, puke, cords with, wait for it, <i>flares</i>! How mental can you get? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yours disgusted, <br> <b> Mark Devlin <br> Ayrshire, Scotland <br> </b> <br><i> How can we publish such guff? Easy! We've just done it. Anyway, I rather like Transformer watches and the Ed always wears flared cords.
