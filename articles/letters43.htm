<b> Just a quick note to introduce myself formally. I'm your new Ed, <i>Matt Bielby</i>. Um. Well, that's it really. As you probably know (if you read last month's <i>Psst</i> properly) T'zer's still around (in the next office, to be precise) and she's kindly offered to help me through my first Letters pages - but I'll be more or less on my own next time, so let's hope I get the idea. Anyway, here we go... </b> <p> <font size=4><b> GOLDEN ANNIVERSARY</b></font><br> As you know, the February 1990 issue of <i>Your Sinclair</i> will be the 50th edition of the magazine. I hope you are thinking of some very special features to put in it, such as a mega-mega-compo or free gift. I think it would be a great idea if, for this one very special issue, EVERY SINGLE PAGE of the mag could be printed in glorious technicolour! I'm sure your readers would appreciate this a lot. Maybe you could have a competition in the next few months in which readers are asked to think of something to include in the 50th ish - however funny, bizarre or serious the ideas are. Perhaps the winner could receive a bumper <i>YS</i> 'goodie' bag. <br> <b> Robert Wilkins <br> Llangunnor, Dyfed <br> </b> <br><i> That's an absolutely terrible idea! <b>Ed</b>.

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...There is no Sainsburys in Shrewsbury. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just thought I'd let you know! <br> <b> Mark Betton <br> Shrewsbury, Shropshire <br> </b> <br><i> Yes there is - in Church Street! <b>Ed</b>. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He won't buy that, he actually lives there - look at his address. <b>T'zer</b>. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh yes. Sorry. Um, yes, there most certainly isn't a Sainsburys in Shrewsbury. Take note, David Taylor. <b>Ed</b>. </i> <p> <TABLE align=center BORDER BGCOLOR=white BACKGROUND=""><TR><TD> <FONT SIZE=6><B><U>STAR LETTER</U></b></font><br><font size=4><b> COLLAR'S BEEN 'FELT'</b></font><br> Firstly thanks for putting an adventure game on the free tape (issue 41). Why? Well, because I couldn't play any arcade games as my left hand is in a flippin' sling - I've got a broken collarbone. I haven't got a joystick, and using the keyboard to play <i><a href="operationwolf.htm">Oppo Wolf</a></i> with one hand is a bit of a joke. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did you break your collarbone, I hear you cry? <i>(I didn't actually, but you're obviously going to tell us anyway. Ed)</i> 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I went to my friend's to get a back issue (40) which he'd borrowed from me - and while I was there his brother asked me out for a game of footie. After five minutes in the goal I noticed a leather sphere coming toward me so I dived out to meet it - at the same time as somebody else. Next thing I know I'm on the ground in agony. And to make matters worse I had to push my bike home. So now you know why I like adventure games, how I broke my collarbone and why I'm not too pleased with <i>YS</i> issue 40. <br> <b> Daniel Curran <br> Meadaragh, Co. Donegal <br> </b> PS Your mag is brill (except for issue 40 that is). <br> <br><i> Ooooh, don't blame issue 40, blame a) the rum old 'sport' of 'footie' and b) your mate's brother. Still, not only do you get a badge to pin on your sling - you also get three free games. The painful walk home with your bike paid off. <b>Ed</b>. </i> <p> </td></tr></table><p> <font size=4><b> STRING'EM UP</b></font><br> Shock. Horror. I am writing to tell you that you have a traitor in your midst. Phil South has gone and got himself a nice little earner on the side writing a column for <i>Computer Shopper</i>. Nothing too bad there, but the column is entitled Mi Amiga (spit curse)! He is not alone though, for in the very same magazine your own 'Macca' McCandless reviews games for the Atari ST <i>and</i> the Amiga. These two so-called journalists should be hung, drawn and quartered for even daring to be unfaithful to the Speccy. <br> <b> Stephen Barclay <br> Bearsden, Glasgow <br> </b> <br><i> It's a different Phil South and David McCandless. Pure coincidence. <b>Ed</b>. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You don't honestly expect anyone to believe that do you? <b>T'zer</b>. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually we share offices with </i>Computer Shopper<i> and they're always nicking our staff to do bits and pieces. Just shows how brilliant we are really, doesn't it? <b>Ed</b>. </i> <p> <font size=4><b> NOT TOO IMPRESSED</b></font><br> What is happening to <i>Your Sinclair</i>? The quality of this magazine has been swiftly going downhill over the last few months. It's like the Sun Readers' Guide To Computing and if it continues at its present rate will be no better than the <i>Sunday Sport</i>. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you ever sit back and look at what you're now printing? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) The <i>Input/Output</i> page is full of rubbish like 'Eight year old blonde female would like to meet sexy he-men aged three years and over for a good time'. (Maybe this is exaggerated a little, but you know what I mean.) 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) <i>Program Pitstop</i>! What was a really good section is now full of mistakes. Have you looked at the May '89 issue and typed in the first part of <i>The Hacker?</i> Did you try any programs from the April ish? And what about December '88 - the unfinished <i>Squelch</i> program? Write to Dave McCandless for information or to complain and waste a stamp. Never a reply and never a reprint to correct the errors. No, I tell a lie, you did once print a few corrected lines in the <i>Psst!</i> section. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) The free games. The mag usually says 'Fab', 'totally brill' or 'megagame'. Some are good, but do you ever read the reviews that you gave the game when it first appeared? Your descriptions in the magazine rarely match the reviews in past issues. This is usually the same with the demos and reviews of the finished product. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4) What about the 'All-new reviews'? They are total rubbish. The symbols used are very poor and you should 'review' them again before the next issue. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5) I would say the best section in <i>YS</i> is <i>Adventures</i>. I am not even a fan of adventure software but Mike Gerrard certainly writes a decent and readable section without the smut and sarcasm that you seem to enjoy in your editorials and replies to readers' letters. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I think it's time you resigned and left <i>Your Sinclair</i> because quite frankly, if it continues as it is doing under your leadership it won't be around much longer! <br> <b> Keith Taylor <br> Wybers Wood, Grimsby <br> </b> <br><i> Our sales figures don't hold with your final comment I'm afraid. Still, it'll be interesting to see what other readers feel about your views. Mind you, on the </i>Program Pitstop<i> point, all I can say is yes, things have been a bit dodgy recently due to - well it's a long story. But rest assured that from now on it's going to be perfect every month. Honest. <b>Ed</b>. </i> <p> <TABLE align=center BORDER BGCOLOR=cyan BACKGROUND=""><TR><TD> <table align=left><tr><td align=center><IMG src="../thumbs/letters/trainspotter.jpg"><br><font size=5><B>TRAINSPOTTER<br>AWARD</b></font></td></tr></table><font size=4><b> A MATTER OF DEGREES</b></font><br> Well, you stupid cloth-heads have done it again, haven't yer? Slap your eyes on page 43 of the May ish. Yeah, that's right, the compo page. When you've managed that little job read the far right column and you should get to the part that says "...study the diagram below". So I studied the diagram below and what did I find? A bloomin' entry coupon, that's what. The diagram is to the left, you clots, so I claim my Trainspotter Award here and now! <br> <b> Lee Burton <br> Hathwaite, Harts <br> </b> <br><i> Oooooooh, silly us. I'd better send you one then, hadn't I? <b>Ed</b>. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't make it that easy you clot. Say that he was reading the mag the wrong way up or something. <b>T'zer</b>. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Um, it seems you were reading that particular page the wrong way up. You should have turned it 90&deg; anticlockwise, then things would have made more sense. Sorry, no Trainspotter. <b>Ed</b>. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's more like it. <b>T'zer</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> DID YOU SPILL MY PINT?</b></font><br> <p><center><a href="../thumbs/letters/big/43a.jpg"><IMG SRC="../thumbs/letters/43a.jpg"></a></center><p> It looks like your staff are being unfaithful to you! Enclosed is a billing from the <i>Radio Times</i> for <i>Lenin Of The Rovers</i>. As I looked at the small print I noticed that the writer was none other than Marcus Berkmann. So, Dr B has moved from the humble <i>Tip Shop</i> to the heights of Radio Four! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, the show was quite good (so tell Dr B) but if he slags off us Northerners and our teams again, a bunch of Boro fans will personally come to Castle Rathbone and feed Berkmann to Phil Snout. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So - if you don't want to lose a good member of staff, warn him not to offend us. <br> <b> Nick Sweeney <br> Middlesborough, <br> Cleveland <br> </b> <br><i> I'll give you a Trainspotter even though I personally think that all Northerners are a bunch of whining ninnies! <b>Ed</b>. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eeer, I think that's a bit rash actually. <b>T'zer</b>. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, I won't give you a Trainspotter. <b>Ed</b>. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's not what I meant. <b>T'zer</b>. </i> <p> <font size=4><b> FANTASTIC COCK-UP</b></font><br> I claim my Trainspotter Award for seeing in the review of <i><a href="dnawarrior.htm">DNA Warrior</a></i> that Marcus said it was a rip-off of a sixties movie called <i>Fantastic Journey</i>. Well ha! <i>Fantastic Journey</i> was some crap Disney film starring two dogs and a cat. What Marcus really meant to say was <i>Fantastic Voyage</i> which starred Raquel Welch! <br> <b> Archibald Bloggs <br> Sheppey, Kent <br> </b> <br><i> No Trainspotter because </i>Fantastic Journey<i> was not a crap film. I for one was deeply moved by the heroic exploits of the two canine chums, as they bravely protected their feline friend from bears, polecats and skunks on their epic trek across the United States. <b>Ed</b>.

I stopped at the voting form for Game Of The Year '88. I filled it in, cut it out and mailed it, then flicked over the page to find that some clot (no names) had put the review of <i><a href="dragonninja.htm">Dragon Ninja</a></i> on the other side. Piecing it together was impossible because I couldn't fit my hand in the letterbox. Next time put an advertisement on the other side - or I will send the Mafia round to make you play <i><a href="thedeep.htm">The Deep</a></i> for five hours solid (evil stuff eh?). <br> <b> Derek Robertson <br> Whitburn, West Lothian <br> </b> <br><i> Oh, sorry.

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Dear Madam Pico 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next door neighbours went on holiday recently and left me in charge of their dog, Brandy. The next day I nipped out to the shops and tethered Brandy to a pole on the pavement while I popped in to buy a tin of Pedigree Chum. When I came out, not only was there no sign of the dog, but also no sign of the pole. It transpired (the police phoned me later) that I had tied him to a ladder on the back of a big American camper-van which had dragged him away. It wasn't until 30 miles down the road that the driver noticed something amiss and pulled over. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Needless to say, the dog was dead. The problem is that I had decided to tell the owners on their return that Brandy had died of natural causes - that is until his body was returned to me. Quite frankly it's a mess - bits hanging off all over the shop. Foul play is sure to be suspected. I can't tell them the truth so what on earth can I do? <br><b> Kevin Avery Abingdon, Oxford <br></b><i> Oh Kevin dear, you are in a fix aren't you. Luckily there are many 'ways out' of this one. I'll give you two. Firstly, you could take Brandy's broken body to a taxidermist, where for a small fee you can have it patched up and stuffed. Hand this 'package' back to its owners and you can go for the death-by-natural-causes story. Alternatively, you can simply bury the poor thing in the garden and tell your neighhours that the ungrateful hound ran off somewhere, the day before their return. I don't know how much money they left you for dogfood, but using the second method you actually stand to make a small profit on the whole deal. </i> <p><center><a href="../thumbs/letters/big/43d.jpg"><IMG SRC="../thumbs/letters/43d.jpg"></a></center><p> </font></td></tr></table> <p> <TABLE BORDER=0 ALIGN=center VALIGN=center><tr><td align=right> <TABLE BORDER=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 bgcolor="black" background=""><TR bgcolor="black" background=""><TD><font size=2 color=white><i><b>Doodlebugs</b></i></font></td></tr> <tr><td bgcolor="black" background=""><a href="http://wos.meulie.net/pub/sinclair/./magazines/YourSinclair/Issue43/Doodlebugs/YS43Doodlebugs01.jpg"><IMG SRC="../thumbs/YS43Doodlebugs01.jpg" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=268 ALT="Doodlebugs"></a> </td></tr></table> </td><td><TABLE BORDER=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 bgcolor="black" background=""><TR bgcolor="black" background=""><TD><font size=2 color=white><i><b>Next Month</b></i></font></td></tr> <tr><td bgcolor="black" background=""><a href="http://wos.meulie.net/pub/sinclair/./magazines/YourSinclair/Issue43/YS43NextMonth.jpg"><IMG SRC="../thumbs/YS43NextMonth.jpg" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=415 ALT="Next Month"></a> </td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <p>
