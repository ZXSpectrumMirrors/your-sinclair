<div>Ironically, I am polishing off this 
review on 8th May - which, as 
the historians among <i>Your 
Sinclair</i>'s readers will know, is the 
43rd anniversary of VE Day, the 
day the Germans finally 
surrendered to the Allied forces, 
so bringing the war in Europe to 
a close. If the 8th May was the 
grand finale in the European 
theatre of war, then 6th June 
1944 - just over 11 months 
before - was the beginning of 
the final act. It was on that day - 
the 44th anniversary of which 
will have passed by the time you 
read this - that the British and 
American forces finally landed in
Normandy, to open the Second 
Front. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, CCS - known for the 
excellence of its strategy games 
- gives you the chance to 
command the invasion forces as 
you re-fight Operation Overlord. 
As you pit your wits against 
Rommel - soon to be forced to 
take poison by the Gestapo after 
being implicated in the July 24th 
plot to assassinate Hitler - you 
have a momentous choice. 
Do you follow the plans made 
by Eisenhower and the Allied 
Chiefs of Staff? Do you land on 
the beaches the invasion forces 
really landed on - Sword, Juno, 
Gold, Omaha and Utah, still 
marked to this day by the 
wreckage of 44 years ago  or 
do you think you can do better? 
Perhaps a landing in force 
around Cherbourg would mean 
that you could get your troops 
ashore with ease, and it would 
give you a major port: but then, 
the German forces could easily 
seal off the neck of the 
penninsula, denying you access 
to the open land beyond, and 
forcing your armour to fight in 
unfavourable terrain. Or should 
you land further to the east, 
much closer to Paris - but also 
in an area with much heavier 
defences, and closer to German 
reinforcements? Do you use 
your airborne units to protect the 
flanks of your invasion - which 
would be historically accurate - 
or should you reserve them, to 
be used either as ordinary 
ground troops, or dropped later 
when they might tip the balance 
at a vital moment?. Life's not easy 
commanding the invasion of 
Europe! 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's a lot easier, however, 
playing CCS's version, than it 
would be commanding the real 
thing. <i>Ovedord</i> is a one player
war game - which I personally 
prefer, as I have never 
understood the point of two 
player computer war games. You 
the player control the disposition 
and movement of the Allied 
invasion forces. The computer 
plays the Germans.

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first choice you have to 
make is to decide what difficulty 
level you want to set the game 
at. There are three, with one 
being the easiest and three the 
hardest. I chose level one for my 
first game, but still managed to 
completely mess things up. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You decide which of your 
divisions are landing on which 
beach. There are 12 beaches to 
choose from, the historical five 
plus another seven which the 
allies might have chosen. You 
can land on five of the 12 
beaches and as you do so, 
markers appear on the map 
window, indicating where the 
landing areas are. It's not a good 
idea to spread your landing 
areas out too much, as your 
forces won't be able to support 
each other efficiently. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once you've picked the 
beaches, you have to decide 
which division will land on each 
one - although you could decide 
to land units from the same 
division on different beaches. 
But again, this is not really a 
good idea unless the beaches 
are very close to each other, 
because if you scatter the parts 
of your divisions too far apart, 
they will not be able to fight at 
their best. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can land one unit on a 
particular beach at a time; and, 
in the first turn, you may only 
land rifle units. The heavier 
troops, artillery and armour, 
have to wait until later. Once 
you've picked who goes where, 
you then get a chance to land 
your airborne forces. You have 
to land them within three 
squares of a landing beach 
which is being used by the 
division they are a part of, so you 
can't parachute into gay Paris on 
the first turn. You should 
probably use them to attack the 
enemy forces closest to the 
landing beaches, to stop them 
from counter-attacking your 
troops on the sand. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once you've started landing 
your units, it is important to get 
them off the beaches as fast as 
you can. You can only bring in 
new units if the beach-head is 
clear, so you must start off by 
creating a protective perimeter 
around your landing areas. Once 
you have the bulk of your forces 
ashore, you can then start 
expanding the beach-head and 
trying to break-through the 
defending Germans. At first, it 
will be a war of attrition; but once 
you have ground down the 
enemy, gaps should start 
appearing in his lines and you 
should be able to punch through. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ordering your units is 
simplicity itself. Simply give them 
an objective to make for, and tell 
them where you want the 
divisions left and right flanks to 
be. I would have preferred an 
extra option, giving you the 
ability to order individual units, 
but I accept that the way the 
game works now is a very good 
simulation of real warfare, within 
the restrictions of the memory of 
a 48K Spectrum. You also have 
to tell your forces what to do if 
they run into the enemy. You can 
either attack, defend, or use 
your initiative. If you attack, then 
you will do more damage to the 
enemy, but also suffer more 
casualties. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that is basically it. The 
mechanics of the game are 
sufficiently simple for the player 
to be able to devote his time to 
the real challenge, the strategic 
decision making. And 
challenging it is - working out 
the right way to winkle the 
Germans out of their defensive 
positions without exposing your 
own troops, is a fine art. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I only have two criticisms. First 
of all, nowhere in the rule book 
does it tell you what the symbols 
on the unit counters actually 
stand for. I can work it out, but 
then I have been a wargamer 
and military history buff for a 
long time now. But it would 
probably have been useful for a 
beginner if the unit symbols had 
been identified. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, I found it very difficult to 
tell my left from my right - or 
rather, my units' lefts from their 
rights. This is not because of any 
personal problem with 
orientation, but because it is 
never made clear whether left 
and right refer to the player's left 
and right, or the units'. As the 
player is facing in the opposite 
direction to the units he controls, 
it can be confusing. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quibbles apart, <i>Overlord</i> is an 
excellent game. It offers hours of 
challenging entertainment, and 
could even teach some history at 
the same time (though I wouldn't 
be too put off by that!). Another 
winner from CCS.
