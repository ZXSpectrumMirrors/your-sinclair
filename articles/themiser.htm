<div>Now what the Dickens 
is this? An
adventure based, on 
<I>A Christmas Carol</I>, that's 
what, released with 
impeccable timing (ahem) 
by the ever-reliable Jack 
Lockerby. But is it a 
Christmas cracker? Well, it 
ain't bad, even though I 
don't quite relish playing 
the part of Scrooge, being, 
as it is, the exact opposite of 
my generous self. Who said 
"Bah, humbug"?! 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said it, that's who, and I 
said it in response to the 
miserly packaging that 
comes with this game. I 
mean, you don't expect 
glossy colour posters, but 
you should get a little more 
than a playing guide that's 
only 13 lines long. It gives 
only one useful command, 
TALK TO SHOPKEEPER, 
and doesn't even have 
loading instructions. 
Suppose you're a newcomer 
to computers and 
adventures? It's bad enough 
when games say "Accepts 
the usual adventure 
commands", but I'm always 
getting mail-bags of letters 
from players asking how 
they're supposed to know 
what these commands are 
when they've never played 
an adventure before. So 
come on, Indies, pull your 
fingers out - photocopied 
playing instructions 
and commands only cost a 
few pence. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frustratingly, <I>The Miser</I> 
is probably best suited to 
novice adventurers, as 
many of the problems in it 
are relatively 
straightforward. It's not 
that the experts won't like it 
as well, as it's very 
enjoyable to play. The 
author's to be congratulated 
for producing an 
entertaining game from a 
book that it wouldn't have 
occurred to me to use for 
inspiration. Reading the 
book won't help you much, 
it's the characters and 
Christmas spirit that <I>The 
Miser</I> calls upon. You play 
Scrooge and have to 
complete 12 good deeds 
before the end of the game, 
and then go to your 
nephew's house and claim 
your reward. You're even 
told what the 12 deeds are, 
such as feeding some 
hungry orphans, finding 
coal for an old lady, 
getting a dog for Tiny
Tim, a turkey for Bob 
Cratchit's wife, and 
so on.
 
I thought the
Cratchits were 
meant to be 'umble
and poor, good folks 
and all that, but 
they've all the 
bustlety of a money-grabbing bunch of 
yuppies when you 
visit them! Tiny Tim 
wants this dog, Martha 
wants a book, Peter wants a 
job, Belinda wants a fiddle... 
good grief, a clip round the 
ear's what they want, 
though that wouldn't make 
for much of an adventure I 
suppose. You discover all 
this if you SLEEP at the 
start of the game, when 
skeletal hands grab you and 
take you out into the 
Christmas streets and force 
you to visit the greedy 
Cratehits. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back in real life, there's a 
whole townful of places to 
explore, including taverns 
and tobacconists, butchers 
and churches. There's also a 
neat time-travel idea that 
allows you to go off 
'exploring' with the Ghosts 
of Christmas Past and 
Christmas Future. At one 
end of the street there's an 
exit that takes you 
FORWARD in time, while at 
the other end you can go 
BACK to your childhood and 
see yourself growing up. The 
FUTURE option shows you 
the outside of Bob Cratchit's 
house, with a wreath nailed 
to the front door. Oh dear. 
Better get back to the 
present and sort out the 
probs. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feeding the orphans isn't 
too hard, provided you can 
get past the headmaster (ex-Dotheboys Hall) who blocks 
the front door. Maybe his 
beery nose and bloodshot 
eyes are a clue. There's also 
a dog behind him. Just the 
thing for Tiny Tim, I 
thought, but as soon as I got 
in the dog got out, the 
wretched hound. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further along I found a 
bump in the road or as 
Inspector Clouseau might 
say, a bermp. It doesn't do 
anything, just seems to sit 
there looking... well, bumpy. 
I found a few bugs as well as 
bumps, one being that when 
you unlock your front door 
you're given a message 
about junk, which in fact 
should only come up when 
you're in the junk yard. It 
also seemed a bit odd that 
when I examined the roses 
round a cottage door I was 
told that I'd pulled out a 
spade! What? Must have 
been a pretty big rose bush! 
Never mind, a spade comes 
in very handy for digging, 
and I remembered a place 
where that might be 
possible. I found me a bone. 
Easy, I thought, now let me 
get to that locked gate with 
the growling, slavering 
beast of a dog behind it and 
give it the bone and I'll get 
past it and... botheration, 
the dog won't take it. Drat 
and triple drat, the author 
saw me coming. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That makes two dogs in 
the game, which is 
appropriate as it's been 
written using <I>PAWS</I> (boom-boom). Jack Lockerby knows 
his way round this utility, 
apart from the few hiccups 
which are probably all now 
corrected. The screen 
layout's clean, with a 
location description at the 
top and scrolling messages 
and responses underneath. 
No graphics, no surprises, 
but a good solid adventure 
from our mutual friend, 
Jack Lockerby. If you're 
facing hard times in a bleak 
house then buy <I>The Miser</I>, 
and as long as you don't 
have great expectations you 
won't be disappointed.
