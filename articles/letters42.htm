<p> <font size=4><b> IT'S A MIRACLE</b></font><br> Oh mighty, mighty powerful one. A couple of months ago my trusty 48K conked out so I had it mended, then recently the same thing happened again so I took it back, saying "a couple of months ago you mended this and now it's gone wrong again." To this the reply I received was "Costya 27 quid!" 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ain't paying 27 quid I thought, so I walked out in a huff and bought <i>YS</i>. As I caught the bus I put your hyper-skill mag in the bag along with my computer. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then when I got home I plugged in my computer and it worked - it must have been the miraculous power of your absolutely brilliant, superskill megamag. So thanks a lot!! You're the best mag in the world, and you yourself personally are absolutely excellent (plus you're better looking then certain teddy bears I could mention.) <br> <b> Andrew McAuliffe <br> Blackthorn, Northampton <br> </b> <br><i> Well, it's just more proof (as if any were needed) that </i>Your Sinclair<i> refreshes the parts other computer mags cannot reach. <b>Ed</b>. </i> <p> <font size=4><b> TWICE AS NICE</b></font><br> It's about the competitions. There's nothing wrong with the actual things themselves, but where you print them is a pain. I mean, why do you put them on the reverse side of a page with something brilliantly superb on the other. For example issue 40: on page 68 there's a compo to win a +3 and on the reverse side is the one and only <i>Bargain Basement</i>, so if you snip out the coupon you ruin your copy of <i>YS</i>. The only solution I have found is to buy two copies of the mag: one for keeping for the future and the other for cutting out compos (you can also doodle on T'zer's face). But doesn't this mean paying twice for a single copy of <i>Your Sinclair</i>? <br> <b> Russell Hart <br> Bolton, Lancs <br> </b> <br><i> Buying two (or indeed three) copies of the mag is the method I'd personally suggest, but if you're really tight in the old Shekel department you can always photocopy the competition coupons. And if I ever catch you doodling on my face you'll be for the high jump. <b>Ed</b>. </i> <p> <font size=4><b> FREAK OUT</b></font><br> I have got a 48K rubber key Speccy and just recently it has started freaking out on me. When I turn it on loads of daft patterns come on screen and I can't get it onto the copyright screen. If and when I do finally get it going without it freaking out, and try to load a game, it just says M RAMTOP, NO GOOD 10:1 What does this mean? Because if you don't find out why these things keep happening I'm going to seriously damage someone's health by shoving my Speccy up someone's nose - SIDEWAYS. Please, please, please, please and four million more pleases can you tell me what's up. Oh, your mag's rad by the way! <br> <b> Peter Leyland <br> Bacup, Lancs <br> </b> <br><i> There's a technical term for what's wrong with your Speccy. I'll just look it up in my '</i><i>Your Spectrum</i> And What's Wrong With It<i>' troubleshooter manual. Here we are, page 32 paragraph nine.

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been reading the mag now since it became <i>Your Sinclair</i>, and still have a few old copies of <i>Your Spectrum</i> lying in a cupboard. I have to say that there has been a great change in production and professionalism over the years. I love the new <i>Pssst!</i> section and the <i>Tip Shop</i>, but to my mind <i>Program Pitstop</i> is the best of your new features. The best part of the magazine however is the free tapes. These games, demos and extras are incredible. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much as I would like to get games such as <i><a href="heroesofthelance.htm">Heroes Of The Lance</a></i>, I just do not have the money! It's very frustrating having a computer but only the chance of playing the same ancient games over and over again. Not so anymore! <i>Dustin</i> is brilliant - my favourite, closely followed by <i><a href="armymoves.htm">Army Moves</a></i> and <i>People From Sirius</i>. In fact these cover games were what finally made my mum dig deep into her pockets and shell out the money for the subscription I have enjoyed over the last year - which meant I got the bonus of a free full price Ocean/Imagine game. I must come clean and admit that the free game I got with my subscription last October (<i><a href="targetrenegade.htm">Target Renegade</a></i>), is my newest game (if you don't include the cover tapes). I will end by simply giving advice to any casual browser or regular reader of these pages: get a subscription! It's the best Spectrum investment you'll ever make! <br> <b> Iain McGuire <br> Cambuslang, Glasgow <br> </b> PS Due to me lending copies out to friends, I have got one of them to subscribe and another to, if not defect from another inferior magazine, at least to buy <i>YS</i> as well. Not bad eh? <br> <br><i> You poor old thing. I expect you live on a diet of gruel and water and only receive an orange for your Christmas present. My heart-strings have been tugged to the point where I bestow upon you the Star Letter prize: i.e. Three spanky new games to add to your moth-bitten collection. A warning to others hoping to clean up by sending a sob-story, though - it won't work. I'm now hardened to all tear~jerkers. Send them instead to Simon 'Simes' Bates. <b>Ed</b>. </i> <p> </td></tr></table><p> <font size=4><b> HANDY TIPS</b></font><br> I would like to help a lot of people with two problems for the +3. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) SAVEing 48K Basic programs to the +3 disk: 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Add this line to the program: 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 SPECTRUM 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then SAVE 'name' LINE 1 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it runs you'll get an ERROR message. Then all you have to do is type: 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 and then ENTER (to remove line 1) 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then 'R' and ENTER to RUN the program 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Printer port on the +3: The way to get the printer to work with the +3 is to:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yo! <br> <b> C. Andrews <br> Pontypridd, Mid <br> Glamorgan <br> </b> <br><i> Yo! indeed. <b>Ed</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> DODGY LUG'OLE</b></font><br> I've got a sob story to tell you people. Once upon a time.... What?! Enough of this tosh I hear you cry. Anyway, I had saved ten quid to buy <i><a href="xenon.htm">Xenon</a></i> 'cos you'd done a review on it in your April ish and megagamed it - and with the left-overs I was going to get <i><a href="antiriad.htm">The Sacred Armour Of Antiriad</a></i> (which had got a good review in <i>Bargain Basement</i>). But disaster struck - my mum went into hospital for an operation on her ear-drum (no jokes please) and I had to buy her a present, therefore losing my tenner. So, er, could this be the Star Letter or Star Sob Story. By the way, T'zer, you remind me of Janine of <i><a href="realghostbusters.htm">The Real Ghostbusters</a></i>: sexy, cool and irresistable. Slimer reminds me of Sean Kelly - a fat ugly blob. I must depart - mother is calling me for assistance. Farewell and thank you for even letting my letter be a part of this raggamuffin style mag <i>(Eh? Ed.)</i> <br> <b> Iain Kempson <br> Old Colwyn, Clwyd <br> </b> <br><i> Okay, you win the Star Sob Story, but unfortunately this new category only earns you a badge.

The 'death' bit doesn't have an 'A'. I should know because I'm well into Megadeth. <br> <b> David Yates <br> Oldroan, Merseyside <br> </b> <br><i> To decide whether or not you get an award I'm going to put a Megadeth album on at full volume for nine minutes. If any neighbours complain you don't get a Trainspotter, if no-one complains you do. Actually I'm not even going to bother putting the album on, as it's a foregone conclusion really, innit. No Trainspotter. Sorry. <b>Ed</b>. </i> <p> <font size=4><b> T'ZER TEASER</b></font><br> Right then, T'zer me gal, yer little scheme's been rumbled. In T'zers in the March ish, in the bit where you're blithering on about <i><a href="renegadeiii.htm">Renegade III</a></i>, there's a bracketed bit from the Ed telling you to shut up. Now then, now then, the more observant among you (been eating your carrots?) will notice something strange, or stvvvvange if you ask Frank Muir. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's right: T'zer is Ed. You can't tell yourself to shut up (well you can I suppose, but anyway), so either; 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1)	T'zer hates herself 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Someone else writes T'zers 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) T'zer is not the Ed after all 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4) She's been getting grief off 'er 'oosband 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Er, ignore that last one <i>(consider it ignored. Ed)</i> Now either send me a Trainspotter Award, &pound;3,000,000 or a SAM Coupe. Your choice. Aren't I an amiable chap? <br> <b> Leigh Loveday <br> Port Talbot <br> </b> PS Did you know that Phil's name is an anagram of Hush Pilot? No? Well be grateful then. <br> <br><i> Did you know that an anagram of your name is 'Give Ed a Holly'. And guess what my least favourite species of the plant kingdom is. That's right - holly I hate the stuff. Which means I'm not going to give you a Trainspotter either. <b>Ed</b>. </i> <p> <font size=4><b> LLANFAIR ETC.</b></font><br> I hereby require one of your Trainspotter Awards. While doing the incredibly peasy Christmas Wordsearch (ish 37), I noticed that your spelling had gone completely wrong. In particular the word 'LLANFAIRPWLLGWYNGYLLGOGERYCHWYRNDROBWLLLLANTYSILIOGOGOCH'. <i>[No, I'm not even going to check the spelling on that one. You all know the word he means... - NickH]</i> In wordsearch you spelt it 'LLANFAIRPWLLGWYNGLLSOGERYCHWYRNDROBWLLLANTYSILIOGOGOTH'. This is wrong. In the list you spelt it. 'LLANFAIRPWLLGWYNGYLLGOGERYCHWYRNDROB WYLLANTISILIOGOGOCH'. This is wrong as well, and is different from the wordsearch spelling, which is spelt .... (only joking). 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you don't know how to spell it, here it is spelt properly: 'LLANFAIRPWLLGWYNGYLLGOGERYCHWYRNDROBWLLLLANTYSILIOGOGOCH'. The meaning, if you didn't know (and even if you didn't you should have) is, 'St Mary's Church in the hollow of the White Hazel near a Rapid Whirlpool and the Church of St. Tysilio near the Red Cave'. So now you know. <br> <b> Michael Smalley <br> Grimsby, South <br> Humberside <br> </b> <br><i> The good news is you've got a Trainspotter. The bad news is you've got to collect it from Gertrude, our 38 stone typesetter.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>David</b> - Yes he has Richard. The monster at the end of level 58 is so massive that you'll need four television sets to fit it in!!! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Rlchard</b> - And so colourful, detailed and superbly animated that you'll need sunglasses to play it!!! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>David</b> - But our adoring public needn't worry, had they Richard? The four tellies and the sunglasses are totally free with the game!!!

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm having trouble at boarding school. I've been here for three years and I haven't made any friends. In fact nobody has actually talked to me yet: even the teachers ignore me. This ongoing 'Coventry' situation was unbearable enough, but recently things have been getting much worse: I'm talking about bullying. Everybody has started kicking me. I'll just innocently walk down the main corridor and a fellow pupil will hurtle towards me at great speed and deliver an earth-shattering blow to one of my shins with his boot. It even happens in the library and the chapel - there doesn't seem to be anywhere I can get away from it. 1 got the cane for falling over in assembly last week, but I couldn't help it: my lower leg areas are literally black and blue - I regularly collapse as a result and am in constant pain. P.E. is a total nightmare, especially when we play football because I get booted about more than the ball. The idea of goal-scoring seems to be only a secondary consideration in the minds of the opposing team: and my team as well, come to think of it. There isn't any point in telling staff members about my problem, as I just get more of the same treatment from them. I just don't know what to do. Please help me.

If there's really no one for you to turn to, I suggest you go in for personal leg protection to at least alleviate the pain until everybody gets bored with kicking the pips out of your shins' (which I'm sure will happen eventually). I've thought quite hard about this and have come up with the solution - lots of egg boxes. Sew them inside the lower part of your school trousers (and your track-suit bottoms for football practice). They will soak up the impact of any vicious swipes made by your school. Chums: not that they're 'chums' really, are they Nigel. You'll probably have to change the egg boxes every couple of days though.

It's the end of an era, we know, but next month you'll get the chance to write in to the new Ed, <i>Matt Goss Bielby</i>. (Swoon!) So get scribbling.
