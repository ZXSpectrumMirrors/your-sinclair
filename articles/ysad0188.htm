Have you ever had one of those adventure problems that's really had you stumped? You tear your hair out, crawl up the wall, and you <I>still</I> can't find the answer, then when you ask a friend, they say 'But it's so easy!' So you try again, determined to work it out for yourself, finally you give up and ask someone for the answer. And it really <I>was</I> easy and so obvious you'd kick yourself if you weren't sure that you'd miss. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Les Mitchell</b> of Hull has just had one of those problems. "In <I>Buckaroo Banzai</I> I've managed to climb into the cockpit of the jet car, but try as I might and I've tried every night, I can't get out again. How do I escape from this cockpit as no input seems to work for me (or is this a bug in the program?)" Well, no bug, Les, unless it's in your own operating system. The input you need? A fiendishly complicated: GET OUT! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Daniel Stothard</b> of Sheffield thinks his friend <b>Michael Brown</b> is having him on. After Michael told him that he was the world's first person to finish <I><a href="dracula.htm">Dracula</a></I>, Daniel saw his name in these very pages asking for help on it. Well Daniel, I don't know if Michael was the world's first to finish that game, and I'm not sure how you tell that anyway, but don't forget there's usually a delay of at least a month, and sometimes two, between someone writing me their letter and you reading the magazine at home, so don't believe everything you read and certainly not in my column! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Wayne Styles</b> runs an adventure swops club which I've mentioned before, and he's written in to ask me to let people know that he's just moved to Bolton, Lancs. Send a sae for details of the club. Another change of address to note: if you liked the sound of <I><a href="penelesstootncomein.htm">Toot 'n' Come In</a></I> from Epsilon Software that I reviewed in my last round-up, it's now being sold by the quaintly named Bitchin Software, Stourbridge, W. Midlands. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyone playing <I><a href="rigelsrevenge.htm">Rigel's Revenge</a></I> and want to swop notes? If so, contact <b>Robin Cavill</b>, Dewsbury, W. Yorks. Robin offers some hints, such as remember goggles at the start and watch out for trapped doors. To get rid of the man on the porch? THGIL TA ELBBUR WORHT. In return he needs some help with the following: how do you make the stun-gun work? How do you get into the bumzalow? What do you do in the desert besides getting lost and eaten? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What <b>Gary Dobbs</b> has been doing in <I>Rigel</I> is inputting the authors' names. Try it and you get comprehensive clues depending upon your position, and this also works in <I>The Sols Tale</I>, says <b>Gary</b> of Gilfach Goch (and try saying that with a mouthful of Vimto). 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My thanks to <b>Lynda X</b> of West Lothian, and that's not 'cos she can't sign her own name. She's just being friendly. Lynda sent me a solution to <I><a href="shardofinovar.htm">Shard Of Inovar</a></I> from the Mastertronic Bulldog range. You must be a fast worker, Lynda, as my review copy only came the following day! Some tips for other adventurers are to examine the hole but beware the hand, EERT OT DRAHS EVIG, don't forget you can blow the knife, and swimming is just a fish of a certain rosy hue. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now someome whose name I can't read at all, as he put it on the bottom of a postcard that's been rained on and all the ink's run! He asks where the bone is in <I><a href="inspectorflukeit.htm">Inspector Flukeit</a></I>, and how to get it. Now just 'cos we've found a dog, it don't mean there's got to be a bone, do it? (Do you like my masterful command of English grammar?) Try getting rid of the dog by some other nasty means. In <I><a href="dodgygeezers.htm">Dodgy Geezers</a></I>, how to stop the dynamite blowing up when you've recruited Cracker? Try to not recruit him in the first place, as he's obviously not very good at the job. And how to stop dying in the caves in <I>Matt Lucas</I>? Try going SEENENEESSESEESSW. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Michael Dooherty</b> of Glasgow asks how to get past the mansion in <I>Zzzz</I>. How about examining it and climbing up something instead? <b>Robert Shaw</b> from Rosshire asks about <I><a href="custerdsquest.htm">Custerd's Quest</a></I>. Namely how to stop being killed when you enter the Evil One's room, and what to do with the photo of the princess? You'll find a use for the photo once you stop being killed, and to do that, try BMOB WORHT before you enter. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some <I>Spiderman</I> clues from <b>Matthew Conway</b> for reader <b>Darren Roy</b>, who was recently flummoxed by the game. In an attempt to deflummox him, Matthew says that the mirror is fixed, if you can't see through the illusion try feeling it, try hitting Electro with Doc Oc's arm and don't go near the egg. <b>Conway the Barbarian</b> also complains that <I>Lost Souls</I> is fast becoming a Lost Arcade-Adventurers column and as an adventure-only fan, he is not amused. Well, Matthew, I keep trying to tell people to attend <I>Dr Berkmann's Clinic</I>. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Bob Ray</b> of Beds is stuck in part two of <I>Arkham Manor</I> but says he's determined not to ask for help just yet. He'll offer some tips on the first part though. To get the cross you'll have to wait 'til the third day when you'll find something of a different shape to give to the vicar to allow you to take the cross. To enter the crypt, just say 'crypt' to the vicar, and he also likes words like 'sulphur' and 'gunpowder'. The teacher is good at translation. The colonel's wife might like something you find on day two. In part two you're going to need the hammer, needle, key and chalk. And finally a warning for when you move south through where the barrier was at the end of part one, you only get one chance to save the game. Have your tape recorder set up correctly otherwise you start again, or alternatively SAVE just before that, in case your final one doesn't work. And finally from me, a 'Hello' to <I>Arkham</I> (and <I>Redhawk</I> and <I>Kwah!</I>) programmer <b>Mike Lewis</b>, who came and introduced himself at the PCW Show. Nice meeting you, Mike. And when can we all rush out and buy the next brilliant game? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of buying games, <b>G S Raybould</b> of Surbiton asks where other readers buy their adventures from, as they're often hard to find in the shops. This is something that could prove very useful to lots of people, so let me hear where your favourite supplier is. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's printer trouble up in Preston, for <b>Chris Gornall</b> with his copy of <I>Vera Cruz</I>. Chris says his copy has a malfunctioning printer option and he fixed it by delving into the program. You should enter the following before the last GOSUB in line 900: IF I = 1 THEN LPRINT S$. You then delete line 940, et voila, mes petits choux. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last word this month goes to <b>Graham Collier</b> of the aptly named Odd Down in Avon. Graham says "Just lately I've been having lots of laughs from my adventuring, but none have tickled me more than <b>John Wilson's</b> <I>Lizard-King</I>. Quite often I think about it, and always end up chuckling to myself." So do I, Graham, but let's get back to adventures. "I really think you ought to give this, and his other games another good plugging because not only are they amusing, but they offer a very worthy challenge to any player." 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No sooner said than done. End of plug.
