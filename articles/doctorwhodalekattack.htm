<div><b>The scene: Alternative 
Software. Enter an excited 
minion. 'Hey! I've just 
bought the licence to that 
top TV prog 
and-longest-running-SF-programme-of-all-time 
<i>Doctor Who</i>!' 'Wow! Great!' (A pause.)
'So what's it about, then?' 
'Erm...' 'Weren't there Daleks in 
it?' 'Oh yes. Daleks. And, er...' 
'Well, just get someone to write a 
game where the Doctor runs 
around a lot and shoots 
things. Oh, and put in lots 
of Daleks.' </b>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's all rather depressing, 
really. The one thing <i>Dalek 
Attack</i> has is no relation at all to 
the TV prog. The Doc tears 
around the place armed with a 
machine gun trying to pass 
itself off as the sonic 
screwdriver, chucking 
grenades and generally 
behaving like The Doctor 
They Pushed Too Far. You 
get the choice of playing 
Ace (who's well known for 
shooting things and 
blowing them up) so turning the Doctor into 
Rambo Who is a bit pointless. But, hey, 
enough tedious trainspotting. You're probably 
wondering how the game plays - except for 
Fiona of Stratford, who's trying to remember if 
her library books are overdue. Fiona, they 
would have been, but I've renewed them over 
the phone. And do stop bending down the 
corners of the pages - use a bookmark. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The designers of the game have cleverly 
played up the hitherto underdeveloped 
Hollywood action film aspects of the 
TV programme. A spearhead 
Dalek invasion has taken over 
four cities, London, Paris, Tokyo 
and New York, protecting 
them with force domes. Pods of 
devious design are dissipating 
the ozone layer in preparation 
for the main force to land, so 
the Doctor infiltrates the domes 
by (dashed cunning, this bit) 
going through sewers and 
underground railway 
stations to get under them. 
A bit of gratis violins, a 
barney with an end-of-level guardian and it's off 
to the next bit. Ultimately you nip off to 
Skaro to capture Davros, the Daleks' 
creator, so there you go. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technically, <i>Dalek Attack</i> can't 
be faulted. It plays at a cracking 
pace, scrolling two-thirds of the 
Speccy screen smoothly and at a 
knockout speed. Incredible. The 
Doctor and Ace leap about like 
someone's forgotten to switch on the gravity, 
and there's some lovely 
interaction with the 
backgrounds, with the Doc 
hanging from ledges and signs 
and sort of moving along hand-over-hand. Fab. There's even a 
Whovian touch to remind you 
you're playing a game about 
Doctor Who - the Doc holds 
onto his hat when he jumps. 
All in all, and ignoring the 
embarrassingly crap intro 
sequence, a really impressive 
start. (Better play the game 
properly then.) 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b><i>Seek, locate, 
spiflicate</i></b><br>
The Daleks haven't come to 
Earth alone, oh no. They've 
got a few minor baddies from 
the programme along with 
them - Ogrons, Robomen, 
er, roboty sphere-ish sort of 
things 
and 
(oh 
blimey) 
some sort of big 
flappy-trousered 
boss type. To 
give the game a bit 
of shape, they've 
kidnapped a couple of people, 
and you have to find a set 
number each level before 
heading for the exit and 
confronting the guardian. 
There's the usual tricky 
map layout, with a bit 
of running 'in' and 
'out' through various 
doorways. This is a bit 
of a bodge - to 
enter a doorway 
you have to stand 
centrally and hit 
up, so it's too 
easy to 
inadvertently 
jump into the 
path of a monster's fire. That's another thing 
the bad guys fire constantly if they see you. 
There's no break in the pattern, giving you no 
chance to avoid or jump past them without 
losing energy. You don't even have enough 
time to shoot then dodge the retaliatory blast, 
and I soon found myself running around at top 
speed and damning the consequences. 
Even if you do manage to zap a 
monster, it regenerates after a couple of 
minutes, which to my mind is a pretty 
low way of making the game harder - as 
is not resetting their positions when you 
leave a room, so there's a chance one 
will get you as soon as you materialise 
in a doorway. And another thing again -
if you fall off a high ledge and die, you 
don't reappear on the ledge, but lower 
down, in mid-air. If you can't twist 
quickly enough to catch another 
ledge, you lose all your lives in a 
fashion horribly reminiscent 
of <i><a href="ystop100_3.htm">Jet Set Willy</a></i>. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Apparently Admiral are 
going to engage in a little 
programmish tweaking to fix 
the baddies-in-the-door way bug, 
so we'll give them the benefit of 
the doubt there, but as far as I 
know. The other two bits are 
there to stay. Oh, and dear.) 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b><i>Answer that and 
stay fashionable</i></b><br>
But it's not all bad news. The pace makes for 
an exhilarating platform game, and there 
are enough hidden bits and power-ups 
to keep explorer types happy. Even the 
multiload isn't that obstrusive. The 
game just seems haphazardly - and at 
times, shabbily - put together. 
Thore's no internal logic - as 
well as the Doctor shooting 
people, you've got Daleks 
spiriting hostages away to 
ledges and up chimneys, and bits 
of the scenery that may or may not 
be climbable (they certainly look 
climbable, but you don't know if 
they're just bits of the scenery 
until you trying jumping for
'em). The two-player mode is
awful (you can flip between
Ace and the Doctor, but may as 
well stick to one all the way 
through as there's no discernible 
difference between their 
abilities). Worst of all, those 
design faults that load the 
game in favour of the villains 
rob it of a sense of 
achievement (it's more 
'Blimey, lucky I managed to 
get that monster who 
popped out of nowhere before his continuous 
laser stream finished me off' than 'Ha! 
Another skilful dispatch for Rambo Who. 
Hurrah for the forces of good!'). 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I dunno. <i>Doctor Who</i>'s been knocking the 
socks of every Speccy fan who's seen it ('How 
did they get it moving so quickly?' 'Wow!' etc) 
but then again, they've not been playing it. I 
have, and I'm disappointed. As a tie-in it falls 
to bits (as most do) and as a game it irritates 
the hell out of me. It's above average, but then 
only marginally. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>MANUAL LABOUR</b><br>
The manual for <i>Dalek Attack</i> is 
offensively poor. From trainspottery 
factual errors ('Davros glanced around 
the room menacingly' - er, he's blind, 
guys) to a rejection of the 
programme's whole ethical stance 
('Quick thinking, agile reflexes and a 
tactical use of weapons are needed' - 
so what happened to outwitting the 
villains?) it invites ridicule. The worst 
- and actually relevant in a 
non-tediously-trainspottery-sort-of way - 
bit is the list of features and 
instructions. The booklet bangs on about 
the types of villain, the weapons 
available, the extra features, the 
'hidden collectables' and the shop 
sequences, then prints a little 
disclaimer saying 'Certain features are 
not available in the Commodore, 
Spectrum and Amstrad versions due to 
restrictions imposed by these 
computers'. Or, 'We're not telling 
you what's relevant to your 
machine, but it's your fault for 
having a crap 8-bit anyway.' Of 
course, you realise this means war. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>COVER VERSION</b><br>
After the cover of this ish 
went to the printer, we 
realised that there was no 
YS-y joke on the cover 
headline. It was 
supposed to read 'Daleks 
conquer and destroy! 
(Bless 'em)' but 
due to, er, this 
and that we 
never got around to putting 
in the last bit. So, if 
you feel that this 
month's headline is 
just a mite too seriously 
violent for YS, please 
take the trouble to write 
'(Bless 'em)' on a piece of 
paper and affix it in 
the appropriate spot. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That concludes our Changing The 
Cover masterclass. Next month! A 
course on how to improve the 
<i><a href="dizzy.htm">Dizzy</a></i> issue by removing 
all references 
to Dizzy! 
<i>(That's 
enough. Andy)</i>
