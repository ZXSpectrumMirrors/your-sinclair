&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the sequel should feature my own personal favourite, the Mountfield Turbocut 3.2L with sunroof and fluffy dice, as well as, possibly, a 'trying to start the damn thing' sub-game (perhaps a joystick waggler?

So, basically, git yerself a subscription, cobber, that way you'd be sure of getting the free tapes, and of getting your issues a lot cheaper and sooner.

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That many? Handy tip if you start to get keyboard troubles (ie some keys don't or only partially work!). First UNPLUG YOUR SPEC, then undo the screws on the case. Remove the top part of the case slowly - very slowly in the case of the 48K+ because it has a reset switch. Now, you will see two wide plastic strips going into two upright interfaces (plastic things which stick upright for the non-technically minded). 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pull out the plastic strips from their interfaces and look at them. If the gold lines on the strips are faded and worn where the plastic curls over into the interface, or the plug is a bit worn, then this is the cause of your problem. (If the gold lines are not worn out then reassemble the Speccy and send it off to the repair shop!) 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To set things right, simply pull off the thick plastic plugs at the bottom, then cut the worn ends off with a pair of scissors, leaving nice solid strips to stick the plastic plugs back on to (making sure you stick them back on the way they came off!). Now simply plug the strips back in, reassemble, and then try out your handiwork. If it doesn't work, then you've probably got the plastic bits which strengthen the strips on the wrong way round. Unplug the power again, take the Spec apart, and make sure that the gold strips are touching the pins and that the plugs are not obscuring them. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, and on the Speccy+ there are two plastic strip holders at the back. Undo these before is even starting! <br> <b> Michael Carter <br> St Ives, Cambs <br> </b> <br><i> Well, that sounds straightforward. The cable ribbons of which you speak are more likely to wear at the 'plug' end, but if wear appears in the middle (where the ribbon is folded to fit inside the Spec) then cutting is not recommended 'cos the ribbons (plastic strips) will be too short for you to reassemble your machine! If you do feel brave enough to look inside your machine, always make sure the power is OFF!

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very confused! You see, my parents, who I trust implicitly, have always maintained that babies come from the cabbage patch. However, of late I have been told a most disturbing and very different version of events by my Biology teacher! I know it is very wrong to doubt the word of one's peers, but someone must be telling porkies! Is it my Mum and Dad or is it Mr Tidmarsh? <br><b>Confused<br> Reigate</b><br><i> My, my, 'Confused', don't get yourself into such as state. I myself was also deeply shocked when I discovered that babies come from cabbage patches. It must be so cold for them, the poor dears. Consider the implications of someone who was not a keen gardener and left their cabbage patch untended. The infant could be out there for ages before being discovered. And it wouldn't be a sweet child at all but a scruffy little urchin completely devoid of social graces. Perhaps that is why there are so many rather cruel people around, like the ruffian I encountered on the Number 2 bus last Tuesday evening. Anyway, I think your Mr Tidmarsh should be writing to me, and not you!</i><p> Dear Madame Pico, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please help me! I have just finished my GCSE exams and everyone keeps telling me that I should have some idea of the career I would like to aim for. I know what I'd like to do, but nobody will take me seriously. Basically, the only job that I want is to be Captain Fishface. You know, that cheery, bearded chap sailing about the Caribbean, eating only the finest cod steaks, and singing hearty sea shanties at the drop of a hat. Can you advise me because my Careers Teacher is obviously inept? <br><b>Tom Staines <br> Dunstable </b><br><i> Well, Tom, luvvey, what romantic aspirations you hate stirring in that young breast of yours. I think, however, that you should perhaps be a little more realistic. I mean, you couldn't expect to be Captain Fishface straight away, now could you? I expect you would have to work your way up. Do you have a good singing voice? Maybe you could join a local Gilbert and Sullivan society and convince them to stage a production of </i>HMS Pinafore<i>. Also getting used to sea travel could be quite handy. I mean, all the finest cod steaks in the world won't do you any good if you haven't got your 'sea legs'. Perhaps some practice on the local boating lake could stand you in good stead. </i> </font></td></tr></table> <p> <TABLE BORDER=0 ALIGN=center VALIGN=center><tr><td align=right> <TABLE BORDER=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 bgcolor="black" background=""><TR bgcolor="black" background=""><TD><font size=2 color=white><i><b>Doodlebugs</b></i></font></td></tr> <tr><td bgcolor="black" background=""><a href="http://wos.meulie.net/pub/sinclair/./magazines/YourSinclair/Issue48/Doodlebugs/YS48Doodlebugs01.jpg"><IMG SRC="../thumbs/YS48Doodlebugs01.jpg" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=113 ALT="Doodlebugs"></a> </td></tr></table> </td><td><TABLE BORDER=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 bgcolor="black" background=""><TR bgcolor="black" background=""><TD><font size=2 color=white><i><b>Next Month</b></i></font></td></tr> <tr><td bgcolor="black" background=""><a href="http://wos.meulie.net/pub/sinclair/./magazines/YourSinclair/Issue48/YS48NextMonth.jpg"><IMG SRC="../thumbs/YS48NextMonth.jpg" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=424 ALT="Next Month"></a> </td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <p>
