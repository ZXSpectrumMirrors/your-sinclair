<b> Well, stone the crows, chalk my cue and raise my rent. He's finally popped his clogs, he's ceased to be, he is no more, he is in fact an Ex Editor <i>(A Managing Editor actually! Man Ed)</i>. Yep, the Ex Ed has penned his last and now I shall be putting my ha'pennyworth in. Anybody found sending in ludicrous, wacky or just downright stupid letters is very likely to end up with a <i>YS</i> badge. So now you know! (Agony letters won't be answered in confidence.) </b> <p> <font size=4><b> GOING FOR A SONG</b></font><br> Hi there! Whilst sitting on the great think tank last night - trousers round ankles and reading <i>YS</i> - a little ditty came to mind (cue witty comments). As yet there are no lyrics but here's the basic tune to be going on with: 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do dumdum dooo, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;diddly diddly diddly do 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;boom diddly dum do, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dumdum dum (big build up) 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doooodoooo 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hope you all enjoy it, I was humming it all night! <br> <b> Pete Shields <br> Middleton, Manchester <br> </b> <br><i> You don't fool me, I've heard that one before. It was the 1973 Swiss entry to the Eurovision Song Contest called </i>Boom Diddly Dum Do<i>, sung by Field Marshal Walter von Kloset und die Ballcocks. Incidentally it scored nul pwoints, easily beating the Norwegian entry, and reached number 1,065 in the Paraguayan charts. <b>Trivial T'zer</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> IN THE NAVEL</b></font><br> I am not in the habit of communicating with journals, such as that you purport to 'edit' but I have been stirred from my inertia by a disgusting piece of sensationalism in your September issue entitled '<i>YS</i> Bubble Gum Cards'. This described (totally erroneously I might add), the structure and function of 'belly-button fluff'. As president and founder member of the Royal Society for Research into Fibrous Navel Detritus (or FND as we call it), I feel most strongly that I must take you to task. Latest research has shown that FND is in fact the nesting material of the largely unknown submicroscopic lesser navel dormouse <i>(Rattus umbilicus)</i>. Incidentally, I believe I am entitled to one of those 'trainspotter' thingummies for being, I believe, the only person alive able to recognise the rummy hole shown as belonging to none other than the luscious, lascivious Teresa Maughan. <br> <b> Terry the Terror <br> Bradford, West Yorks <br> </b> <br><i> Hah! Well spotted, TT, the picture is in fact one of T'zer's rock cakes, doing a startlingly lifelike impression of Gwyn's disgraceful belly. As a founder member of Button Fiddlers Anonymous, I feel I must point out two flaws in your treatise on FND. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) The existence of the </i>Rattus umbilicus<i> has been proven to be an old wives tail, sorry, tale, by Prof Heinrich Von Naughtypicken in his best selling book </i>Nicht Fingerpoken Und Fluffen Proben<i>! A fine work! The weaving tips are particularly useful. 2) How on earth do you know what T'zer's Button looks like, hmm? <b>Phil</b>. Just a short excerpt from Phil South 's new blockbusting novel, </i>How To Look A Complete Pillock In Only Ten Days<i>. And no, you don't get a trainspotter award. <b>T'zer</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> RAUNCHY RACHAEL</b></font><br> In reference to Gwyn's 'relationship' with that most gorgeous, sexy, shapely, raunchy and luscious of reviewers, namely Rachael Smith, I have only two things to say. 1. Gwyn, you lucky bar steward! and 2. Gwyn, you lucky bar steward! <br> <b> Phantom Sweater <br> Middleton, Manchester <br> </b> <br><i> What's that you say? Gwyn a lucky bar steward? So he's been moonlighting has he? And not only that - he's been doing two other jobs as well. What I want to know is how come a reviewer on </i>YS<i> has the experience to serve alcoholic beverages to the public? On second thoughts he's probably had very good training. And where does the luscious Rachael fit in? I s'pose she's a bunny girl in her spare time! <b>T'zer </b> </i> <p> <TABLE align=center BORDER BGCOLOR=white BACKGROUND=""><TR><TD> <FONT SIZE=6><B><U>STAR LETTER</U></b></font><br><font size=4><b> MAY THE FORCE...</b></font><br> Your mag is a hero. <i>(Heroine purlease! T'zer)</i>. After I'd finished my homework I decided to power up my faithful Speccy for a bit of relaxation and load up <i><a href="lightforce.htm">Lightforce</a></i>. But, shock, horror, gasp, would you Adam 'n' Eve it, I couldn't get the flippin' thing to load. I sweated away for nearly an hour trying to get the darn thing to load and was just about to give up in despair, when I picked up the July issue of <i>YS</i>. And stone me, but the cover just fell off in me hands (honest guv!) I then ripped off a little piece from the corner and wedged it into my recorder to hold the tape still. Hey presto! <i><a href="lightforce.htm">Lightforce</a></i> loaded with no probs at all. I know your mag has strange effects on people but on Speccies as well? I found the game a bit too easy as I reached 180,000 with five lives left. Still, I'll never forget that t'riffic July issue with its great powers of persuasion. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amazing! <br> <b> Steve Flynn <br> Andover, Hants <br> </b> <br><i> You don't need to tell me about the supernatural effects of </i>Your Sinclair<i>. I fixed my washing machine with the October issue, stopped a burst pipe with the November issue and cooked a three course meal with all the trimmings with the December issue. Not only that, </i>Your Sinclair<i> can cure severe depression, the common cold and constipation. S'amazing! And my name's Alexander Fleming! <b>T'zer</b> </i> <p> </td></tr></table><p> <font size=4><b> ISN'T SHE LOVELY</b></font><br> "Wow! Amazing. Cor worra woman!", I thought as I read the January issue of <i>YS</i>. No, I wasn't looking at T'zer, I was looking at the picture of Harriet Watson in the <i>Vox Pop</i> feature. After I'd pulled myself together I knew what I had to do... Yes, write in to you with an SOS - please can you get me Harriet's address. I know she may be a year or two older than me but I don't care. I'm not a poseur (though I do dress well) and I'm certainly not big headed. So, please Harriet contact me. We could be penpals or something...! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yours pleadingly, <br> <b> Paul Johnson <br> Elstead, Surrey <br> </b> <br><i> Penpals eh? I wasn't born yesterday. I know why you want Harriet's address. Well, you're not getting away that easily. I'm going to expose you </i>(Pardon? Phil)<i> for what you really are. You'd do anything just to get your hands on something dark, sweet and gooey in the middle. Yes, you're a Rolo fetishist, you disgusting perv. If you want Harriet's address you'll just have to put an advert in Penpals like any other inhuman being. Now where did I put that giant Mars Bar? <b>T'zer</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> PURLES OF WISDOM</b></font><br> I would just like to point out that I do not possess an anorak, neither do I use Ian McCaskill's specs. I'm sure you're not too interested in Cramptons, Egg-Timers, Rats, Whistlers, Slim Jims, Duffs, Christmas Trees, Peaks, Brushes, Choppers, Syphons and quite a few more. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think you are confusing the basic differences between gricers, bashers and trainspotters. Please send me the award and I'll say no more. <br> <b> PW Purle <br> Ruislip, Middlesex <br> </b> <br><i> I should hope you don't use sunny Ian McCaskill's specs. How would he be able to read the weather map and drizzle on about the forecast and make the usual cock-ups if you did? It's snow joke being as blind as a bat, I can tell you. On the subject of Cramptons, Egg-Timers and such like - you're right. I'm not at all interested in a lumberjack's tools, especially his chopper. As for gricers, bashers and trainspotters - there are no basic differences - they're all names for Ian McCaskill. <b>T'zer</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> IT'S GOT BELLS ON</b></font><br> Hey, I'm that 'Noddy' guy from <i>Small Print</i> in the January issue. I thought I'd tell you what would improve <i>YS</i> slightly. As well as having T'zers why don't you have an Ed's column? And where's our promised crossword? And what about <i>The Quest For The Holy Grail</i> maps and tips? I also think the <i>YS</i> T-shirts have too many doodles all over them when they could have just the <i>YS</i> logo as a designer label. This I wouldn't be embarrassed to wear. <br> <b> Andrew 'Nods' <br> Carmichael <br> Clacks, Scotland <br> </b> PS Before the Ed does one here's a Noddy joke: 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Q</b>. Why do elephants have big ears? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>A</b>. 'Cos Noddy can't pay the ransom. <br> <br><i> That's a great idea about having an Ed's column and a T'zers column but we do it already 'cos I am the Ed, if you see what I mean. Write to Mike Gerrard and he'll send you tips for </i>The Holy Grail<i> - don't forget to include an sae. I think you've got a problem if you feel embarrassed wearing the superbly designed </i>YS<i> T-shirt with oodles of doodles. Are you sure you're not covering up </i>(His chest? Phil)<i> for some other affliction that you're embarrassed about. You can tell me love. Will you do that for me, will you? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PS You're not getting away with such a noddy joke that easily. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Q</b>. What's red and blue and goes in, out, in, out? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>A</b>. Noddy stuck in a revolving door. Boom Boom. <b>T'zer</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> HUNT THE DICK</b></font><br> Why is it (sob, sob) that a certain person who just so happens to live at 36 Fleetwood Close, who answers to the name of Richard, has never won a compo in his life. I've spent &pound;100's on stamps and envelopes and not one single teensy, weensy little thing has popped through the door saying you've won a compo and here are all your lurvely, lurvely games. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Jan '87 issue nobody actually got the <i><a href="jackthenipper.htm">Jack The Nipper</a></i> Compo right and I didn't bother to send an entry in 'cos I knew there would be no point (plus I was skint at the time) but I got all the answers right. So now you know why I'm so distraught and sobbing. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any little object would do - like a <i>YS</i> badge for printing this heart-shattering letter. <br> <b> Richard Hunt <br> Sheerness, Kent <br> </b> <br><i> Have you ever thought about looking to see whether there's a hole in your door (called the letterbox)? Perhaps this could be the reason. Alternatively it could just be that you're a complete and utter idiot. I mean fancy not entering a compo just 'cos you think there's no point. Maybe that will teach you a lesson. Still, because I'm feeling rather generous at the moment I'll send you a </i>YS<i> badge. <b>T'zer</b> </i> <TABLE align=center BORDER BGCOLOR=cyan BACKGROUND=""><TR><TD> <table align=left><tr><td align=center><IMG src="../thumbs/letters/trainspotter.jpg"><br><font size=5><B>TRAINSPOTTER<br>AWARD</b></font></td></tr></table>Hey! What's this? "The Trainspotter's Christmas Box." Why, this is for me! Nice of this Mischa guy to think of me. Now let's see ... Aha! <i>(Not Moron, Chum and Maggot again? T'zer)</i>. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gently remove centre pages" 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay (rip). Oops! Now where's the tape? Ah, there it is. You sticky thing you... 'ere let go of my finger! There. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hold thus" 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wonder what that means. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fold along dashed line" 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Fold, fold, fold) So, where've all the instructions gone (Skim, skim). 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How stupid to put them inside. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cut along top of book" 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call that a book! Now for the scissors. (Snip, snip) Ouch! I knew I should've got an adult to help me. Quick, I need a plaster before my copy of <i>YS</i> gets covered in blood. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Staple or tape spine" 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More sticky tape... rustle rustle... Oh no, I've done it inside out. More rustling. Hey presto! But what's this, the centre page is upside down. (Even more rustling ... ) Now the cover's upside down and hmm ... scratch... scratch, sniff ... sniff. How very peculiar. (More scratching and sniffing). Nothing happens! Have I been attacked by some rare and strange virus that has left me without my nasal faculties? Or is it that I just can't smell? Anyway, send me a trainspotter award and we'll hear no more about it. <br> <b> Dennis Lindqvist <br> Kagerod, Sweden <br> </b> PS Nice to see you back again Kevin. <br> <br><i> I've always said his back is better than his front. <b>T'zer</b> <p><center><a href="../thumbs/letters/big/15a.jpg"><IMG SRC="../thumbs/letters/15a.jpg"></a></center><p> </i> <p> </td></tr></table><p> <font size=4><b> WHAT A WALLACE</b></font><br> Way back in the good ol' days <i>(You mean when Barry Manilow was nothing more than a twinkle in his father's eye? T'zer)</i>, when time was dawning and the Spectrum was still young and innocent (well, around 1984 anyway), a young, brave, macho crusader left his humble dwelling on his way to purchase the king of all machines. The most majestic of computers, the one and only (drum roll please) rubber keyboard Speccy. Since that fateful day he has never looked back and has built up a superior armoury of tapes, peripherals and magazines. But alas, the happiness in the kingdom did not last, for that fiendish knight, Sir Clive, overode this young, brave (you get the idea) crusader's power by producing a larger, more awesome machine. The biggest beast in the kingdom - the Sinclair 128K. Despair, gloom and despondency shrouded the land. Until one day the young, brave... <i>(Get on with it. T'zer)</i> crusader built up the courage to go on a long and dangerous mission to Ye Olde WH Smith. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After many days and nights he reached said place of terror and approached cautiously. He spotted the beast of the land (the 128) and decided then and there he must have it. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lights flashed, the earth moved and he was never the same again, in fact he then lived happily ever after... <br> <b> Jory 'disappointed' <br> Wallace <br> Bramley, Kent <br> </b> <br><i> So you bought a 128. And?... And?... And?... <b>T'zer</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> DRUNK AND DISORDERED</b></font><br> I hereby claim my trainspotter award for drunkeness, (I blame the Christmas booze-up in the Art Dept.) What am I going on about you may ask and indeed you may. I'm referring to the <i>Carry On Screening</i> feature in the Jan issue. First of all <i><a href="astrocade.htm">Aliens</a></i> is certificate 18. Secondly, the film reviews for <i><a href="topgun.htm">Top Gun</a></i> and <i><a href="shortcircuit.htm">Short Circuit</a></i> are the wrong way round. Since when has macho (he makes me sick) Tom Cruise been a robot called Number 5? Finally, and last, the certificate for <i><a href="bigtroubleinlittlechina.htm">Big Trouble In Little China</a></i> is wrong. It's actually certificate PG. Apart from these minor quibbles, the magazine is brilliant - keep up the good work. <br> <b> Mark Parker <br> Uxbridge, Middlesex <br> </b> <br><i> Shurely you don't mean ush? Hic! Ish definitely the Art Department's fault. You woushn't find me, hic, doing that short of thing. Sho, you don't get the trainshpotter award. <b>T'zer</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> THAT IS THE ?</b></font><br> Being fairly new to <i>Your Sinclair</i>, there are a few things that I would like explained. The first thing concerns the question marks in <i>Your Sinclair</i>. Why do they look like a small 's' over a dot (?) <i>[Except on this website, of course... - NickH]</i>. Why aren't they proper question marks???? I would also like to know what a Hex Loader is and other such stuff. Why don't you have a beginners corner? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also outraged at the person who wrote in saying that the price of <i>YS</i> should be rounded up to a pound. Doesn't he realise that for every 19 <i>YS</i>'s he could use all the extra five p's to buy another one. I've taken advantage of the free game offer and taken out a subscription to the mag so it's even better value. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To finish on a nice note (E sharp I think!) the mag is great, much better than your rivals. <br> <b> RA Wilkins <br> Liongunnar, Dyfed <br> </b> <br><i> That wasn't an E sharp, I can tell an F flat when I hear one. What's wrong with my question marks???????????? I rather like them actually, at least they're better than the Ex Ed's brackets. </i>(I resemble that remark. Ex Ed))))))))))))<i> It's pretty lucky you've taken out a subscription to </i>Your Sinclair<i> 'cos the price has had to go up to a pound due to the shortage of cornflakes. Which means you save even more money when you take out a subscription. We always think of you. <b>T'zer</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> HACKED OFF</b></font><br> While hacking into an unknown computer system, look what I found. I must add that this discovery made me most depressed and unhappy.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NATURE OF FILE: Deletion order, code three

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BACKGROUND: Letter published in the November issue of <i>Your Sinclair</i>.

This letter is clearly sexist and immoral (which is why it was published).

T'zer)</i>. What is a trainspotter for goodness sake? Can't find it in the dictionary and my teacher doesn't know what it is either. And I'm too ashamed to ask my friends - they'd laugh their heads off! I think it might be someone who warns cars that there's a train coming, but in Finland the railway junctions are automated so who needs a trainspotter? <br> <b> Timo Koponen <br> Pieksaimaiki, Finland <br> </b> <br><i> According to </i>Chambers 20th Century Dictionary, New Edition<i>, a trainspotter is one who collects locomotive numbers as a hobby. This definition does omit a rather important species of trainspotter - the </i>YS<i> one. He or she is someone who looks like Ian McCaskill, has all the style and panache of Les Patterson and spots really minuscule mistakes in high-brow, well-produced publications like </i>Your Sinclair<i>. Trainspotters of the highest order get the widely acclaimed trainspotter award and will now receive a beautifully hand-produced </i>YS<i> Trainspotter Certificate.
