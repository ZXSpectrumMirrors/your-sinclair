<div><I>Dyadic</I>. Hmm. Phoenix assure us that the 
name means 'two units treated as one' but 
those medical connotations just won't go 
away. Anyway, what we have here are two 
games, <I>Snake Mania</I> and <I>Craft</I>, effecting a 
happy coexistence on a single disk. And do 
you know what? <I>(What? Jonathan)</I> I'm not 
going to review them separately. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b><I>But why on Earth not? </I></b><br>
Well, it's not because they were both written 
by a Mr Maciej Kasatkin of the ESI coding 
group, who shows off his demo writing talents 
as usual with bouncing scrollies and flying 
logos with built-in inertia all over the shop. It's 
not because they both have a variety of rather 
good tunes (written by Anorzej Mielcarek), but 
are lacking in good juicy sound effects for 
when you get killed or something. Neither is it 
because they both have high score tables with 
a rather slow left/right control for entering your 
name rather than just quickly and easily typing 
it in (although <I>Snake</I> does have, as an added 
bonus, a rather novel scrolly saying words to 
the effect of "well done, you got x points, and 
you rank nth". That sort of thing). 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, the reason why I won't be reviewing 
them separately is because they're both 
puzzle games and as such, deserve to be 
treated with at least a heaped tablespoonful of 
contempt. For heaven's sake, don't you think 
we've got enough darned puzzle games? Do 
we really need another two to add to the 
thousands already available, as opposed to 
the two or three mediocre shoot-'em-ups, 
arcade adventures and beat-'em-ups? Now 
there's an idea - how about a <I>Target:
Renegade</I> thumper or something? There is not 
a single SAM beat-'em-up game available. Is 
is really that impossible to program something 
other than a puzzle game? I'm sorry, but I've 
really had it up to here with puzzle games! 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b><I>There there, calm 
down. Drink this cup 
of Ovaltine</I></b><br> 
(Slurp). Ah, that's better. Right, I'm fully 
relaxed, and my mind is perfectly 
composed. The fact is, here we have two 
puzzle games, and no amount of 
screaming and kicking and pulling one's 
hair out is going to alter that. What I shall 
now attempt to do is to briefly run through 
the context of each game, weigh up the 
pros and cons, and then give them a 
ridiculously low mark solely because 
they're both puzzle games! (Snarl, 
dribble). Sorry. Right, <I>Snake Mania</I> first. 
This game sees you in control of a snake 
which you have to manoeuvre around a 
maze eating the obligatory dots. As you 
eat them, the length of your snake 
increases proportionally, 
and you have to plan 
your route a considerable 
time ahead so as to 
avoid running into your 
own tail, which 
presumably kind of 
gridlocks you so that you 
eventually die of 
starvation or something 
(you lose a life, in any 
case). The idea, very 
simply, is to eat all the 
dots before the counter 
runs down to zero. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Craft</I> is another 
incredibly simple concept 
which is fun to play, but 
it's hardly new ground. 
Here you have to shuffle 
and rotate tiles to form closed pipes before, 
again, the timer runs out. Pretty novel - not. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b><I>One from the heart </I></b><br>
I know what you're expecting. You're 
thinking, he's not really going to give 
<I>Dyadic</I> a bad mark just because it's only 
a couple of puzzle games. I mean, 
they're probably quite playable and quite 
original compared to other puzzle 
games, right? Wrong. In a flooded 
market like this, <I>Dyadic</I> would have to be 
pretty spectacular to worth buying over 
any other game, and I'm afraid that it 
isn't. Just another couple of average 
puzzle games. So, for the sake of my 
sanity and the continued wellbeing of 
Coupe owners everywhere. Here's a plea 
from the heart to all SAM 
programmers. For heaven's 
sake, write something else!
