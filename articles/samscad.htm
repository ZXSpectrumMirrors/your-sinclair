<div>Well, here it is at last, SAM's answer to 
<I>AMOS</I>, going by the distinctly unhealthy 
sounding acronym of <I>SCADS</I>. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 'System' comprises one disk and a very 
smart-looking two hundred and eight page A5 
ring-bound manual. On the disk are a few 
demo programs, which, I have to say, do look 
quite impressive - and then there's the 
development system itself, split into two 
distinct parts, the Designer and the 
Supervisor. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>The Designer </b><br>
Basically, the Designer lets you make up your 
game sprites, rooms, animation sequences, 
sound effects, and so on (although you can 
import graphics from <I>Flash!</I> if you wish). The 
Designer is actually very good at what it does - 
the sound FX generator, for instance, 
manages to overcome the lack of sound chip 
support in SAM BASIC rather admirably, and 
the features are well thought out. It's all WIMP 
controlled and very nicely presented, and I 
actually enjoyed using it, to a point - that point 
being when you develop beyond the 'new 
user' stage, and the performance of a 
relatively simple task like undoing a mistake 
involves negotiating hundreds of menus (well, 
at least three) when a keypress should suffice. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In general, the menu system suffers from a 
badly thought-out design - for example, the 
confirmation 'Are You Sure? Y/N' tend to be 
situated on the far side of the screen from the 
current menu, which, when you're trying to get 
some serious work done, is not helpful. A bit of 
a rethink is needed for version two, I think. 
Let's not end on a bad note, though - the 
designer is actually a very good, very powerful 
program, just let down slightly by the menu 
system. Moving on... 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>The Supervisor </b><br>
Once you've designed all your graphics, 
sound, rooms, etc, it's time to move on to the 
real bones of the program, the supervisor. This 
is essentially SAM BASIC with the extra 
commands thrown in, although admittedly the 
new commands are extremely powerful and 
there are plenty of them, but you do still have 
to know how to use BASIC, as you'll need a 
fair sprinkling of DO...LOOPs and your 
IF...THENs to make the thing work. This is, 
unfortunately, where all the nice front end 
WIMP business stops. Let's face it, if you 
were restricted to fixed menu options all the 
way through, you wouldn't get versatility, and 
versatility really has to be <I>SCADS</I> middle 
name if it's going to enjoy anything like the 
success of <I>AMOS</I>. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's no escaping the fact that you have 
to learn a language, however high-level, 
before you can program games. On the other 
hand, <I>SCADS</I> extended BASIC is very 
powerful, and provided you've got an 
elementary grasp of SAM BASIC, you 
shouldn't have much trouble using it. I did feel 
that the manual skipped over this, the most 
important section, a bit though - a few more 
tutorials would have gone down a treat, 
instead of having to depend solely upon the 
glossary at the end. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>Final Verdict Time</b><br>
Having pointed out most of my personal 
quarrels with the program, I really ought to 
finish off by saying that <I>SCADS</I> is a very 
powerful games designer. One which anyone 
with enough unquenchable enthusiasm could 
use to create their own games, with only a 
fraction of the hassle that the other, more 
conventional languages provide. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that this is the first version, though, 
does show. Badly thought-out menus, lack of 
Supervisor documentation, and several 
unforgivable glitches in the manual (all you 
need is a proof reader!) all go to show that it 
needed a bit more polish. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, there are no plans (as far as I
know) for a second version, although there is 
a <I>SCADS Compiler</I> in the offing. This will 
convert your games into machine code, 
allowing anyone to play them, because at 
present you have to own a copy of <I>SCADS</I> to 
play <I>SCADS</I>-created games, so that's good 
news. My advice to you is, buy if you think 
you've got a long enough concentration span 
to cope with the rough edges. My advice to 
Glenco is get the compiler out ASAP, take a 
long hard look at <I>SCADS</I> and release an 
improved version with a discount for 
existing users. Judgement has been
passed. Thank you and goodnight.
