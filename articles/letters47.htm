<p> <font size=4><b> IT'S A RIGHT EYE OPENER!</b></font><br> Let me tell you about an enlightening experience I have just had! I hadn't bought <i>YS</i> for a few months 'cos I was planning to buy an Amiga, and had lost interest in Speccy games. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, I thought I'd buy this month's <i>YS</i> to see if anything had changed and to get the free tape. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I got back from the newsagents, I loaded up the demo of <i><a href="passingshot.htm">Passing Shot</a></i>. Wow! Worra game! By now I was seriously thinking of keeping my +2. Then I decided to look at <i><a href="advancedlownmowersimulation.htm">Advanced Lawnmower Simulator</a></i>. Whoooa! You just don't get games like this on the Amiga! Can the 16 bit games really be much better than <i><a href="passingshot.htm">Passing Shot</a></i>? No, I decided, and the Speccy games are a fraction of the cost! So now I have decided to keep my Spectrum - thanks to <i>Your Sinclair</i>. <br> <b> Stephen Lovell <br> Cannock <br> </b> <br><i> Yep, the Spectrum, it's a blimmin' miracle, isn't it!? And full marks to Garden Soft for showing us the full capabilities of this remarkable machine! <b>Ed</b>. </i> <p> <font size=4><b> MOW COMMENT!</b></font><br> I, Sir Tobias of Ilford, claim to be the first person to finish that spanky game, <i><a href="advancedlownmowersimulation.htm">Advanced Lawnmower Simulator</a></i>. Using no POKEs or cheats, I managed to mow the lawn so well that I was offered 'a corned beef sandwich'! Here are my tips for the garm. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 ) Choose the Patio Sprintette. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Keep the 'M' key pressed. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) That's it! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I congratulate you on managing to get Garden Soft to allow you to put such an addictive and brilliant game on your super, lurvely, smashing, boing, boing, oo-er, how's-about-a-bit-of-how's-your- fatherly, superb, free tapes! <br> <b> Mr Massive <i>(Oo-er. Ed)</i> <br> Ilford <br> </b> <br><i> Oh, thanks for the Ipswich Town fixtures listing enclosed with your letter... er, it'll... erm, come in most handy. <b>Ed</b>. </i> <p> <font size=4><b> YOU KNOW IT MAKES SENSE!</b></font><br> I have a problem. The trouble is my copies of <i>YS</i> don't last as long as other top selling brands of washing up liquid I could mention. No sooner have I got them home than it's all over. Couldn't you give me some hints and tips on how to make them last longer? <br> <b> Zug The Indescructible <br> Fareham <br> </b> <br><i> If you're talking about </i>YS<i> lasting longer as a mag, then you could do no better than to invest in a sturdy </i>YS<i> Binder (or two). If, on the other hand, you're trying to use </i>YS<i> to help you with all those domestic chores, then we'll have to consult some expert advice... <b>Ed</b>. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've been testing </i>YS<i> out against some other leading brands on this cub scout jamboree, and have found that </i>YS<i> lasts three times longer than its closest rival! It even removed all traces of Bernard Matthews' Crispy Crumb Turkey Chops! <b>Nannette Newman</b>. </i> <p> <font size=4><b> ROCK STAR TOOK MY DELTIC DIESEL LOCOMOTIVE NUMBER!</b></font><br> David Wilson, take a step out of the limelight and make way for a new(ish) mega-group - The Trainspotters! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, folks, it's true! While on a shopping excursion, I spotted a bundle of records for the princely sum of ten 'bob' so I whipped out my cash and bought them. Imagine my surprise looking through them when I found <i>Hiring The Hall</i> by The Trainspotters! Just to prove I'm not fibbing, I've enclosed the record (at great expense) for your aural pleasure. <br> <b> Mark Parry <br> Middlesborough <br> </b> PS Sorry about the packaging, I can't afford Jiffy bags! <p><center><a href="../thumbs/letters/big/47a.jpg"><IMG SRC="../thumbs/letters/47a.jpg"></a></center><p> <br> <br><i> We're sorry about the packaging too. The record broke in the post. But never mind, 'cos by sticking it together with a Pritt stick, spinning it on a pencil, and 'playing' it on the spike on the back of one of T'zers earrings, we were actually able to hear </i>Hiring The Hall<i>. It's a lovely ditty about hiring a church hall in order to hold a train number swapping night and is the follow up to their former big 'miss', </i>You Need Platform Tickets<i>. <b>Ed</b>. </i> <p> <font size=4><b> A BRUSH WITH FATE</b></font><br> Dear oh dear, Matt, what a state your mouth is. No wonder with all those letters shoved in your kisser. But I have the answer. This special toothbrush is made so you can brush your teeth and keep T'zer's fan mail (or even yours) in your gob at the same time <p><center><a href="../thumbs/letters/big/47b.jpg"><IMG SRC="../thumbs/letters/47b.jpg"></a></center><p> <br> <b> Billy Ramsay <br> Scotland <br> </b> <br><i> Thanksh flor nushing, Villy. Now I chant shay anything wishout shpitting bitsh of tofpashte all over the offish. (Ptui!) Phew, that's better. Now at least I don't have to get a flip-top head. <b>Ed</b>. </i> <p> <font size=4><b> GET REAL!</b></font><br> I am convinced that your 'Wonderful World Of Speccy' is a joke and an insult to your overseas readers. In your 43rd number there was a letter from Krzysztof Frys of Poland. I had a Polish friend of mine translate it for me. He didn't know what language it was written in! It certainly wasn't Polish! Don't make up letters when people send in real letters to you. <br> <b> Sally Ginsberg (Granth) <br> Sweden <br> </b> <br><i> We were very miffed to hear this, because every letter that appears in </i>YS<i> is genuine. Sometimes, if they're a bit too long, we chop them down a bit, but they are all 'real' As for Krzysztof's letter, we're baffled! Ever since </i>YS<i> was mentioned by a Polish magazine called !Bajter! we've been inundated with loads of strange requests from that marvellous country. Krzystof's letter was one of these, as was amply proven by its franked Polish stamp. As for insulting our overseas readers, this couldn't be further from our minds. It's just that some letters are a tad amusing to an English speaker. But who are we to criticise - they still speak English far better than we can speak Polish, Swedish, Italian, Lap, Mongolese...! <b>Ed</b>. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speak for yourself, Matt. I for one can say 'groin strain', 'the boy done well' and 'it's a game of two halves' in every language known to man. Yours not only a 'southerner' but a Londoner born and bred (lay orf me barrer), <b>Gertie</b>. </i> <p> <font size=4><b> DETAILS DETAILS</b></font><br> I've been collecting <i>YS</i> since issue 20 and I wouldn't dream of swapping to another Spectrum magazine. <i>(You mean there are other Spectrum magazines? Ya live and learn. Ed)</i> But I have some complaints. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) Please start printing your compos on the back of adverts and not reviews. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) I have written hundreds of letters to <i>Input/Output</i> and none have been printed except the first one I sent. Why? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) I enter all your compos in every magazine and have spent &pound;15 on stamps but never won anything. I usually enter on the same day as I buy the issue, so if you restrict the compos to the first 100 entries then I might stand a chance. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4) Please make your Letters section bigger. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5) Why were there no Compo Winners in the June issue? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6) I think Madame Pico is very cruel to the people that write to him/her! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7) Can I say hello to Andrew Turner? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from these few points I think your mag is the best in the world. <br> <b> Martin Bastack <br> Birmingham <br> </b> <br><i> Well, what can I say except... 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) YOU tell the advertisers. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) What's wrong with that? You got one printed, didn't you? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) Even if we restricted it to 100, there'll still be no guarantee you'd win. That's a 100-1 shot, and no bookie I know would give you tuppence for those odds. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4) Erm, surely if we made it bigger it wouldn't fit in the mag?! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5) Mind your own business. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6) So do I. Think yourself lucky she isn't answering YOUR letter. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7) No you can't. <b>Ed</b>. </i> <p> <TABLE align=center BORDER BGCOLOR=cyan BACKGROUND=""><TR><TD> <table align=left><tr><td align=center><IMG src="../thumbs/letters/trainspotter.jpg"><br><font size=5><B>TRAINSPOTTER<br>AWARD</b></font></td></tr></table><font size=4><b> HI EYE QUEUE</b></font><br> Eye hav bean reeding your magazeen four kwite sum tyme, and eye lyke thu Leturz pagez beekoz eye kan praktis mye reeding.
