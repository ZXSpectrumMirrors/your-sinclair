<div>It's taken a lo-o-o-o-ong 
time for this game to 
make it to a 
commercial release, as 
I first saw it umpteen 
moons ago when 
author Garry Cappucinni 
sent it in for review. Gary 
was planning to publish it 
himself under the awful title 
of '<I>Snap</I>', the first in a 
proposed trilogy. The other 
two were to be called - you 
guessed it - '<I>Crackle</I>' and 
'<I>Pop</I>'. I sent it back for the 
unusual reason that I 
thought it was simply too 
good! Too good to be wasted 
by trying to sell it himself 
and maybe only flogging a 
few copies, when he ought to 
be getting on with writing 
the sequels. I suggested he 
get a software house to 
publish it - and that he 
change the title. So here it 
is, published by Zenobi 
Software as <I>Crack City</I>, the 
first part of the <I>Snow Dogs 
Trilogy</I>. A vast improvement 
on <I>Snap</I>! 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The game takes place in 
the near future, with you 
playing the part of a secret 
agent in the Secret 
Intelligence Foundation. The 
setting is New Washington, a 
city built to support 
Washington's increasing 
administration side and the 
north-east USA's ever-growing population. As a 
result of a Mafia drugs 
operation which is being 
uncovered, you've been 
called back from your 
holiday in the Maldives. And 
I wish I had a fiver for every 
secret agent who's been 
called back from holiday in 
order to star in an adventure 
game! But that's the only 
cliche, the rest is fresh and 
well thought-out. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, you get to choose 
which of three secret agents 
you want to be. There's Mick 
Hammelford, who scores 
well on the shooting range 
but will never be 
heavyweight champion of 
the world; Louis Chorbenski, 
a Polish giant whose brain 
rattles about in his head like 
a pea in a whistle; and 
finally Ed Macpherson, who's 
English and a general all-round good egg. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Crack City</I> was written 
using <I>PAWS</I>, but you'll never 
believe it when you see the 
screen layout, with its 
changing graphics, icons, 
complex status line and 
loads of other features. It'll 
give <I>PAWS</I> users heart 
attacks as they try to figure 
out how it's been done. In 
the graphics section at the 
top of the screen there's 
more information than you'll 
find in the average MI5 
Filofax. If there had only 
been the 3D perspective 
graphic of each location that 
would have been 
impressive 
enough, but that 
takes up a small 
portion of the 
screen and is 
surrounded by 
other information. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the left a 
series of icons 
shows the 
available exits in 
white, or grey if 
not currently 
available. This 
changes if you find 
a secret exit by 
searching around.
The faces shown 
also change, as 
characters appear 
and disappear in the same location 
as yourself - 
nurses, policemen and even 
Dwight, your faithful 
assistant, who's given to 
wandering in and out 
looking lost 'til you tell him 
to stick with you. Oh yes, 
you can talk to all these 
characters as well, although 
that's subject to the usual 
problems that speech in an 
adventure throws' up. A lot of 
people spend a lot of time 
saying "Hi" to each other. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the right a section is 
given over to the objects 
you're carrying, showing how 
close you are to the 
maximum permitted in your 
hands, your pocket, your 
wallet and so on. This isn't 
just a gimmick, as it does 
help if you look at them to 
see if you can pick up one 
more object, or need to put 
something down first. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Below this little lot is the 
status line, showing the time 
of day, your cash, skill level, 
SIF rating, mortality level, 
score and number of turns 
taken. Again, they're not just 
put there for show, most are 
an integral part of the game 
- if it's night you'll need to 
sleep, if your mortality 
level's low and your turns 
are increasing, watch out. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It helps to have these 
things permanently visible 
on the screen, rather than 
have to keep typing separate 
commands for each one. 
You'd spend so much time 
checking on your status 
you'd never find time to do 
anything! And if you're 
worried that all this stuff is 
bound to slow the game 
down, then think again. 
Everything appears almost 
instantly, and that includes 
the graphics. Half a second 
and they're there, a 
testament to the 
programmer, to <I>PAWS</I> and to 
the good old Spectrum. If, 
however, you don't want all 
this stuff, you can just as 
easily switch it all off and 
play <I>Crack City</I> as a straight 
text adventure, with all the 
sophisticated commands that 
<I>PAWS</I> allows, like multiple 
inputs, OOPS, RAMSAVE 
and so on. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what of the gameplay 
itself? Well, inevitably with 
all these memory-hungry 
features, it doesn't have the 
depth of a Dungeon 
Adventure, let's be honest. 
But the author's done his 
best to make the problems 
more complex, and that 
works better in a game with 
fewer locations: Your first 
task is to find something to 
eat, which means not being 
distracted by each and every 
problem you'll encounter 
near the start - get out there 
and find something to 
munch! I did get a bit 
annoyed when I kept dying 
of hunger, but it's a sign of 
how engrossing the game is 
that although I thought it 
was happening every few 
moves, in fact I'd taken 78 
turns on one occasion and 
not realised it. My score 
slowly improved too. First a 
shameful 2%... then 7%... 
then 12%...  a reason to keep 
playing. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not that you'll need much 
reason to keep playing 
<I>Crack City</I> - you'll play it 
because you want to. The 
game is quite simply 
brilliant, and puts most 
home-grown adventures to 
shame, A few years ago it 
would have been snapped up 
by someone like 
Mastertronic or Firebird and 
sold thousands, no doubt 
about it. Never mind, it's 
available, that's all that 
matters, and discerning 
adventurers will be adding it 
to their collections without 
delay.
