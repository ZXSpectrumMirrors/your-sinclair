<div>"The dreams of children are the 
games of men." So says the 
Balrog at the start of his new 
game, and who am I to argue? 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This latest from the Zenobi 
stable (they can't afford a house yet) is 
another double-sider, with two full-length 
adventures on one tape - terrific 
value for money. On the 'B' side is <I>A 
Legacy For Alaric</I>, which is the first 
Zenobi game not to be written by John 
Wilson. Instead it's by a certain Palmer P 
Eldritch, and for the usual used fiver I'll 
tell anyone who that really is. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's a text-only tale done on <I>PAWS,</I> and 
pretty spanky it is too. You're late for 
work on your first day at the 
Adventurers' Guild, but that doesn't stop 
you getting lumbered with a job to do. 
The wise wizard Emril is dying and 
wants to leave his legacy to his only heir, 
Alaric, who's unfortunately held prisoner 
in a castle dungeon on an island in the 
middle of a lake - does something tell 
you this ain't gonna be easy? It could be 
worth it, though, for if you succeed you'll 
cop for one-tenth of the legacy (less the 
usual 70% for the Guild pension scheme, 
running costs and stuff). 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dumped at the side of a road in a 
snow-covered landscape, you're 
thankfully wearing a thick coat and 
shoes, and your hessian sack contains 
those oh-so-familiar objects, a rope and 
a torch. Mind you, the torch doesn't 
work. Typical Guild craftsmanship. The 
game's been written by someone who 
loves his adventures, with quite a few 
tongue-in-cheek references to other 
games, and a few send-ups along the 
way. The problems often have the ring of 
familiarity too, like being asked to 
deliver a letter, and having to hide in a 
bush to catch someone opening a door. 
But as well as something borrowed 
there's also plenty new, and the game 
easily stands up in its own right, not just 
as a giveaway 'B' side. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 'A' side sees us back in more 
familiar Zenobi territory, with our old 
chum Bulbo putting in an appearance 
right at the start - even if it is only in 
the introduction. He can't explore the 
world of <I>Retarded Creatures And Caverns</I> 
himself, as the invite he gets to turn up 
at Castle Toidi on the 25th sadly clashes 
with him having to receive some sort of 
adventure club award on behalf of Zenobi 
Software. So Bulbo nips next door and 
persuades his neighbour Algernon to go 
to the castle in his place. If you think 
Algernon isn't a very heroic name you're 
dead right. But it suits him! 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pretty soon he's before the great oak 
door of Castle Toidi - first problem, 
how to get through it? Bulbo's given him 
a map, but that's no use as it's 
completely blank except for the words 
"Drawn by Krazy Kez Gray" at the top. 
At first I thought we were in for another 
one-location Zenobi game, and it took 
me an enjoyable half-hour to examine 
everything I could find and work out how 
to get the door to open... and stay open. 
A wider vocabulary would have helped, 
as I was on the right track but couldn't 
quite phrase it to suit the program. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once inside the castle you find a 
dragon sitting on the biggest pile of gold 
you've ever seen in your life, and beyond 
the dragon is a tunnel. No prizes for 
guessing what the next problem is. In 
order to get to the tunnel you have to 
satisfy the dragon (oo-er), and also deal 
with the problem of the handle on the 
wall. If you just PULL HANDLE you get 
fried alive, so you have to devise some 
way of standing back from it - like 
maybe a length of rope or something 
similar? Now try as I might I couldn't find 
any rope anywhere, so I resorted to the 
HELP command and after working out 
the code I read that to get some string 
you should UNRAVEL VEST. For the life 
of me I couldn't figure out how you're 
supposed to know that you're wearing a 
vest. I went back and played the game 
from the start, but no mention was made 
of a vest. I tried to EXAMINE 
CLOTHES, EXAMINE ME, EXAMINE 
MYSELF, EXAMINE ALGY, REMOVE 
COAT and all manner of things, and in 
the end just typed UNRAVEL VEST to 
give me that precious piece of string. So 
come on, Balrog, it's black marks unless 
you can tell me how you discover the 
vest. But he may be in the clear - when 
I'd got the string I tried to drop it only to 
be told "Not held!" But of course I was 
holding it, so maybe I'd got my vest in a 
twist by unravelling it before finding it. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are the usual amusing 
responses to ordinary inputs like 
REMOVE BOOTS - "Algy thought 
about it, but then decided not to, just in 
case he trod in something squelchy." And 
as for DROP ALL, you're told "Algy 
wasn't carrying any 'ALL'. (Sorry, 
Ekim... hee!
hee!)" I may be
wrong but I think
someone's taking 
the YEKCIM here. 
You later find a 
wand which bears 
the great piece 
of advice, "Wave 
this wand near a 
dragon's bum, and
he'll become your
faithful chum." 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parser 
could have been 
better as there's a 
sheet of instructions, but you        
can't GET SHEET, you can only GET
INSTRUCTIONS. There ought to have 
been room for both, as the Balrog's 
dispensed with his usual mass of silly 
inputs in order to concentrate on the 
program. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no matter, as well as being up to 
Zenobi's high standards for humour (and 
John Wilson's definitely taken over where 
Delta 4 left off in that respect), <I>Retarded 
Creatures And Caverns</I> also gets full 
marks for its problem-solving - most 
funny games are often just 'page-turners' 
when it comes to the adventure element, 
but not this one. You have to search and 
examine everything, look in and under 
things, push, pull, turn and lift 
everything in sight, and come up with 
some pretty imaginative solutions to 
problems. Top-notch stuff.
