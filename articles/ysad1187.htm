"Dear Sir Gerrard," the first letter begins. Unfortunately it's not from the Palace, just from <b>Nick Turner</b> of Normanton, who says that <I>Gremlins</I> is driving him to the bottle. Hmm, I must load it up again myself in that case. The specific problem is what to do with the smashed vents. Obvious, you twit, you fix them. Oh, you want to know how. I see, well take the HCROT DNA EPIP and SETALP DLEW, but not the one in the hardware department. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Jeff Bird</b> of Cardiff is having vocabulary trouble - mainly his lack of it. In <I>The 'O' Zone</I> he says he's wearing the bucket to get past the robot leader, but now he needs it to put some acid in and he can't drop it as the program tells him he hasn't got it. A lack of vocabulary in the program too, I think. Though if you're wearing something in an adventure you normally have to remove it before you can drop it. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing as mundane as bucket trouble for <b>David Brankin</b>, from Thornbury. David's being given the runaround by a couple of dragons. The first is in <I>Castle Blackstar</I>: "How do I move the dragon after slaying it?" The answer is that you don't, you have to kill it from another direction otherwise it just blocks the way and can't be moved. In the same game, to kill the hydra you must DAERBREGNIG WORHT, which the heads will fight over, and you kill off the remaining head with any weapon. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other dragon problem is in <I><a href="thepawn.htm">The Pawn</a></I>, and to get past this one you first SWODAHS TA ETIHW ENIHS and then you SWODAHS TA TNIOP. As to whether you should use the blue key on the safe and vote, or on the door and save the princess, I'd say you should vote every time. The princess isn't worth it. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A letter next from 'Dejected of Dorset', alias <b>J Meaning</b> of Throop, who asks for solutions on <I>Imagination</I> and <I><a href="tolkientrilogy.htm">The Hobbit</a></I>, but without sending the required sae. Not that I have freebies available for those two games anyway, but if 'Dejected' would like to write in with a sae for a list of the available freebies, I'd be happy to supply one. That goes for anyone else out there, too, whether dejected, defective or just plain demented. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Michael Palmer</b> of Newquay asks how to deal with the dinosaur (KCITS WORHT) and get past the fence (ETUHCARAP ESU) in <I><a href="adventuregreats.htm">Eureka</a></I>, and how to deal with the guards in <I><a href="adventuregreats.htm">Valkyrie 17</a></I> (MEHT TOOHS). 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some tips from <b>Anthony Prash</b>, Sheffield, who would also like to hear from anyone who's playing any of the same games. In <I>Necris Dome</I>, make sure you have the oxy exchanger before initiating destruction; in <I>Star Wreck</I> plug the spark in to get the safe combination; in <I>Lifeterm</I> send an SOS to get things going; and in <I>Wiz Biz</I> use the vacuum to dispose of the spectre and remember that fire demons like junk food. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Simon Purdoe</b> (I think that's his surname) of Botley near Southampton asks a few things about <I>The Never Ending Story</I> because he says his copy is just gathering dust on the shelf till he can solve these problems. Right, blow off the dust and load it up again, Simon. To find the crystal you need to get past the thorns into the tunnel in the mountains, and for that you ERIFPMAC TA HCNARB THGIL, and then you SNROHT THGIL. Don't worry about the cape, and spend as little time as possible in the swamplands. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ron White</b> of Mexborough says he's known as Rodders, which I thought was the name for a plonker. He must be a plonker, as he's sent me a solution to <I><a href="adventuregreats.htm">Bored Of The Rings</a></I>, which I've been offering as a freebie for yonks. Or maybe he isn't, as I didn't include the passwords on mine, so for the benefit of everyone who's asked about those in the past, here they are: GOODTIME, Trevor and Derek, NOT TELLING. Be sure to get your upper and lower case letters right. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A couple of useful hints to speed up play on <I>Very Big Cave Adventure</I> from <b>Trevor Taylor</b> of York. At the beginning you don't need to go through all the routines of wearing the wellies and dealing with the bull, as the 'magic' words "SAY COMMODORE" will transport you to the caves right from the start, and not merely after you've discovered it. In the beginning was the word, and the word was Commodore. What??? Never mind, Commodore owners have to "SAY SPECTRUM", and Amstrad owners have to "SAY SUGAR". Trevor's other clue is for those of you who know rude words, which I'm sure is very few of our well-behaved YS readers. At Gotham City you don't need to capture the Jester to get a lift back to the caves, all you do is swear, and then when you get out of the swear box you're back in the main game. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>M A Squiggle</b> in Whitchurch (that's what the signature looks like, anyway) asks about the DO command in <I><a href="tolkientrilogy.htm">The Hobbit</a></I>, which I mentioned back in the June issue. What is this mysterious command? Well in an early version of the program they hoped to include a command that the player could use: DO MAGIC. That would provide you with a magical way of dealing with some of the problems. Then it was decided to take this out and let you deal with the problems in a non-magical way, like smashing things up with your sword. But it obviously wasn't taken out successfully as using the word DO in your input can cause strange things to happen. It's worth trying if you're getting tired of playing and are about to switch off anyway, as it can cause the program to crash. "And why does Thorin keep singing about gold?" this same inquisitive reader wants to know. Well, some people are just like that. Mike sits down and starts singing, <I>"Baby it's gold outside."</I> <b>Nic Malone</b>, of wonderful Wigan, is busy singing the praises of Delta 4 and <I><a href="colourofmagic.htm">The Colour Of Magic</a></I>, except for the fact that he can't get out of the burning city in part two. Despite reading the solution we printed, Nic can't get Twoflower to co-operate by riding one of the horses. I know the solution works because I've played it through, and all I can think of is that maybe you're not bothering to do something in part one that looks fairly unimportant, and that's having repercussions later (this month's big word). Anyone else come across a bolshie Twoflower and worked out the reason why? Nic finishes by asking if they're going to be adapting the sequel, <I>The Light Fantastic</I> It's no use asking me, Nic, I know nothing, but if Piranha are listening, what are the chances? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>J R Evory</b> and <b>Andrew Dobson</b> of East Yorkshire want to know what to do with the Silver Socle in <I><a href="kayleth.htm">Kayleth</a></I>, and how to stop the walls crushing you in the citadel. The answer to both being ELCOS RETNE. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, enter <b>John Clifton</b> of London SE3 with a couple of queries about <I>Colditz</I>. How to find the combination to the armoury and how to climb all the way up the chimney? If you can do the second, then you can discover the first. To get further up the chimney you mustn't mind who you tread on (RENOSIRP ESU), and although you can't go all the way up, when you get a bit higher you can YLLUFERAC NETSIL. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few tips from <b>Gregory Quinn</b> of Portadown, in <I>Demon From The Darkside</I>: to get Stodge the Dwarf you must drop all and take him, but don't forget to retake the smoke and teleport spells. And in <I><a href="thegoldenmask.htm">The Golden Mask</a></I>, don't take the mask till you've read the scroll of Voltac. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just to show that <I>Your Sinclair</I> and the adventure pages aren't only read by trainspotters, loonies and general layabouts; the latest mailbag contained letters from a teacher, a freelance photographer, a doctor from Virginia Water and a retired Major from Taunton. Yet not even the Major won a <I>YS</I> badge, what a shame. But last and by all means least, my old pal <b>Ricardo Mapp</b> is back on the map, giving me his list of the ten worst points in adventure games. They are instant deaths; excessive use of random elements; the word-game syndrome (eg DON GLOVE in <I>Time Machine</I> when WEAR GLOVE doesn't work); illogical mazes where each room has about ten exits, and nine of them all lead back to the same place; illogical solutions to problems (eg <I>Moron</I> in the room where 'The exit is not obvious' and you have to type OBSCURE); being able to finish with less than 100%; brilliant artwork that misleads you into thinking an adventure is better than it is; lack of time to solve a problem (eg two inputs before the dragon kills you); very slow responses (eg <I>Smuggler's Cove</I>, though there are very few as slow as that around these days); and objects which are not mentioned in the text, but you're meant to be able to identify from a badly drawn picture (eg the safe in <I><a href="adventuregreats.htm">Valkyrie 17</a></I> and the blob in the rock that's a keyhole in <I>Terrors of Trantoss</I>). Some provocative thoughts there, most of which, I agree with - anyone else got any pet hates that Ricardo's missed out?
