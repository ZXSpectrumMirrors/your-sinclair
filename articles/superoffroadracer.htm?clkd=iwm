<b><I>Ivan 'Ironman' 
Stewart's Super Off-Road 
Racer</I> (phew) is without doubt 
this month's winner of the longest, most-difficult-to-say name award. 
(Congratulations.) It's also, like another 
game reviewed not a million miles from 
here (see below [Domarks' "Spy Who Loved Me" - NickH]), basically a modern 
update of an ancient arcade classic 
(<I>Supersprint</I> in this case, not <I><a href="historyinthemaking.htm">Spy Hunter</a></I>). 
But that's where the similarity ends, 'cos 
whereas <I>The Spy Who Loved</I> Me seems 
only to have earned a cautious thumbs-up, 
<I>Ironman</I> is an absolute stonker!</b>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those wise Spec-chums who bought last 
month's <I>YS</I> should know quite a lot about the 
game by now anyway. After all, we gave away a 
rather spanking little playable demo on the cover 
cassette, as well as splashing the thing all over the 
front of the magazine. For the others among you 
(where were you?) what happens is that you, and a 
pal if you've got one, compete in a series of races 
around a set of twisty, turny off-road circuits, 
jumping over ridges, avoiding mud holes and 
trying not to spin off at the corners (if you can 
possibly help it). 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tracks are all rather small 
(small enough to fit into a single
screen, so there's no call for any 
complicated scrolling or 
anything) meaning the trucks 
are tiny little things whizzing 
about the place. Tiny, but very 
well animated - there are 
apparently over 100 different 
little truck sprites which the 
computer keeps switching 
between to keep everything 
looking as it should! 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, erm, that's about it really. I could go on 
about the shop sequence which appears at the end 
of each race (allowing you to upgrade your truck 
with new shock absorbers, nitrous oxide injection 
and so on), or the eight different circuits you play 
through at random, or the credit system that can 
count as extra goes or upgrades for your vehicle, 
but they're just icing on the cake - it's the thrills 'n' 
spills (lots of spills!) of the actual game that makes 
<I>Ironman</I> so much fun. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if you think it's fun on your own, just wait 
until you get your chum involved! This is one of 
those games that two-player mode was invented 
for (unfortunately they don't seem to have been 
able to fit in the three-player option from the 
arcades). The bouncy, up-and-down nature of the 
circuits and number of hazards (mud holes, pools, 
you name it) make for a sufficiently crazy anything-can-happen sort of a race on their own - you just 
can't help hitting other cars and bouncing about 
all over the place. But get another guy involved 
and the temptation to keep ramming him and/or 
running him off the road is irresistible. You can 
even (hee hee) decide to zoom off the wrong way 
round the track (!), ploughing head-first into the 
racers who are taking it seriously half-way round! 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, it's not just the simple, accessible 
game design that makes <I>Ironman</I> so good - the 
Codies, for instance, have done hundreds of 
similar things, albeit with a simpler perspective 
and none of the interesting bouncy up-and-down 
bits. It's the skill with which it's been programmed. 
Graftgold (last responsible for the Speccy 
<I><a href="rainbowislands.htm">Rainbow Islands</a></I>) are the blokes behind it, and 
they've managed to incorporate lots of colour, very 
little clash, and get everything jumping around 
incredibly quickly. And it all loads in one go as 
well. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faults? There aren't any really. I think the fact 
that there aren't actually all that many circuits 
could cut down on life expectancy a bit (though 
you go round each one in both directions, making 
it seem like there are more), but apart from that it 
achieves what it sets out to do more or less 
perfectly. In case you hadn't guessed already, I 
love <I>Ironman</I>. For my money this is one of the 
most fun games of the year, and the best 
<I>Supersprint</I>-type game I've ever played (much 
better than the original was on our rubber.keyed 
chum, that's for sure). The business, and no 
mistake.
