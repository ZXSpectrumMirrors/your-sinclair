A quick tip from <b>J Creighton</b> of Haverhill to start with, on a game not often mentioned, which is why I'm mentioning it, and that's <I>Mr McKenzie</I> from Software Projects. The tip? EWOKS RULE OK. Means nothing to me, but what's new about that? And who says the Scots are mean? Not me, for one, as I've been sent too many solutions from north of the border to believe that old story. And thanks to <b>Angus Northcott</b> of Midlothian for another one, on <I><a href="dracula.htm">Dracula</a></I>, even though <b>John Barnsley</b> beat you to it and his solution has been serialised in these very pages. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitely the first person in with tips on <I><a href="shadowsofmordor.htm">Shadows Of Mordor</a></I> is <b>Steven Conibear</b> of Birmingham. Watch for where Smeagol goes most often then GNIR RAEW and TIAW and EPOR YERG HTIW LOGAEMS EIT. Then when he asks you to MIH EITNU say "No" till he makes a ESIMORP. Then say ESIMORP yourself before you EPOR EITNU. If you need a branch: DROWS HTIW EERT TUC and to move a rock: HCNARB HTIW REVEL. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And probably almost certainly definitely the first to complete <I><a href="thebigsleaze.htm">The Big Sleaze</a></I> is <b>Peter Bates</b> of Leeds who finished it on 3rd June, before it was even released! This amazing feat was possible because Peter got a review copy of the game through a fanzine he writes for, so he says he won't claim the honour of being the 'true' first person to complete the game. How noble of you, Peter, and thanks for the tips! To open the safe ELOHYEK NI ETIMANYD TRESNI. If you don't want to read backwards and just want a hint then the pig's bottom is a clue! At Joe's Diner: TELIOT NI LLAW ENIMAXE. To decode the note just ETON EDOCED! In the library: SGNIHT REPSIHW YLNO. Peter saw that lots of people were stuck in <I>Necris Dome</I> so he went out and bought a copy. His verdict? "Written on the <I>GAC</I> (written poorly as well) with incredibly boring repetitive graphics. I got to the end and still only scored 12%!" 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Politer comments about Atlantis's <I>Supercom</I> from <b>Robert Morgan</b> of Glasgow, who'd like to thank the Kind Souls who came to his rescue on that one. "It only costs &pound;1.99," he says, "and is one of the better games I've played." To find the level 2 code on that one is a complicated business, so this one is definitely being written in a forwards direction. "First take a note of the three characters supplied from TELSTAR when you enter the Armageddon computer serial number," says Robert. "These are the first three of the level 2 code. Next are the first three characters of the real engine number, which you get when you call UK Data, and the last three are the first three of the paint number of the car which you find when you call FALCON. I know it sounds complicated but it does make more sense when you're actually playing the game." I should hope so, Robert! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next we have a POKE from Penryn, from <b>Andrew Thomas</b>. Andrew says this one definitely works using Multiface One but doesn't know whether it can be integrated into the loader. It's for Part Two of <I><a href="theboggit.htm">The Boggit</a></I> and if you want to stop the goblins throwing you in the dungeon when you've just escaped then POKE 17307,0. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Barrie Bishop</b>'s having trouble in <I><a href="adventuregreats.htm">Adventureland</a></I>, trying to find the last two treasures. To help with the ones you haven't got, you should rub the lamp once in the maze and then a second time elsewhere, but turn it off first and only rub it twice. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Steve Clayton</b> of Southend-on-Sea asks if I've ever considered a telephone helpline, maybe for just a couple of hours a week, as having to wait for a reply in the post is sometimes frustrating. Yes I've considered it, Steve, for about 0.00001 of a second. I'm afraid tying up a telephone line and someone's time at a set time every week is just not possible in a busy magazine office, where chaos rules. As for your suggestion that Kind 'Souls might give their phone numbers, I received a letter from <b>Hugh Walker</b> a few days before yours in which he offered to be a Kind Soul but asked me not to publish his phone number. His reason is that when it was published in another magazine he received calls late into the night, and also had calls from people who thought it was amusing just to shout obscenities down the phone. That kind of call isn't funny, especially when young children might answer the phone,- but I will reply to letters asap, promise, except when I'm on one of my frequent holidays to Barbados, Hawaii, Jamaica, Florida... <I>(How much are we paying you? Ed) </I> 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to <b>Andrew Edney</b> of London for being first in with several solutions: <I><a href="dodgygeezers.htm">Dodgy Geezers</a></I> and <I><a href="sydneyaffair.htm">The Sidney Affair</a></I> among them, so readers who were asking questions about those adventures now stand a chance of getting them answered. Andrew sends some tips for <I><a href="lizardking.htm">Bulbo And The Lizard King</a></I>, too. To pass the rat: REDLUOB EHT LLOR. To get rid of the spider: PLEH ROF FRAWD EHT KSA. What use is the lizard: GNIRREH DER A. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Peter Walsh</b> of Shaw says he's read advice from some readers that you should start <I><a href="eddiesmith.htm">Journey To The Centre Of Eddie Smith's Head</a></I> by driving to Eddie's house. He has one word to say: DON'T! He says the problem with that is that the cat is in the maze and has to be dealt with straight away otherwise it simply starts to appear at random. And that's a bit of a catastrophe. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Richard Batey</b> asks how to deal with the boulder and that rockfall in <I><a href="thepawn.htm">The Pawn</a></I>. We all know that the only thing you do with a boulder in an adventure game is to lever it. Question is, what with? TRIHS HTIW REHTEGOT EKAR DNA EOH EIT. As for the rockfall: TI REVO BMILC. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Glenn Hayman</b> of Maidstone came up with the tip about dealing with the boulder, and also how to move the floorboard in the tree house. First you must ROOD ESOLC and then you just DRAOB HSUP. Thanks to <b>Andrew Rowan</b> of Mansfield as well for a solution to <I><a href="thepawn.htm">The Pawn</a></I> up to the point where you encounter the dragon. To deal with that is about the silliest and most irritating part of <I><a href="thepawn.htm">The Pawn</a></I>, requiring a lot of guessing and two instant fussy inputs rather than a genuine problem-solve. First you SWODAHS TA ETIHW ENIHS then you SWODAHS TA TNIOP. Try EXAMINE ME for a laugh, Andrew says. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bit of help-swopping is wanted by <b>Darren Roy</b> of Billericay, Essex. Help wanted on <I>Spiderman</I>, and help both available and wanted on <I>Moron</I>. In the latter, to open the safe refer to the tattoo on the dead captain. When in the Silent Room: TUOHS. To get the magnetic card: REMMAH HTIW SSALG KAERB. Darren's <I>Moron</I>-ic questions: how do you fit the handle to the door, how do you fire the rifle or pistol, how do you get out of the waste disposal chute, how do you unstick the lever on the flight deck and what use is the message "N&lt;flux&gt;5" that you find? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Alan Skidmore</b> of Worthing is stuck in <I><a href="kobyashinaru.htm">Kobyashi Naru</a></I>, wondering how to deal with the droids in the 'Understanding' section. First you TIP OTNI LEEHW WORHT then you DOIRDREVOH PMUJ and finally you should HCREP ESYLANA. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Moira Evans</b> of Swindon says she liked my review of <I><a href="custerdsquest.htm">Custerd's Quest</a></I> and wanted to buy it - but no address was given. Shame on me. I only usually give addresses for releases that are mail order only, and as <I><a href="custerdsquest.htm">Custerd's Quest</a></I> is on the Power House label which belongs to CRL, it should be available in the shops. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Help on that game is requested by <b>Graham</b> 'The most rubbish adventurer in the universe' <b>Partner</b> of Uxbridge. Well he said it, not me. How do you get past the peasants at the gate? NIOC WORHT. Can you get out of the pit under the storeroom? It's just an area of darkness, Graham, not a pit, and you should keep moving east till you're given a torch. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>John Robson</b> of Northumberland describes himself as 'One near desperate Geordie', and describes <I>Terrors Of Trantoss</I> as "A reet cramper." Feel free to use it in the advertising, Ariolasoft. ("A reet cramper," John Robson.) How to deal with the fanglizard: ETAG ESOLC. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally a letter I can't possibly leave out, from <b>C Woodings</b> of Tamworth: "The June 1987 issue was the first time I purchased your magazine and I was delighted to see that you can offer help on <I>The Secret Of St Brides</I>. I have written to three other magazines but none have been able to be of any assistance." Oh well, shucks (blushes modestly), it's all part of the service. Now can I have a rise please, T'zer? What's that? Answer the problem first... oh yes, sorry, nearly forgot, didn't I? How to return the cat, that's the problem, having gone to the island and got it, how do you get back? "I would be most grateful if you could help me because I have been stuck on that island since August 1986!" Cripes! Well that's really the program's fault, and not yours, as although you can no longer see the boat and it looks like it's gone you can still BOARD BOAT to get back and return the cat. And what use is the fire extinguisher asks this same anguished reader? REVEOSTAHW ENON.
