After many months spent waiting for a suitable candidate, once again a Manuel award can be made for games playing below and beneath the call of duty. This seems appropriate as I only got back from a holiday in Spain five days ago, and a waiter in one restaurant did indeed do his best to keep the Manuel spirit alive, by attempting to remove everyone's plate before we'd finished eating. Hard not to laugh when we're holding onto the plates saying 'No.. no..' and he's tugging at them saying 'Si.. si..' And this wasn't in Barcelona. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, the Manuel award this time goes to <b>Paul Greenough</b> of Radcliffe in Manchester, who, after years of playing computer games, has just finished his first one ever, and that's <I><a href="roguetrooper.htm">Rogue Trooper</a></I>. Naturally this might disqualify him from earning the coveted Manuel trophy, but he receives it because he still hasn't finished a single adventure game. He's been struggling along with <I>Marie Celeste</I> for some time, and after a mention in these pages last year he was sent several complete solutions and full maps to the game by kind-hearted readers, but Paul reports that he still hasn't managed to finish it! The Android gets him every time. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to all of you who spotted my own Manuel qualities in my review of <I><a href="bugsy.htm">Bugsy</a></I> where it was obvious that I wasn't getting very far. Too many clues and solutions came in to be able to list you all, but I must mention <b>Andy Howie</b> of Fife who says it's the only adventure he's ever finished, but he managed to do it in five hours. Obviously a hoodlum in the making there. For those struggling to get started, as I was, you have to be a bold bunny and SDOOH KCATTA. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Matthew Ascroft</b> of Birmingham also helped with <I><a href="bugsy.htm">Bugsy</a></I> and if you're still stuck in part two just send me an sae for more help on that. Where to get out of the school in <I>St Bride's</I>? The answer lies near the broom closet. Open doors, use pencils in keyholes and put newspapers under doors to catch keys. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Trantoss</I> trouble for <b>Don Markwick</b> of Eastbourne, who wonders how to open the Great Door in the Valley of Vendas Vane and also how to raise the Portcullis. For the first, just FFATS HTIW ROOD KCONK, and for the second you have to part the brothers. Send Lobo empty-handed to NATROM FO YELLAV EHT and there he should REDLUOB EKAT. Return to Portcullis, send him east, then BALS NO DNATS and BALS NO REDLUOB PORD. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right, I'm going to give you a lot of Bull now. So what's new, everyone shouts at once. Oh shut up, I'm talking about <b>Wren Bull</b> from Carmarthen, who started life as a <I>Lost Soul</I> (his adventuring life, that is) but is now up there among the elite by being first to finish <I><a href="kobyashinaru.htm">Kobyashi Naru</a></I>. He started the game at 8.00pm on 30th March and finished it 2hrs 50mins later. About one minute after that he wrote to me to tell me about it. The next day he wrote again with a solution and map, and told me his brother Paul had now finished the game as well! Definitely a bull's eye for the Bull brothers, and no reflection on the ease or difficulty of the game as letters are now coming in from people stuck in it. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blow me down if there wasn't another bundle of Bull blather a few days later, this time 'cos he'd seen the May issue and offered to answer <b>Chris Jones</b>'s plea for help on <I>Nectis Dome</I>, seeing as I didn't print Chris's address. What me, not print an address? The very idea. Anyhow, Wren says that once you've climbed out of the casket, NIAGA NI KCAB BMILC to find the gloves. To kill the mandroid in Reception Room 10 you EXA HTIW EPIP RETAW TOH POHC. Then don't fail to examine the mandroid carefully. The circuit diagram in Reception 9 MARGAID LLUP RO HSUP. This reveals a panel, then you SNOTTUB LLA SSERP. In Reception 11 you have to TINU LASOPSID NI DIORDNAM TUP. If anyone's solved the game and is prepared to help Wren finish it, write to him at Carmarthen, Dyfed. Just to keep the record straight, <b>Chris Jones</b> lives at Formby, Lancs, and is keen to hear from anyone who'd like to swop second-hand adventures, like <I>Circus</I> and <I>Waxworks</I> in particular. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Jamie Young</b> of Slough needs help on <I>The Helm</I>. Well, Jamie, you need to cross the river to get to the spectacles, which are just a couple of moves north, but to get across the river you need to SENOTS PORD. You need the bag to carry the salt and the diamond is incredibly useful later on, almost at the end of the adventure when you must insert it somewhere (no rude comments please). 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Help to some <I>Lost Souls</I> from <b>Matthew Conway</b> of somewhere in Berks. For <b>Daren Francis</b> who's stuck in <I>McKensie</I> - to get past the first room type ROOD NEPO and when asked 'With what?' type PILC. For <b>J. Grundy</b> who's wondering how to enter the tomb in <I><a href="farilight128.htm">Fairlight</a></I>, you must be wearing the crown, and the strange thing on the dungeon floor is probably a red herring. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Toby Blake</b> who runs the <I>Helping Hand</I> helpline service from Inverness, Scotland, asks me to put in a plea to his members to send in some tips, maps, clues, solutions or <I>anything</I>. It seems like most of the members are the equivalent of overdrawn - they're asking lots of questions but giving nothing in return. Come on chaps and chappesses, helplines are a two-way thing. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd like to thank <b>Greg Quinn</b> of Portadown for his <I>Fantastic Four</I> freebie. Now if only I could read his writing I might be able to use it. I can read <b>Adam Bennett</b>'s writing, mainly because he uses a typewriter, and he wants to know how to start the orchestra in <I>Zzzzz</I>, the answer to which is NOTAB ESIAR. To capture the white horse in <I>Sinbad</I> you just ESROH OOSSAL. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd like to thank Weymouth Adventurers Inc for sending me a full solution to <I>St Brides</I>, as the one I'd previously been sent only dealt with the first half of the game. In that first half, though, <b>Robert Morgan</b> from Scotstoun in Glasgow wonders where to find the gold to pay the dwarf at the ferry. Go to the foothills and KCOR ENIMAXE then KCARC ENIMAXE. What use is the catmint? You'll find out when you've used the ferry. And what is the 'modern magic' that the Firborg demands to see - TUO TI BUR NEHT REPAP NO ETIRW. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Graham Collier</b> of Bath uses the modern magic of taped letters to communicate with me, and the latest one I loaded in offers some advice on <I>Se-Kaa Of Assiah</I>. Graham says that you don't need to breathe with the blowpipe underwater, though if you do breathe once then you must breathe again a second time while returning to the surface or you'll drown. Graham points out that it's the insertion of the blowpipe into the mesh underwater that increases your score, not the actual taking of the casket. The harness doesn't need to be taken to the top of the tower, he adds. Your score before mounting Sebac should be 30, and ten points are awarded for riding Sebac though you don't know this till you load in the data for the second part of the adventure. Graham wants to know if he's the only one to have solved the second half of the adventure, which is very much more devious than the first, as he never sees questions or answers on that section printed anywhere. If you want to compare notes on that second part (or just get Graham in trouble with She-Who-Must-Be-Obeyed for playing adventures when he should be decorating the house) then write to Bath, Avon. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Richard Young</b> of London SE2 asks what use the marmalade sandwich is in <I><a href="theboggit.htm">The Boggit</a></I> - REDIPS EHT OT TI EVIG. And how to pass the crocodile pool in <I>Zzzzz</I>? Be a bold adventurer and ELIDOCORC NO DNATS! Richard is yet another arcade freak who decided to try adventures recently, and became engrossed in <I><a href="tolkientrilogy.htm">The Hobbit</a></I>. He's obviously not used to the laws of the adventure page yet, as he forgot to enclose an sae, so as a final point let me remind all of you what the rules are. If you want a quick answer to your problems (of the adventuring kind, that is) then you're guaranteed to get one if you enclose a stamped addressed envelope. No sae means I'll try to answer your questions in these sacred pages, but that means a wait of at least a month till the magazine appears, and maybe no answer at all if there's not enough room to deal with everyone, which frequently happens. Comprenez? Good.
