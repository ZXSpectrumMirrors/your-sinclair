<p> <font size=4><b> WAZZ, BOOZE AND BUDS</b></font><br> I have a tip for all +2 owners about saving data and stuff. Firstly nip down to your chemist and say, "Stout yeoman, I would like to buy a bottle of polypropyl alcohol and some cotton buds". With these you can clean the tape heads. When you save, save on a totally clean cassette - don't record over something, cos it probably won't work (it never does on mine anyway). 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, whatever happened to Dunc in December? Also you said that wazz is short for wazzock, but once you gave a way a poster which you said would "wazz up your wall". Why? <br> <b> Chris Delahunty <br> Thefiord, Norfolk <br> </b> <br><i> You want to be careful, where I come from you can get arrested for buying polypropyl alcohol - in fact, come to think of it they're pretty heavy about cotton buds as well. What do you mean, what happened to Dunc in December? The same sort of things that happened to him in October and November, I presume, although I try not to pry. And finally, while wazz is short for wazzock, it's also short for wazzy (wazzy - groovy, cool, funky) Okay? <b>Ed</b>. </i> <p> <font size=4><b> ON THE AIR</b></font><br> Have you ever thought of publishing <i>Your Sinclair</i> in quality stereo FM? I'm sure it would sound much better - no crackles or hiss. This would make people change from inferior MW 'mono' mags to <i>YS</i>. Oh, and whoever decided to merge <i>Frontlines</i> and <i>Streetlife</i> into a mega four page section called <i>PSSSSSST</i> deserves to be heartily congratulated! Better still, give this mega person a mega pay rise, as the idea is great. <br> <b> Robert Wilkins <br> Carmarthen, Dyfed <br> </b> PS. In case you didn't quite get the message, I quite like the new section called <i>PSSSSSST</i>... <br> <br><i> Look out for next month's </i>YS<i> - it's in Cinemascope with octophonic Dolby sound. <b>Ed</b>. </i> <p> <font size=4><b> FRAMED</b></font><br> I don't think your hairstyle looks like a cauliflower at all (fawn fawn) but I do think that you're very nice indeed. So, how's about a signed photo just for the space behind my bed? I would gilt-frame it and it would be the most prized possession ever to grace the walls of my humble abode. No offence meant, but you must be getting pretty desperate to actually print a picture of David Frost of all people. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That said, your magazine is superior to all the others on the market. So superior in fact that all my copies are kept in a huge vault, guarded by my pet body-building carnivorous frog 'Zippo'. I would be most grateful if you would print this as I've never had a letter printed before (1,2,3, aaaaahhhhh). Oh, how about some POKEs on the free tape? <br> <b> Ronny Meikle <br> Galston, Ayrshire <br> </b> <br><i> Say hello to Zippo for me. <b>Ed</b>. </i> <p> <font size=4><b> TOILET FEVER</b></font><br> Sorry about this, but things are getting pretty desperate round here - I've completely run out of writing paper, and this bit of bog-roll was all I could find. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ahem. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now to get to the point. After millions of letters (and pounds spent on stamps) I still haven't had a letter printed. Is it because you're still working at how you can double the size of <i>YS</i> so you can squeeze all my stuff in? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever the answer, please reply to this one, even if it's a friendly note telling me to 'bog' off - I really won't mind. At least I won't be wasting vital pieces of loo-paper each day <br> <b> Rich P. <br> Westbury-on-Trym, Bristol <br> </b> PS Don't even think about where I'm sitting while writing this. <br> <br><i> What cheap and nasty bog-roll you use. <b>Ed</b>. </i> <p> <font size=4><b> SPOOK!</b></font><br> I received a letter from Castle Rathbone. Oh goody, I thought, my spanky new <i>YS</i> badge has arrived. Imagine my surprise when I opened the letter to find nothing at all. <br> <b> Andrew McLean <br> Leighton Buzzard, Beds <br> </b> <br><i> Nothing? Nothing? You realise you allowed your gift to escape, don't you. We kindly send you eight cubic centimetres of treasured oxygen from the </i>YS<i> office and what do you do? You waft it into the atmosphere. There's gratitude for you. <b>Ed</b>. </i> <p> <font size=4><b> TO THE POINT</b></font><br> Being a fairly newcomer to the world of Spectrums and your magazine, I'm not sure whether you answer technical hardware queries or not, but in the hope that you do, here's my question. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present I'm the proud owner of a Spectrum +3. Is it possible to load programs from an external cassette recorder? If that is so, is it possible to go a step further and transfer these cassette programs onto floppy disk? <br> <b> J. F. Tarry <br> Stevenage, Herts <br> </b> <br><i> Just this once, well done, yes and yes. <b>Ed</b>. </i> <p> <font size=4><b> FINISHED...</b></font><br> After three goes at <i>Joe Blade II</i> I had completed the game. To prove it, here's what the end screen looks like: 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>'Congratulations! You have performed very admirably in completing your clean-up of the city'.</i> 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do I get anything? <br> <b> Robert Burbridge <br> Leicester <br> </b> <br><i> No. <b>Ed</b>. </i> <p> <TABLE align=center BORDER BGCOLOR=white BACKGROUND=""><TR><TD> <FONT SIZE=6><B><U>STAR LETTER</U></b></font><br><font size=4><b> WRONG END OF THE PLANET</b></font><br> I am writing this letter as your average Kiwi bloke. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately this poor average Kiwi bloke has a sad story to tell. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over here it is just not possible to buy games for the Spectrum. I don't know of any shop which sells Spectrum software around here, so the only alternative is to send away overseas for games (which take three months to come back), or hire them from somewhere - but that costs heaps - and you don't get to keep them. And do you know how much it would cost to buy a game from the hire-company? I'll tell you. Eighty dollars. Eighty flippin' dollars for one game that would cost you pommies &pound;7.95. Is this fair? <i>(It seems quite fair. Ed)</i>. 'Course it's not fair, that's why I'm writing to you. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's a suggestion I would like to make concerning your supermega splendiferous mag: how about having special competitions for overseas readers, because by the time the mag gets over here the closing dates have been and gone? <br> <b> Richard Scaglione <br> Hawkes Bay, New <br> Zealand <br> </b> <br><i> How about getting a subscription, then? Oh, and you should be glad about the price of software out there, cos it means your Star Letter prize is worth 240 dollars!! <b>Ed</b>. </i> <p> </td></tr></table><p> <font size=4><b> TRANSFORMATION</b></font><br> In response to G. Derham's letter (ish 35) about his Speccy 'turning into a C64', I thought I would write in and tell you about the day my Speccy turned into ... a swimming pool! I was loading my copy of <i>Humpty Dumpty Meets The Fuzzy Wuzzies</i>, and half way thorough I wondered what would happen if I pressed every key except 'F', '1' and SPACE and then did an inverted quadruple somersault with full twisting pique, landing with my hands on SYMBOL SHIFT and '3'. Well, the top flipped up and slowly an olympic sized (50m) pool came out complete with swimmers and an inflatable monster to play on. A message then appeared on the screen (now seven feet below the surface of the water), reading '... and you thought G. Derham's was impressive!' 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I pressed a key and the pool slid back into the computer and the game continued loading. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weird, eh?? <br> <b> G. Currie <br> Failsworth, Manchester <br> </b> <br><i> Yes, I have to admit it, that's the weirdest one yet. Still, who knows what other Speccy owners have come across. <b>Ed</b>. </i> <p> <font size=4><b> SLIPPY IN THE HEAD</b></font><br> Hello Teacake, this is Jester Red Leader, I'm steering one-three-zero and am making angels eight. My props have just fallen off and I'm going to pancake. I would like to take this opportunity, before I crash and die, to say that there's nothing like a good flight sim along the lines of <i><a href="gunship.htm">Gunship</a></i> or <i><a href="projectstealthfighter.htm">Project Stealth Fighter</a></i>. You can stuff all your mindless shoot'em-ups up Rambo's rear passage. <br> <b> Flight Lieutenant Fanny <br> Oldblighty DFC RIP <br> Somewhere over Dover <br> and nearing the ground <br> fast. <br> </b> PS I'm really Chris the absurd from Bristol. <br> <br><i> Yes yes, of course you are. Um, nurse, get over here quickly <b>Ed</b>. </i> <p> <font size=4><b> SURELY SHOME MISHTAKE</b></font><br> Could you please send me details on how to buy <i><a href="saboteur.htm">Saboteur</a></i> (on page 94 of the October 1988 edition). It said it was &pound'1.99, so have you got any in stock? - I will buy a copy if I get a reply. <br> <b> Michael Gallagher <br> Co Silgo, Ireland <br> </b> <br><i> There are several ways of buying a copy of </i><a href="saboteur.htm">Saboteur</a><i>, but I, for one, would suggest the 'shop' method. This entails entering a computer shop (not a butcher's) and asking at the counter for the game. Should a copy be in stock, you will be asked to hand over some money which will be deposited in the 'till': you will then be handed a receipt, any 'change' due and finally a copy of </i><a href="saboteur.htm">Saboteur</a><i> itself.

Just look at this catalogue of mistakes, all taken from <i>YS</i> December '88. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) P6. You spelt Schwarzenegger without the 'C'. I'm sure Arnold won't like that. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) P20. In your rather scathing reply to Oscar Macia's letter, you say your Portuguese is ill. Maybe it is, but Argentinians speak Spanish(!) 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) P22. You say you have run a list of POKEs for 'every single game ever released'. How about <i><a href="skatecrazy.htm">Skate Crazy</a></i>? <i><a href="bmxsim.htm">BMX Simulator</a></i>? I could continue the list but I won't. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4) P77. Mike Gerard reviews <i><a href="thebeast.htm">The Beast</a></i>. He concludes that it is 'a thoroughly good adventure', but it got only 6. On page 80 he reviews <i><a href="onedarknight.htm">One Dark Night</a></i>, says there are better and cheaper games around and gives the impression of not being wildly enthusiastic. It got 8. Perhaps a case of putting the marks in the wrong places? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5) P85 You mention a section of <i>RobocopM</i> is rather like <i>Green Bert</i>. Do you possibly mean <i><a href="greenberet.htm">Green Beret</a></i>? <br> <b> P.W.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Dear Madam Pico 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recently bought a second hand Flymo, but was silly enough not to ask for the instruction booklet. Basic electrical and mechanical maintenance isn't a problem, but I'm tearing my hair out over the number of 'spacers' I need to fit when cutting damp or wet grass. With one spacer attached the blades don't seem to touch the grass at all, and I find the lawn is the same length after a 'mow' as it was before. However, with two spacers attached I find that the blades have a habit of 'grounding' and churning up the garden. I'm at my wits end - what can I do? <br><b>Concerned, Hull</b><br> <i>Yes, you do seem to be 'between the Devil and the dark blue sea', don't you. My advice would be to only mow the lawn in favourable (i.e. Dry) conditions. One spacer should be sufficient in this case, but I find two spacers do give that professional finish we all hanker after. Maybe the only way to solve the problem completely would be to hire a professional gardener witb his own lawnmower..</i> <p> </td></tr></table><p> <TABLE align=center BORDER BGCOLOR="#208020" BACKGROUND=""><TR><TD><center><font size=6><b>THE WONDERFUL WORLD OF SPECCY</b></font></center><p> Every month we invite readers of a cosmopolitan (and hatstand) nature to write to us from their oart of the world.

I don't think you've quite got the hang of what trainspotters are for, but we wouldn't want you to be devoured by Aliens, would we, so you can have one. <b>Ed</b>. </i> <p> <font size=4><b> DOUBLE DUTCH</b></font><br> Hello you funky human! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am so happy about the new Sinclair. It is great. But here are a few questions. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) Does Odin still exist? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) How many Sinclair computers are there? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many kisses to the Vixen girl, she has lovely hair, I love her. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Byeeeeee! <br> <b> A. Adema <br> Haarlem, Holland <br> </b> PS How many bades do I deserve? <br> <br><i> 1) Yes, and his son Thor works for us. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Hundreds of thousands at the very least 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PS You deserve loads of bades, but I'm only going to send you one. <b>Ed</b>. </font></td></tr></table> </i><p> <TABLE BORDER=0 ALIGN=center VALIGN=center><tr><td align=right> <TABLE BORDER=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 bgcolor="black" background=""><TR bgcolor="black" background=""><TD><font size=2 color=white><i><b>Doodlebugs</b></i></font></td></tr> <tr><td bgcolor="black" background=""><a href="http://wos.meulie.net/pub/sinclair/./magazines/YourSinclair/Issue38/Doodlebugs/YS38Doodlebugs01.jpg"><IMG SRC="../thumbs/YS38Doodlebugs01.jpg" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=231 ALT="Doodlebugs"></a> </td></tr></table> </td><td><TABLE BORDER=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 bgcolor="black" background=""><TR bgcolor="black" background=""><TD><font size=2 color=white><i><b>Next Month</b></i></font></td></tr> <tr><td bgcolor="black" background=""><a href="http://wos.meulie.net/pub/sinclair/./magazines/YourSinclair/Issue38/YS38NextMonth.jpg"><IMG SRC="../thumbs/YS38NextMonth.jpg" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=152 ALT="Next Month"></a> </td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <p>
