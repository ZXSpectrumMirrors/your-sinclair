<div>Ah, good old Sherlock. 
He hasn't featured in 
an adventure for... 
ooh, at least 3 
months! But to show there's 
life in the old 'tec yet, here's a 
very tasty adventure written 
by a name I don't know, Ian 
Eveleigh. Ian's to be 
congratulated on a very 
professional game. Apart from 
the lack of graphics, <I>The 
Lamberley Mystery</I> probably 
bears comparison with the old 
Melbourne House <I>Sherlock</I>. 
And that's not to denigrate 
that classic - it just shows how 
standards have improved in 
the last few years. One-time 
revolutionary features are now 
bog-standard. In fact there are 
so many features here that I 
decided to stick them together 
in a box, leaving me to get on 
with telling you the story. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's 1887 and the game 
begins, as per usual, with 
Holmes and Watson at home 
in Baker Street. The first 
location description's so 
lengthy it scrolls off the
screen, which is a bit of 
a nuisance as you
have to keep 
typing LOOK
to remind you 
what's in the 
room
(fireplace,
table, book
shelves and so
on). Before
long, though, 
your faithful 
pageboy enters
with a telegram. 
(Ah, the inevitable 
telegram!) This is 
from your little-known brother, 
Mycroft, who informs you that 
a friend of his called Dr 
Fordham will be calling in on 
you at 11.30. A quick glance at 
the clock shows that it's 11.06, 
giving just
enough time for
a good nose
round and a
quick tune on
the old violin.

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fordham
arrives and
tells you he's
bought a new 
house only to 
find the remains
of a dead woman
in the garden.
Hopkins of the Yard 
seems to be getting 
nowhere with his 
investigations, so Mycroft 
suggested Holmes 
might be the ideal 
man for the job. Yes 
indeed, we've all 
heard of Ideal Holmes. <I>(You're 
fired. Ed)</I> 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the game's just 
chocka with detail, it does 
have a few features that could 
have been improved, so 
making it easier for beginners. 
If you don't quiz Fordham fully 
while he's there, he'll scarper 
without giving you the all-important info about where he 
lives. That'll leave you with a 
street full of hansom cabs 
outside your front door, but no 
directions to give the chirpy 
cockney driver. So where will 
you go? Nowhere, that's where. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we're on the faults, 
another is the way it uses 
containers. You might open a 
drawer and find an object 
inside, or even just examine 
the hat stand in the hall to 
learn there's a coat on it. Try 
to GET COAT and you'll be 
told you can't see one. The new 
player might think there's a 
fault in the program, and not 
realise that you have to type 
GET COAT FROM HAT 
STAND to make it work. 
There's no credit to <I>PAWS</I> that 
I can see, but this is a sign 
that it's been used, with the 
hat stand designated as a 
container (so therefore what's 
in it isn't regarded by the 
program as being in the same 
location as the player). A bit 
naughty. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, there's a 
lot of good stuff that lifts 
<I>Lamberley</I> out of the ordinary. 
Plenty of other characters 
wander around, going about 
their business. Press the bell 
in Holmes's sitting room and 
the landlady Mrs Hudson pops 
in with a beef sandwich! And 
in the hall there's a stool 
where the pageboy sits waiting 
to open the door for visitors 
when 
he's got nothing else to do. 
There's a cash balance given, 
and this alters as you pay cab 
drivers, buy rail tickets and so 
on. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The game's in 3 parts, hence 
I suppose the slightly higher 
price, but unlike most 3-parters you don't 
automatically progress from 
one to 2 to 3. You can move to 
any part any time you like, 
and as often as you like, with 
instructions given when you 
save your game in order to 
load it into the next part. As 
far as I can see, you will need 
to come back to Part 1 at least 
once. With the problem-solving 
part of the game, however, it is 
more a case of slow logical 
progression while you discover 
what's happened and try to 
sort it all out. It'll have more 
appeal to the 
experienced player
because you'll need to 
come up with the
right questions to
ask the right people 
at the right time,
and those aren't 
always easy to figure
out (or get word 
perfect). <I>The
Lamberley Mystery</I> 
isn't a great game. But 
it's a pretty damn 
good one. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<center><h3>THE FEATURES</h3></center><br>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>The Lamberley Mystery</I> has got 
some innovatory features 
that you'd be more likely to 
find on a 16-bit game, which 
always makes an adventure more 
interesting to play. Type MENUS 
and across the top of the screen 
you get 4 genuine WIMP-type 
drop-down menus. Coo. First is 
BUFFER, which includes an 
OOPS command that allows you 
to take back the last move, and a 
choice between RAMSAVE and 
AUTOSAVE. The latter is a 
RAMSAVE that 
automatically happens 
every 10 moves, if you 
select it. Other menus 
are ACCESS for 
saving/loading 
commands, EXIT to get 
back to the game, and KEYS, 
which gives you what 16-bit 
people refer to as stored macro 
commands. This means you can 
put lengthy inputs onto a single 
keyboard key, in this case the 1 or 
2 keys. If there's a command you 
think you'll be using regularly, 
and that isn't one of the game's 
many abbreviations, just stick it 
on one of these keys so that every 
time you press the 1 key it types 
something like FOLLOW WATSON 
or HIT THE RED DRAGON WITH 
THE SWORD (or whatever).

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the top of the screen is a 
permanent status line, giving 
your score, the date, time 
and how much cash you've
got. Most of the regular 
commands can be typed in 
as one or 2 letters, eg X for
EXAMINE, L for LOOK, A for
AGAIN or T for TWO... sorry, T for TAKE.

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are occasions when you'll want time to pass more quickly, for example on train and cab rides. Here you can choose WAIT (WA or Z) for time to pass in one minute intervals, SLEEP (SL or C) for 15-minute intervals, or HOUR (HO or 0) for, yup, hourly intervals. B or BACK is a useful little command you don't often see, and this simply takes you back to the previous location. AGAIN repeats the last command, and FOLLOW (F) allows you to tag on to a character who's just left your location, provided you type it at once. For example, where does Mrs Hudson go after she's delivered the beef sandwich? Just F Mrs Hudson and you'll find out.

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doors open automatically, if you have the right key, and so do cab doors if you HAIL A CAB, PAY DRIVER and you automatically cough up the right fare (no tip). You can (indeed must) QUESTION people you meet, and you can SAY TO WATSON "READ THE TELEGRAM" and he might just do it. An example of the complexities lurking in the program is that you can also use a command like SAY TO WATSON "FIND DR FORDHAM" and it might just work. Then again, it might not, but what have you lost? Finally HELP gets you a lovely Holmesian response.
