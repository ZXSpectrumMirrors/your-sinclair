<p> <font size=4><b> ON THE RECORD</b></font><br> Northampton Home Computer Centre has offered a local and national computer hardware, software and repair service for many years on the most popular computers and with regard to repairs on the 48K Spectrum we quote as little as &pound;2.50 while you wait, &pound;10 for a keyboard fault and &pound;19.50 only if we suspect one or more ICs have blown, (normally due to interface damage) with a seven to 14-day turnaround. We could also give away "free software and things too!" if we charged our &pound;2.50 customers &pound;19.50. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr C Pougunas said "WHAT! I can get it done through the post in 24 hours" (and that without any inspection) - well, we know, don't we, that you'd be lucky to see your computer within 72 hours, if ever again. Mr P complains about the &pound;10 express charge. This service is aimed at the business user where downtime can spell disaster, the &pound;10 being paid to the engineer for overtime (is it really too much to ask, Mr P?). 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what did he do? Leave his computer with "a load of crooks" or have it repaired through the post in 24 hours? You'll never guess. We replaced the cpu soak tested for 48 hours and charged him &pound;19.95 and that was in April. Well Phil, we can't win them all but we'll keep trying. <br> <b> KP Lower <br> Northampton Home <br> Computer Centre, <br> Northampton <br> </b> <br><i> You may not win them all but you've certainly won Mr C Pougunas... <b>Ed</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> HAPPY CUSTOMER</b></font><br> I was very pleased to see my letter re computer repairs in the July issue, but after further dealings with the Home Computer Centre, I'd like to add a postscript. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About three weeks after the original repair was completed my Speccy went on the blink again. I rapidly departed to said shop to complain and was met by the nicest reaction possible. They politely pointed out that I was suffering from 'interface damage' and asked to see my receipt for the previous repair. I was unable to produce the receipt and insisted that my interface was okay. Anyway I rushed home, got my interface (joystick) and returned, whereupon they proved the interface <i>was</i> faulty and the damage was a result of its use, ie my own fault. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From my previous experience I would have expected to be told 'Tough' - another &pound;19.95 please and a two-week wait. But there was none of it. While I was getting my Interface they had repaired my Speccy and said that because they hadn't warned me of the dodgy interface they would only charge me cost price - &pound;5. I departed very happily as you can imagine. <br> <b> C Pougunas <br> Northampton <br> </b> <br><i> Well that says it all really! <b>Ed</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> SORRY SAGA</b></font><br> In October 1986 I bought one of your magazines and was very impressed with the content. Shortly after, I decided to upgrade my Spectrum by getting a Saga Elite keyboard, having seen the Saga advert in <i>YS</i>. With the order I enclosed a bank draft and allowed extra to cover return postage by air, and specifically asked for this as I wanted the keyboard before Christmas. In mid February, when I still had no reply, I wrote to Saga asking what the holdup was. It's now June and I have not had a reply even to that letter. Last week I attempted to ring Saga but after 15 minutes of trying I was told by the London operator that the number was no longer in use. They could give me no alternative number to try. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has Saga Systems gone bankrupt? The Bank of NZ here has informed me that the bank draft I sent was cashed in mid-November. How can I go about getting my money back? <br> <b> A L Storm <br> South Dunedin, New <br> Zealand <br> </b> <br><i> I'm afraid Saga Systems has gone bankrupt and is now in the hands of the liquidators. I agree it's very unfair when a customer has to suffer this way. The only thing I can suggest is to get in contact with Saga's liquidators, Latham Crossley and Davies, giving them details of your purchase. Hope you have some luck. Incidently two other companies, Empire Software and Specialist Computer Repairs have also gone bust so please do not send any more orders to them. <b>Ed</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> TESTY TESTY</b></font><br> Name: Philip Gargin

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question 1: Imagine you are feeling a bit down and could really do with an ego boost by seeing your name in print. You decide to write a typical letter to <i>Your Sinclair</i>. Marks are given for: 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Writing in a humorous style without ever actually being funny. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Complaining about something. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Pointing out how ugly/beautiful or how stupid/clever a member of the <i>YS</i> team is. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Using the word mega, adding at least one PS and signing yourself with a silly name. <br> <b> Philip Gargin <br> Romford, Essex <br> </b> PS The July cover was mega, and sums up the 'Up yours you scummy aliens' feeling of what playing games is all about. <br> <br><i> EXAM RESULTS

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Result: FAlL (with distinction!) <b>Ed</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> A DOG'S LIFE</b></font><br> I bet this is your first letter from a dog (woof). Anyway who is the prat with the name of Phil! Are you male, female, canine or just an excuse of a human who pulverises people's letters to bits? (Howl woof bark growl.) Speak up Phil, what are you? <br> <b> Rover <br> Winstanley, Wigan <br> </b> <br><i> Snuffle, squeal...oink, oink... snuffle... sniff, grunt, grunt! <b>Phil</b>. I think what Phil is trying to say is, 'I am not an accountant, I am a human being!' <b>Ed</b> </i> <p> <TABLE align=center BORDER BGCOLOR=white BACKGROUND=""><TR><TD> <FONT SIZE=6><B><U>STAR LETTER</U></b></font><br><font size=4><b> WELL SPOTTED</b></font><br> Please find enclosed the very first genuine photo of a trainspotter. Although of tender years, this specimen is already showing clearly all the traditional features of such beings - (from the top) tousled hair, NHS specs, furry blue cardigan with hood, army surplus rucksack, Star Wars sleeping bag, crumpled corduroy trousers and battered plimsolls. He also had a squeaky voice, but this can't be determined from the photo (obviously). 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that this material is useful to you in your campaign to convince the general public of the existence of the trainspotter phenomenon. <br> <b> Jeff Tupholme <br> Arnold, Notts <br> </b> <br><i> It's the crumply corduroy trousers that really give the game away - he's obviously in the advanced stages of trainspotting - poor chap. It's actually quite early in the season for these elusive weirdos to appear in this part of the country so you've actually been very lucky to get a glimpse. If anybody else out there has any photographic evidence of the existance of the Very-spotted trainspotter please write in and let us know. <b>Ed</b> </i> <p> </td></tr></table><p> <font size=4><b> HIDE AND SEEK</b></font><br> In the November issue of <i>YS</i> there was an article concerning <i><a href="3dgamemaker.htm">3D Game Maker</a></i> by CRL. I read this with interest and waited for its arrival in the shops. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is now the end of May <i>(Not any longer it isn't. Ed)</i> and I haven't seen any sign of this game at all. Would it be possible to inform me of the situation and if not could you tell me CRL's address so I can get in touch with them. <br> <b> Mark Eyre <br> Burscough, Lancs <br> </b> <br><i> It's true! </i><a href="3dgamemaker.htm">3D Game Maker</a><i> has indeed been unavoidably delayed, probably due to lemmings on the line at Surbiton. But seriously, CRL says it should be appearing very soon. But, then again that's what Firebird said about </i>Star Trek<i>. <b>Ed</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> ALPHABETTI SPAGHETTI</b></font><br> Recently I did a survey of the first letters of games reviewed in <i>YS</i>, 375 of them in all. This may sound very boring <i>(Yes. Ed)</i> but I uncovered a conspiracy of software houses in favour of the letters B and S, at the expense of the letter X. Only one program reviewed out of all 375 started with X: <i><a href="xcel.htm">Xcel</a></i>. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the results: A=19, B=37, C=23, D=26, E=8, F=20, G=21, H=11, I=7, J=4, K=7, L=4, M=25, N=7, O=4, P=18, Q=5, R=20, S=56, T=22, U=3, V=4, W=14, X=I, Y=4, Z=5. <br> <b> R Blackie <br> London SW1 <br> </b> <br><i> I can understand why eight out of ten software companies, who expressed a preference, should be biased towards the letter S, I'm very fond of it myself. But why, oh why, do they shun the letter Y? Come on software houses, let's have some games beginning with Y and even more starting with S. They've just got to be the best letters in the world. <b>Ed</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> PIMMS NO. 1</b></font><br> I have a problem. I've still got that old rubber keyboard computer called the Spectrum 48K. I want to get a new computer and I was almost certainly going to get the +2. That was until the July <i>YS</i> edition previewed the new computer to come - the +3. The +3 looks brilliant but it's &pound;100 more than the +2. So I now have the problem of which to buy - the +2 or the +3. Please, please, please could you give me some advice. I use my computer for playing games and nothing else. <br> <b> Daniel Pimm <br> Northwood, Middlesex <br> </b> <br><i> Well, the only major difference between the +2 and the +3 is that the +3 has a built-in disk drive. Since you only use your computer to play games you'd probably find the Speccy +2 adequate, though you obviously wouldn't be able to take advantage of any of the disk-based software that should soon be available. It's really a matter of what you can afford. <b>Ed</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> SIMON SAYS</b></font><br> I wish to enquire about the whereabouts of a copy of <i>Arcade Dream</i> by Generation 4 reviewed in the April 1986 <i>YS</i> issue. I desperately need a copy so please could you locate me one or at least a shop able to sell me a copy. <br> <b> Simon Hall <br> Harrow, Middlesex <br> </b> <br><i> Where on earth have you been for the last year and a bit? </i>Arcade Dream<i> was an April Fool. There is no company called Generation 4 and the only shop you're likely to get a copy is a joke shop. Sorry, but I think you've made yourself look a bit of a plonker. Then again, you do live in Harrow! <b>Ed</b> </i> <p> <TABLE align=center BORDER BGCOLOR=cyan BACKGROUND=""><TR><TD> <table align=left><tr><td align=center><IMG src="../thumbs/letters/trainspotter.jpg"><br><font size=5><B>TRAINSPOTTER<br>AWARD</b></font></td></tr></table><font size=4><b> FLIPPING 'ECK</b></font><br> I hereby claim a trainspotter award for spotting a mistake on the very first page of your marvelous mag.

It's me again! Don't worry, I'm not going to rave on about how much I love Martin Dixon. I've decided that since he doesn't work at <i>YS</i> any more I'm going to have to find somebody else in the mag to rave on about. So what I want you to do is print the pictures (or just one picture) of all the males at <i>YS</i> who want some fan mail. Then I'll pick the one who I think is the most handsome, and he'll be guaranteed fan mail for life! Oh come on lads! Don't tell me you don't want fan mail every month from an attractive young lady who tells you how much she loves you, and how handsome you are, and what a wonderful body you've got, and how every time she sees your picture she goes WILD with desire? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm so desperate to find a new idol. I would even consider Phil South. <br> <b> Claire Terry <br> Southampton, Hants <br> </b> <br><i> You must be desperate if you'll consider Phil 'Gis a sandwich' South.

I feel that it didn't give enough information on the machine, so here are some questions I would like answering. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Although you said the disk took 15-20 seconds to LOAD the demo games, what about SAVE, VERIFY etc? How about doing some speed trials like you did in <i>Your Spectrum</i> issues 14 and 16 for Microdrives, Wafadrives etc? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. What K storage do the disks have per side? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. What syntax do the disks use? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. How much are they? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Can Multiface transfer to the disk or is there an internal method? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. Although there is a tape/sound socket can it record and LOAD from tape? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. Is there any improved 48K software compatibility? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. What on earth is Peritel which shares the RGB output? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. How exactly is the COPY command improved? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. How do the standard and shaded screen dumps get activated? How good are they? <br> <b> Mark Weston <br> Melton Mowbray, Leics <br> </b> <br><i> In answer to your barrage of questions: 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The same. 2. 350K. 3. LOAD "device: filename" 4. Approx &pound;5. 5. No to both questions, but Romantic Robot won't hang about. 6. Yes. 7. Eh? 8. I suspect it's a kind of special Philips video standard. 9. COPY EXP gives you an expanded grey scale dump. 10. See above and dunno, in that order. <b>Technical Phil</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> AFFIDAVID</b></font><br> I am just writing a quick note to congratulate Victor Bell on his great Doodlebug cartoon featuring Magic Knight (July issue). The humour appealed to me and I imagine Magic Knight, if he were in total control of his own destiny, would be inclined to take the same attitude. (Unfortunately for MK I am in total control of his destiny and if it was as easy as the cartoon made it sound I would not be able to write a decent game and make a living!) 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yours in a multitude of interesting ways, <br> <b> David Jones <br> Enfield, Middlesex <br> </b> <br><i> <p><center><a href="../thumbs/letters/big/21c.jpg"><IMG SRC="../thumbs/letters/21c.jpg"></a></center><p> Glad you liked it. It's the 'Yours in a multitude of interesting ways' that I'd like to know more about. <b>Ed</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> WELL RED</b></font><br> Well done you clever boffins at <i>YS</i>, you've enticed yet another amazed disciple away from an Iron Curtain magazine. Yes, you've guessed, after picking the May issue of <i>YS</i> from the shelves, instead of my usual communistic <i>Soviet User</i>, which is rather tedious and boring, I have now defected and waken up to rejoin the rest of the free world. It was the free game though that swayed the swingometer truly in your favour. <i><a href="roadrace.htm">Road Race</a></i> was brill <i>(Not carp, dace or perch? Fishy Ed)</i>, just what the doctor ordered for my poor fatigued Speccy. But there was only one problem - it was a little on the easy side. My best go gave me 25th place. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't understand why Ocean didn't put it in the shops - it could've been a mega excellent budget title. I suppose they heard about <i>YS</i> from a reliable source (Thatcher, the Queen, God). <br> <b> Darren Mitchell <br> Northfleet, Kent <br> </b> <br><i> Well what do you expect from a magazine by appointment to HRH the Queen. Glad you liked the tape, keep reading and we may well put another one on. <b>Ed</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> MISSING THE BALLPOINT</b></font><br> I was going to write this letter to you in my old biro, but I thought this unfit for the Editor of such a mega publication. So I wrote it in my new biro. <br> <b> Ian "Quite a guy" <br> Wormwell <br> Keighley, W Yorks <br> </b> PS Sam (wahay!) Fox! Just had to get it in! <br> <br><i> Get what in? No, don't answer that.
