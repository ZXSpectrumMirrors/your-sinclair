<div>Continuing its policy of 
only publishing 
adventures with a 
touch of class, Zenohi 
Software has smartly 
signed up Linda Wright, author 
of <i><a href="jadestone.htm">The Jade Stone</a></i>, <i><a href="thebeast.htm">The Beast</a></i>, 
<i><a href="cloud99.htm">Cloud 99</a></i> and several other 
spiffing little numbers from 
Marlin Games and Incentive 
Software. Here's her latest one 
- or latest two, as <i>Agatha's
Folly</i> comes in two very 
different parts. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tale begins with you 
buying your dream country 
cottage, though let's hope it 
doesn't turn into a nightmare 
once you hear what happened 
to the previous owner, the 
mysterious Agatha. She's been 
missing for some time, 
presumed dead, and you'll hear 
all about her from some of the 
visitors who turn up on your 
first day in the cottage. Visitors 
like the grocery boy, who says 
Agatha was a weirdo, probably 
murdered, and he certainly 
wouldn't like to spend a night 
alone in Bluebell Cottage in 
case Agatha's ghost turns up. 
Yikes, as they say across the 
way in the <i>ZERO</i> offices. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least the delivery lad 
leaves you some groceries to 
keep you going while you clean 
up the cottage. This is the one 
the estate agent described as 
"in need of modernisation", 
which roughly translated into 
English means it's a mess! Due 
to the inevitable mix-up with 
the delivery firm, your furniture 
won't arrive 'til tomorrow -
this game definitely has the ring 
of truth about it! Still, some 
furniture was included with the 
cost of the cottage at its 
auction, so that's a start. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not that you can get started 
on cleaning up, with this 
constant stream of visitors. 
Here I am, I've just gone into 
the bathroom when a woman 
arrives at the front door, 
introducing herself as Mary 
Parker, the neighbour. Bet 
she's known as Nosey. She 
describes Agatha as queer, 
since she spent all her life 
building her folly in the garden 
but would never let anyone see 
it. Kept babbling on about men 
from outer space too. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little does Mary Parker 
know, but I've already 
unearthed some information 
about that. First in a hidden 
cupboard was a notepad, 
covered in child's handwriting. 
This tells of a man called Kaz, 
who claims to come from 
another world. Sounds like 
Krazy Kaz. The notes claim 
that he's funny (you can say 
that again). He's funny (oh, 
shut up). Kaz is a member of 
FIT and gave whoever wrote 
the note a parchment with some 
funny marks on it and a crystal, 
then he said he had to return 
soon and left the writer behind. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elsewhere, after a root in the 
boot of my car and a bit of spit 
and polish, I found a journal, 
which read - <i>Now mother is 
dead I'm free to leave... Tried at 
Stonehenge but they stopped me... 
Tried at Avebury but it didn't 
work... I think some stones are 
missing... Have decided to build 
my own circle. . . It's finished - not 
for the crystal... It's in place. 
Adventure, here I come!</i> 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right, I'm just trying to get 
into the cellar when there's the 
sound of a car on the gravel. 
Another flaming visitor! I 
mutter my way back to the 
front door and think, Oh no, it's 
the estate agent. Who wants to 
see one of those at this time of 
night? Hang about, he's brought 
me a key which has 'CELLAR' 
written on it. How kind. Give it 
here. Now bog off. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back at the cellar door, this is 
just the job. It unlocks the 
door, I carefully press the 
switch on the outside before 
going in (they can't fool me, I 
know it must be the cellar light) 
creep down the steps and... 
rats, it's pitch black. So that's 
what the estate agent meant 
when he said he hoped I'd got 
the generator to work. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh well, let's find the 
generator. Haven't been in the 
back garden yet. First, I'll just 
examine these bushes. Ah-ha, 
a gatepost! Must remember 
that. Into the mill house and 
what do you know, one 
generator. Read the notice - 
ENSURE THAT WHEEL IS 
TURNING THEN PULL 
LEVER TO START 
GENERATOR. Fine, and here's 
another sign saying PULL TO 
START so I'll just pull this... 
hang about, how can I pull a 
hole in the ground where a lever 
ought to be? Botheration. 
Sudden thinks - the gatepost! 
Course, easy-peasy, just the 
job... so I toddle off to the 
garden and... the gatepost is 
embedded in concrete, 
impossible to remove. Rude 
words. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the kind of game in 
which you have to examine 
everything, and I do mean 
everything. It's written using 
<i>PAWS</i>, so lengthy inputs are 
possible and I recommend 
getting into the habit in each 
new location of reading every 
word of the text and entering a 
command like EXAMINE 
PLASTER, PAINT, STAIRS, 
GRIME AND RUG. In other 
words, examine everything 
that's mentioned, everywhere. 
And just because you've 
examined the wallpaper in 99%
of places and drawn a blank, 
don't assume you can stop 
doing it. She's sneaky like that 
is Linda Wright. Pay attention 
to the response messages too. 
In one place you'll read about a 
beamed alcove. Right, 
EXAMINE BEAMS AND 
ALCOVE. Every word counts. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The combination of Linda 
Wright as author and Zenobi as 
publisher has come up with a 
real winner in <i>Agatha's Folly</i>. I 
was playing it for hours and lost 
all track of the time -
definitely the sign of a good 
game. I also thought I was 
doing really well but discovered 
I'd still only scored 33/100. And 
that's only in Part One. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part Two's called <i>Marooned</i> 
and I only got a glimpse of that 
because I was told what the 
password was. I'll only give you 
a glimpse too, as I don't want to 
spoil the surprises, but here at 
the start you're asked if you 
have come from the folly, and 
then you notice a middle-aged 
woman who turns out to be 
Agatha herself. Where are you? 
I'll leave that to you to find out, 
but it's the start of quite a whole 
other adventure, believe me! 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two for the price of one -
you're the one who'll be 
committing the folly if you don't 
buy this one.
