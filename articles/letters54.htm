<b> Blimey, what's going on? Hang on a sec. (Sound of Matt going to check out what's happened.) Phew. Sorry about that. Um, seems we've just had a bit of land subsidance under the shed, and one of the walls has collapsed - taking Andy and his desk with it. He's lying under a pile of rubble at the bottom of the newly-formed cliff - suppose I'd better go and get help. Mind you, I should really be answering your letters. I know. I'll answer your letters then I'll go and get some help. Nothing like a bit of compromise, eh? (I'm so caring sometimes that it scares my jolly socks off!) </b> <p> <font size=4><b> PARCHMENT PROMISE</b></font><br> When searching through some cupboards I came upon a small piece of paper. It was an ancient parchment which said that <i></i>Your Sinclair<i></i> must pay me three full price games if I give them five pieces of advice and a poem. So here goes. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) Do not buy <i><a href="gazzasss.htm">Gazza's Super Soccer</a></i>. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Never call somebody with 18 sub-machine guns a Kiwi Fruit. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) Don't chuck your copy of <i><a href="strider.htm">Strider</a></i> down the waste disposal unit. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4) Never watch <i><a href="neighbours.htm">Neighbours</a></i>. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5) Send me 50 quid. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's the advice. Now the poem. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I like <i>Your Sinclair</i>, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I buy it quite a lot. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I start to read it 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It makes me feel quite hot. <br> <b> Lee 'How's yer father' Armstrong <br> Burnley, Lancs <br> </b> <br><i> I've got a little bit of a problem with advice number four. Never watch </i><a href="neighbours.htm">Neighbours</a><i>. Ahem - I do watch </i><a href="neighbours.htm">Neighbours</a><i>, and while I'll readily admit that it's totally crap I'll also admit that bits of it are brilliant. Joe Mangle for instance. He should have his own show! For anyone who doesn't watch it, here's a bit of Aussie slang (courtesy of Joe). "I'm going to tear the top off a couple of coldies. Ripped" A rough translation is "I'm going to drink two refrigerated cans of lager. Ole!" <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> BADGELESS & LONELY</b></font><br> It's not fair. All my pals have a <i>YS</i> badge and I'm the only one that hasn't. And they aren't speaking to me. I've sent a thousand letters, and not one has been published. <br> <b> Scott Brown <br> Dundee <br> </b> <br><i> Well this one has. Unfortunately Future Publishing has a policy of not sending badges to people whose names are anagrams of TWO SCORN BT. Terribly sorry, but I don't make the rules. It's all very weird down here in Bath. <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> FINDING FAULT</b></font><br> As part of my GCSE Communication course-work, I'm doing a project on home computers and especially on the ZX Spectrum - and how you go about mending one, as cheaply as possible, by carrying out your own repairs. Therefore I ask if you could please tell me what common faults occur on the machine. <br> <b> Kristian Palmer <br> Poole <br> Dorset <br> </b> <br><i> The commonest fault occurs when you accidentally nudge it with your elbow and it falls 15 feet out of your bedroom window onto an area of concrete patio - this 'fault' is commonly known as 'totally crapped'. Repairing a 'totally crapped' Spectrum is something of an art, however, and there just isn't space to tell you. You do need Blu-tac, though. Loads of the stuff. <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> NOT SO CLEVER</b></font><br> I have been buying <i>YS</i> since issue four and am sorry to say that the standard of reading material has dramatically decreased. Also, when entering compos, do you really have to write the full address given? For example, in the <i><a href="pictionary.htm">Pictionary</a></i> competition you had to put '<i>It Ain't What You Doodle It's The Way That You Doodle It</i> Compo'. I'd be embarrassed to send that in the post. Will the SAM Coupe work with my old black and white television (aeons old) and a standard tape recorder? Please print this as a Star Letter, or I might get mildly furious. <br> <b> Alan McGinley <br> Co Donegal, Ireland <br> </b> <br><i> Time for a quick lesson on 'How To Not Stand A Chance Of Winning The Star Letter Prize'... 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) Begin your letter thus: "I am sorry to say that the standard of </i>YS<i> has dramatically decreased." 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Ask a question that I've answered about 18 million times before. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) Have the same surname as my old Physics teacher (who gave me the slipper about eight times) and... 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4) Own a really old black and white TV set. Of course it'll work with the SAM, but what's the point if you can't see the squillion different colours? <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> IS PATER WELL?</b></font><br> Two of my friends dared me (two pounds each) to write in and say this -"Matthew Lindau loves Sarah Cleverly". My mates reckon that if Matthew sees this he'll duff me up, but I don't care. He wants to marry Sarah and give her a lot of 'how's yer father'. There, now I'll get four quid to buy more <i>YS</i>'s with (creep creep). Oh, and my sister-in-law thinks you're hunky and gorgeous. <br> <b> Ian Wakefield <br> Long Eaton, Notts <br> </b> PS My mum likes you as well. <br> <br><i> Eh? He only wants to marry her so he can keep on asking her how her father is? Why does he have to marry her for that? You can ask someone how their father is without 'tying the knot', you know. After all, imagine if, say, Luke Goss wanted to find out how Clare Rayner's dad was getting along. Following your rules, Clare would first of all have to divorce her husband before joining together in holy matrimony with Luke. Then, on the first night of their honeymoon, Luke would roll over to her (in bed) and whisper "How's your father?", to which she would reply "He's quite well, actually" or "He's dead" or something, and then they'd have to get divorced. What a palaver! <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> GOLDEN OLDIE</b></font><br> Reading your letters page, I see you don't get many letters from 40 year old fathers, but anyway here goes. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last Christmas I bought a Spectrum and admit that, after having tried to teach my son how to use it, I have become hooked myself. So, to try to improve my little knowledge, I bought a copy of <i>Your Sinclair</i>. But before I bore you further and you fall asleep, can you answer a couple of questions from a complete novice? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) The Sinclair SJS2 joystick that came in the pack appears to be total rubbish, being so slow and stiff. Can you advise me of another? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Are there any light games on the market to use with the lightgun? I can't find any. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's the lot, but, to conclude, have you or any of your staff ever considered doing, say, a one page article each month to teach the basics to completely 'green' people like myself who haven't had the benefit of learning computers at school and would like to learn as much as possible about computer programming? (At the moment I haven't got a clue how to type a written program in, or what POKE or Hex mean.) <br> <b> P Sarling <br> Chelmsford, Essex <br> </b> <br><i> Forty years old! Another 30 and you'll be hobbling around in a Zimmer frame mumbling to yourself about how nothing's made of wood anymore and dribbling all over the floor. I'd better answer your questions before your eyes stop working. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) Yes. It's crap, isn't it? Any other joystick you buy will be a thousand times better (not to put too fine a point on it). Check out the </i>Joystick Jamboree<i> feature in issue 46! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) You won't find all that many - the lightgun seems to be a little bit of a white elephant at the moment I'm afraid. Besides the original pack of six games that came with the gun (including </i><a href="operationwolf.htm">Op Wolf</a><i>), there's only a budget compilation tape of Codies things that I know of that'll work with your Phaser. Things should improve however - Virgin plans to bring out some new ones every couple of months. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, and as for simple BASIC tuition just you wait a month or two - I've got a 'surprise' for you (and thankfully it's not Cilla Black). <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <TABLE align=center BORDER BGCOLOR=white BACKGROUND=""><TR><TD> <FONT SIZE=6><B><U>STAR LETTER</U></b></font><br><font size=4><b> CRAWLING CAN WORK</b></font><br> I thought it was about time I wrote to congratulate you. I'm not crawling <i>(Yes you are. Ed)</i>. I just honestly think you deserve it, managing to produce a well-written, excellently presented, very entertaining mag (with hardly any spelling mistakes) every month. How do you do it? And your tapes are great too (although <i>Falcon Patrol 2</i> was a bit crap - whoops - there goes the Star Letter!) <i>(Not necessarily. Ed)</i> Well, you know what they always say, finish with a crappy poem, so here goes with a terminally vomit-inducing one... 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>YS</i> is really good 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's made of very thin wood 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's sometimes known as paper 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Oh, what a jolly caper). 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>YS</i> is just the best 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far sexier than a string vest 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope it lasts forever 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Haddock in a wooly 'cardi'. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Bit of poetic licence on that last line I'm afraid.) <br> <b> L Lustyear <br> Port Talbot, W Glamorgan <br> </b> <br><i> Now here's the formula for getting the Star Letter. Unfortunately it won't work again, and I'm not going to tell you what next month's formula is - so you'll have to guess (and keep your fingers crossed). I can be very fickle in these matters. (For instance that "Haddock in a wooly cardi" line almost blew this one. Far too surreal for the mood I'm in at the moment.) <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> </td></tr></table><p> <font size=4><b> GOLDEN EVEN OLDIER</b></font><br> I've just sent in a years' subs for <i>Your Sinclair</i>! Nothing unusual about that you may say. But there is. I happen to be in my mid-50s, and you only have to look in the Pen Pals section of <i>Input Output</i> to see that you cater for a much different age strata. I'd be interested to know if you have any more Methusalahs like me in your readership! Anyway, here's to a year with <i>YS</i> (that's how long I've been reading it). Please think of me sometimes when you plan the mag. <br> <b> Terry Filby <br> Beccles, Suffolk <br> </b> <br><i> I'm thinking of you right now, as it happens. Are you bald? Sorry, it's just that I'm really nosey. Oh, and to qualify as a 'Methusalah', you have to have lived for 973 years (I looked it up in the dictionary).

Anyway, whilst reading another computer magazine (don't worry, it wasn't C**** or S******* U***. <i>8000 Plus</i> actually) I happened to read an article written by your very own Mike Gerrard. It was about some adventure book he's writing. Tucked away in the corner of this article was a small paragraph that slightly worried me. It said that <i></i>Your Sinclair<i></i> was to move to Bath under a new publishing company called Future Publishing, who also publish <i>8000 Plus</i>. If this is true then will there be any great changes to the magazine? Will the magazine still have the same staff? Will it remain the same contents-wise? Please could you answer these questions as soon as possible before my brain blows up, messing up my nice white walls (padded for extra security, because I'm stark-raving-bonking-bananas mad). <br> <b> M Barrett <br> Pontypridd <br> Mid Glamorgan <br> </b> <br><i> Look, let's get something straight, shall we? You said "your very own Mike Gerrard". I have to tell you that he isn't mine. I can't stress this point strongly enough. I don't, and have never ever in my entire life, owned the bearded adventurer... I've never even borrowed him, to be quite frank with you. Honestly, the nerve of some people. Oh, and you might have noticed by now that </i>YS<i> is still as skill as ever. In fact, it's even skiller. It's now almost as brilliant as </i>Garden Sheds Fortnightly<i>! <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> EXAMINATION TIME</b></font><br> I am sitting my GCSE exams soon. Towards my exams I must complete various pieces of course-work. At the moment I am concentrating on my CDT Design Project. I must design a joystick and would like to know what your preferences are, and what sort of games it could be used for. For example... 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) Short response, steel shaft and microswitches = sports sims. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Microswitches, steel shaft and accessible fire buttons = arcade games. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That sort of thing. <br> <b> Arthur Banks <br> Hebburn <br> Tyne & Wear <br> </b> <br><i> No problem. Here goes... 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) Joysticks with autofire switches = games for which you have to fire loads and loads of bullets really quickly, in lots of different directions. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Joysticks that are shaped like keyboards and actually have working typewriter keys built into them - adventure games. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) Really cheap joysticks that are, despite their price, absolutely and totally brilliant = CodeMasters games. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4) Broken joysticks = games that won't load (ie for people with Spectrum +2As). 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How's that? If you need any help with your A-levels, don't hesitate to ask. <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <TABLE align=center BORDER BGCOLOR=cyan BACKGROUND=""><TR><TD> <table align=left><tr><td align=center><IMG src="../thumbs/letters/trainspotter.jpg"><br><font size=5><B>TRAINSPOTTER<br>AWARD</b></font></td></tr></table><font size=4><b> NOT SO KWIK</b></font><br> <i>Your Sinclair</i> is the best Spectrum magazine. Here in Portugal there are lots of Spanish and some English magazines, but you beat them all - even when you do some mistakes like the one I found in the December ish. In <i>Dr Berkmann's Clinic</i>, one of the games is called <i><a href="backtoskool.htm">Back To Skool</a></i>. Instead of <i>Back To School</i>! That's why I claim my Trainspotter Award. But don't worry, <i>Your Sinclair</i> is and will always be my favourite one. <br> <b> Aritur Jorge Morals <br> Portugal <br> </b> <br><i> Ho ho hoho! Thought you were being really clever, didn't you? Yes, you're right. In English the word 'school' is spelt, er, 'school' (with a 'ch'). The thing is that the game title is sort of a joke. '</i>Back To School<i>', only he still can't spell 'school' properly. Hence 'skool'. What I'm saying is that it's a deliberate mistake, and by trying to be too clever you've ended up looking a right clot! And I don't care if you are from Portugal - you still can't have a Trainspotter Award (just a badge). <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> WHINGE MOAN RANT</b></font><br> I've just noticed that after more than four years the train in the Trainspotter Award picture hasn't moved.

It's a British Rail train (ie stationary). The driver simply engages the motors after a two hour wait to make the passengers think "Aaah. We're off at last!" Then he turns the motor off and the train stops shuddering. Then he turns them on again. Then off. Then on. Then off. It can go on for hours. And in the case of the Trainspotter train it's gone on for over four years. Still, you can have a Trainspotter for giving me an excuse to slag off British Rail. Honestly, I know they've just got this new bloke in to sort things out, but it's not going to work. The whole thing's a shambles and all he's going to do is put the prices up and axe a few services.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for my own personal life, well, it's been in complete tatters! If you remember, last month I was sent a letter from the Monopolies Commission about my references to a certain well-known breakfast cereal. Surely other brands were just as efficient in household chores and handyman tasks, they asked. And of course they were right! Rice Krispies are no better, and no worse, than any other popular cereal (to within a five percent margin). 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what's been going on? I can only hang my head in shame. You see, my gran, Madame Pico, for whom I've been standing in since her strange disappearance a few months ago, was abducted during her two week holiday in Spain! Apparently, her kidnappers were henchmen of an unscrupulous advertising agency, Finn, Finn, Nesbitt, Finn (and Finn), currently bidding for the Kelloggs Rice Krispies account! Unless I made constant references to their prospective client's product they said I'd never see Gran again. Thus all my DIY suggestions! I knew the ruse was looking wobbly when I started receiving personal visits from a very suspicious Alf Slater of Slater's Puffy Rice fame. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, the reason I can tell you this now is because Gran's just been rescued by the SAS! Yes, she's due to be returned any day, just as soon as they've debriefed her on the whereabouts of the now missing FFNF (&F). I suppose she'll want her column back now. Ho hum. <br><b>Cheers, <br>Bud </b></i> </font></td></tr></table> <p> <TABLE BORDER=0 ALIGN=center VALIGN=center><tr><td align=right> <TABLE BORDER=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 bgcolor="black" background=""><TR bgcolor="black" background=""><TD><font size=2 color=white><i><b>Doodlebugs</b></i></font></td></tr> <tr><td bgcolor="black" background=""><a href="http://wos.meulie.net/pub/sinclair/./magazines/YourSinclair/Issue54/Doodlebugs/YS54Doodlebugs01.jpg"><IMG SRC="../thumbs/YS54Doodlebugs01.jpg" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=144 ALT="Doodlebugs"></a> </td></tr></table> </td><td><TABLE BORDER=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 bgcolor="black" background=""><TR bgcolor="black" background=""><TD><font size=2 color=white><i><b>Next Month</b></i></font></td></tr> <tr><td bgcolor="black" background=""><a href="http://wos.meulie.net/pub/sinclair/./magazines/YourSinclair/Issue54/YS54NextMonth.jpg"><IMG SRC="../thumbs/YS54NextMonth.jpg" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=143 ALT="Next Month"></a> </td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <p>
