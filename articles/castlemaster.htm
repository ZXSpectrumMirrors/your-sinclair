I've just been 
dropped in the catacombs 
again (a vast underground 
warren with oodles of ways in 
and, as far as I can tell, hardly any ways 
out)! I seem to be ending up down here 
with monotonous regularity. Fall down the 
well and you end up in the catacombs. 
Nose around the dark space at the back of 
the pulpit - straight to the catacombs! 
Drain the water at the bottom of the pool, 
investigate the entrance there and would 
you know it - cata-bloody-combs, here I 
come! Aaargh! (Do you get the feeling I'm 
getting a little frustrated here, readers?) </b>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm playing <I>Castle Master</I>, you see. Sort of 
against my better judgement actually. (I was going 
to get someone with a bit of patience like Jonathan 
Davies or Davey Wilson to have a go at it, but 
would you believe it comes in on disk? And how 
many <I>YS</I> reviewers have +3s? Not many, which is 
why muggins here is having a crack at it!) I 
suppose you want to know why I was so reluctant 
to have a go. Well, basically (and whisper it so no-one can hear) I was the teensiest little bit 
intimidated by it. Yep, I know every Incentive 
Freescape outing has been true Megagame 
material and everything, but when it comes down 
to it I've never actually played any of them. Not 
properly, anyway. (Oh, sure, I've marvelled at the 
graphics and spent a bit of time wandering around 
looking at things, but actually get involved in the 
gameplay? Nah, not me, mate. I don't understand 
it.) 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which is why I've got myself a couple of little 
helpers for this review. Over my right shoulder 
we have Rich Pelley, who's visiting ("...but not 
for long enough to write the review, oh no!") 
and who's had a go at all the Freescape games 
at one time or another. Then over my left 
shoulder it's my good friend Trenton from 
<I>Amstrad Action</I> (one of our new sister mags) 
who's reviewing the CPC version at a desk just 
around !he corner even as I speak. He keeps 
shouting "Have you got to the third floor yet?" 
or whatever all the time. (No, I blooming well 
haven't! Just because you're better than me...) 
Anyway, I'll bring my two little chums in 
more towards the end when we get to 
summing up time (though the way Rich keeps 
whispering the word 'Megagame' in my ear I fear 
it's a bit of a foregone conclusion). Ah well, on 
with the plot. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the other Freescape games it's a search-around-collecting-things, working-out-the-use-for-other-things, 
finding-secret-routes sort of game. 
Touchingly non-sexist, it features you as a prince 
(or princess - the first choice you have to make in 
the game) nosing around a spooky, seemingly 
deserted castle in search of your kidnapped twin. 
He (or she) is trapped in one of the towers by 
Magister, the Castle Master (hence the name), and 
guarded by a series of Guardian Spirits. It's your 
job to get him (or her) out! 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's a game strong on puzzles and high in 
atmosphere - if you should find yourself alone in 
the house, try turning the lights down low and 
then playing it. You'd scare yourself silly. I felt a 
few shivers pass up my spine, I can tell you, and I 
was in a packed office with my two little Spec-chums peering over my shoulder! 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But anyway, less of this messing about, let's 
start the game. A neat portcullis device pulls up 
from the front of the screen and - tarra! - a castle 
is revealed! A Freescape castle, to be exact, so 
let's walk around it and see what we can see, Bum 
de dum de dum. Right, it appears to be 
surrounded by a black moat (I thought it was the 
shadow cast by the walls until I fell into it and 
'Glug glug glug!' appeared in the message panel. 
Very droll.) At the back of it at one corner there's a 
shed (can't get in it though - no key) and what 
looks like a rock at another corner, but otherwise 
the plain is featureless. Time to go in the castle 
then, and there's only one way to do that - across 
the drawbridge. Hmm. The drawbridge is up. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A quick bit of faffing around (and reading the 
instruction notes) gave me a clue. Switch the 
centre screen cursor from Movement mode (where 
pushing forward moves you in the direction you've 
placed the cursor) to Throw mode. Place it over 
the suspicious-looking nobble high up on the 
castle wall and press fire. Bingo! Your character
lobs a stone at the building, and the drawbridge 
drops down. Time to go exploring! 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right, now we're in a courtyard. There are four 
towers at the four corners, some of which have
doors. As well as this though, there are a couple of 
extra entrances to various lean-to buildings 
actually built inside the courtyard. Let's have a scout around. Hmmmm
There's a well. Let's 
take a look (but not 
too close a look - we 
don't want to fall in 
and end up in the 
catacombs, do we?). 
Lean over it, use the 
Action key (which allows you to 
eat, drink, read, push, move, 
collect, examine, open, unlock or use as 
appropriate) and hurrah! I've collected a key, 
which must have been hidden somewhere in the 
well, though I never saw it. (Later keys, and other 
collectable objects like potions, are usually 
perfectly visible, however). 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That little success under my belt, I think it's time 
to actually venture inside the castle. Which 
doorway shall we choose? I know, this one! It 
seems to lead into a sort of spooky chapel. Hmm. 
Wonder what we can find in here? What about 
behind this pulpit? <I>(Don't do it! Reader's Voice)</I> 
Too late! I've tumbled into the catacombs! AGAIN! 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now this may not necessarily be a bad thing. 
The catacombs are basically long stretches of 
empty, featureless corridors, with plenty of turn-offs 
into other long featureless corridors and 
occasional doorways into... ah, but you guessed it. 
I've not found anything of interest down here, but 
that's not to say there aren't things lurking away in 
the corners, and I've only come across one way 
out so far, which I'm damned if I can find again. 
Basically I'm stuck down here, and very tempted to 
quit the game and start again. In fact, I think I will. 
(Quit.) 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right, here we are standing outside the castle 
again. Let's throw a rock at the button, open the 
doorbridge, walk into the courtyard, blah, blah, 
blab. Hmm? Wonder which entrance to take this 
time... 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so it goes. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The genius of these Incentive things seems to 
be to wind you up as much as possible, really get 
you hacked off with the whole business, then drop 
a little titbit your way - finding a key, unearthing a 
secret doorway, or running into another spooky 
spirit. These'll kill you if you let them, as well as 
make the room go a strange flashing red colour, 
but a well-aimed rock will normally settle their 
hash. If ever there was a fine balance between total 
addiction and total frustration this seems to be it. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only problem with this review so far <I>(What 
do you mean the </I>only<I> problem? Reader's voice)</I> is 
that it could apply to any Freescape game at all, 
more or less. In what ways is this one different? 
Well, let's consult my two little Freescape experts 
and see what they have to say. Excuse me for a 
second - talk amongst yourselves.) 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right, I'm back. Basically, we reckon the much-vaunted new Freescape+
system (seen here for the 
first time), which is meant to offer a 10% increase 
in game movement speed over normal Freescape 
(as well as draw things in smaller blocks, so 
they're more recognisable), is a significant 
improvement over the previous system. The game 
certainly runs faster than previous Freescape 
games. But it's also a lot slower. <I>(Eh? Reader's 
voice) </I>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain. It's not physically slower (like I 
said, it's quicker), but the game design seems 
tailored to a different pace of gameplay, something 
a bit more precise and thought-out. For instance, 
whereas in, say, <I><a href="totaleclipse.htm">Total Eclipse</a></I>, any key would open 
any door, here you need a specific key for each 
one, or so it seems. There seems to be a lot more 
searching around involved here, looking for the 
correct pieces then figuring out how to use them, 
though of course these first impressions could be 
deceiving, and the games always did seem to lean 
in that direction anyway. It's certainly not your 
rushing-around-shooting-everything sort of game. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we come to the conclusion. Those who are 
already familiar with the Freescape system are 
probably out queuing up to buy the thing even as 
we speak, so let's talk to those who are left (the 
unconverted) for a moment. Right, you lot. I really 
think you should consider buying this - unless 
you're a real die-hard action game freak. This is a 
game that stretches the capabilities of your 
Speccy to breaking point, is guaranteed to provide 
weeks of gameplay and has an incredibly 
professional, thought-out (and spooky) feel to it. 
Even the instructions and in-game puzzles 
devised by 'Europe's Funniest Man' (Mel Croucher) 
aren't too bad. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in all then, Incentive seems to have another 
winner (and another Megagame) on its hands. Yep,
just like Pelley kept telling me all along. (Smug git.)
