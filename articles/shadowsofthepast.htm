<div>When a company's 
been around for a 
while, like 
Compass 
Software has, churning out 
reliable adventures from 
<I>Project X</I> through <I>Demon 
From The Darkside</I> to 
<I><a href="intruderalert.htm">Intruder Alert</a></I>, it's easy to 
take them for granted and 
forget just how damn good 
their games are. I was a bit 
disappointed with <I><a href="hobblehunter.htm">The 
Hobble Hunter</a></I>, but that for 
me was a rare failure - and 
even that wasn't too bad! 
The company's right back on 
form now, however, with 
<I>Shadows Of The Past</I>, a 
game you're well advised to 
buy. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, you can get it even 
if you've got the earlier 
game that inspired it, 
<I>Demon From The Darkside</I>, 
as this new one is a total 
rewrite of that golden oldie, 
managing to make it even 
more golden in the process. 
The packaging's excellent, 
with a colourful cassette 
inlay and several pages of 
notes, an example other 
indies would do well to 
follow. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will need to read 
those notes too, as they 
contain some information 
you will definitely require if 
you're to get anywhere at all 
in the game. The story casts 
you as Morrack, the 
apprentice wizard, and your 
adversary is Drakon, the 
dread evil lord. You may 
have thought that you'd 
seen him off when you 
finished the <I>Demon</I> trilogy 
(which also included <I><a href="thegoldenmask.htm">The 
Golden Mask</a></I> and <I><a href="thedevilshand.htm">The 
Devil's Hand</a></I>), but through a 
time rip in space he evaded 
death and you're right back 
where you started from, 
except this time Drakon is 
forewarned and ten times 
nastier than he was the first 
time. Lawks-a-mussy! 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To give you a bit of a 
chance, you do have a 
magical staff (oh, all right 
then - oo-er), which can cast 
seven different spells, 
including LIFE (brings 
people back to life), LIGHT 
(guess what), FIRE, STORM 
and EARTHQUAKE. That 
is, you will have the staff if 
you make the
first few moves 
correctly, as it 
ain't in your 
possession when 
you begin. Each 
spell drains the 
staff of some of 
its power, and at 
the top of the 
screen is a status 
line showing 
STAFF POWER, 
which starts at 
251, DAYS (so 
much to do, so 
little time) and 
ZAP, which 
relates to certain 
spells that last 
for a while, like 
LIGHT, and 
enables you to 
check how long 
they've got left 
Also, ZAP must 
equal 0 in order 
to use any of these 
countdown spells. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right, are you still with 
me after all these 
complications? Good, though 
in fact it's much easier to 
play than try to explain. 
When you begin you're 
standing in the wasteland of 
Vral, with dozens of dead orc 
bodies all around you. In 
their midst, torn and bloody 
and barely able to move, is a 
small dwarf. A shadowy 
cave is the only exit, to the 
south. (Good, innit?) 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you explore the first 
few locations, anyone who's 
played <I>Demon</I> will feel like 
they're meeting a long-lost 
friend... the ruby, the statue, 
the walls that close in on 
you. But don't think your 
knowledge of the previous 
game will always help you! 
And not only are some of the 
problems different, the game 
has been well enhanced by 
programmer Jon Lemmon's 
latest discoveries about just 
what you can do with <I>PAWS</I>, 
and in particular its ability 
to incorporate external 
commands. We've got used 
to sound effects in his 
games, and there are plenty 
of those here, but some new 
and nifty visual effects have 
been added too. There's a 
great little routine that 
shakes the screen when you 
utter the magic word in the 
cave and cause the statue 
and cave to shake and move 
about. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing I like about this 
and other Compass Games 
is that it's easy to progress, 
although you don't always 
know whether you've done 
everything right and are in 
fact progressing in the right 
direction. There are very few 
barriers that frustrate you 
because you just can't figure 
out how to get past. When 
you do come up against 
what seems like a dead end, 
you know you need to go 
back and check you've done 
everything you could I 
had to do just that when I 
thought I was making 
terrific progress, only to 
have to restart the game 
and find an extra object in 
the very first location, which 
I'd swiftly departed from as 
some orcs were being 
decidedly orc-ward. It's the 
sign of a good adventure 
that when that happens you 
don't say "Damn, I've got to 
go back", but mutter "Well, 
the crafty little... 
programmer" instead. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't want to give too 
much of the game away as 
it's full of little delights and 
surprises, and the effects are 
certainly best discovered for 
yourself. It's got the usual 
handy <I>PAWS</I> commands, 
like GET ALL, RAMSAVE, 
graphics on or off, multiple 
inputs and so on. The piccies 
were a touch disappointing, 
apart from the usual 
atmospheric loading screen, 
and there was the odd 
mistake like examining the 
arrow or owl only to be told 
"It's just a (sic) arrow/owl". 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Normally I don't like it 
when people re-hash old 
ideas, it makes me suspect 
they can't come up with new 
ones, but just as we all got 
more enjoyment from Level 
9's earlier games when they 
bunged them onto their new 
adventure system, this 
Compass title is also well 
worth another look. And 
three cheers for the price 
being kept at the &pound;1.99 level 
which makes it a terrific 
bargain. In fact, I'll go even 
further - four cheers!
