<div>The Arthurian legends, like the 
Greek myths, have been the 
basis for many an adventure 
before, but never one as 
comprehensive as <I>Lancelot</I>. The 
story's split into three parts. The first two 
deal with Lancelot's arrival at King 
Arthur's court in Camelot, and his 
gradual elevation (you hope) into 
becoming the best knight in the world. 
The third part is the quest for the 
legendary Holy Grail, and you can go 
straight into this if you wish but you 
probably won't get too far if you haven't 
managed to turn Lancelot into the 
ultimate knight as it'll take all his wits, 
skill and experience if he's to cope with 
the quest. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what does it take to become a 
worthy knight? Chivalry, for one thing, 
and this is put to the test right at the 
start of the game when you encounter a 
Black Knight who challenges you. 
Cowardice is no part of the knight's 
character, so you must accept the 
challenge, but how you react if you win 
will have a great bearing on whether you 
progress or not. All your actions must be 
those which make you worthy to be a 
knight. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After your encounter with the Black 
Knight you head east towards Camelot 
and straightaway you realise that the 
research has been thorough and you're 
going to learn something about the 
reality of those days. No nonsense in the 
location descriptions like "You are in a 
field outside Camelot." "You are inside 
Camelot." As you approach you must ride 
first through the castle village, the 
community that grew up around the 
castle walls, and see the beggars and the 
way in which many of the really poor 
people lived. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's good to see Level 9 branching out a 
bit and working with teams of people 
rather than trying to do everything 
themselves. Even a family like the 
Austin's must have their limits! I'll draw a 
veil over the quality of the graphics, as 
only the +3 owners will see them and 
they'll wish they hadn't, but the text is 
mostly very well-written by Peter 
McBride and Christina Erakine. How 
about this, when Lancelot approaches the 
castle towards the end of the first day: 
"Dusk began to suck the colours from the 
greying world, leaving only the pools of 
light from the torches of Camelot." 
There's just the occasional word which 
jars, like 'tons' and 'micro'. Don't. Tell me 
either of those was around in Arthurian 
times! 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First task is to find somewhere to sleep 
for the night, and there are a few 
suggestions as to where you might try. 
You can use the GO TO command to go 
straight to any location, even though 
you've only just arrived in Camelot and 
should have no idea where it is. There are 
one or two hiccups in the responses as 
well. I wandered into the cathedral and 
thought it might be a good place to hole 
up for the night, so I typed SLEEP and 
duly laid me down to rest, only to be told 
almost at once that I was fired and had 
better find somewhere to sleep soon. You 
mean you woke me up just to tell me 
that?! 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The game has all the latest 
sophisticated commands, like GO TO/RUN TO/FIND a location or character, 
FOLLOW someone, get someone to 
follow you, RAM SAVE, WORDS/PICTURES, BRIEF/VERBOSE text, 
EXITS ON/OFF, WAIT and UNDO. This 
last can be used several times in 
succession, although it's missing on the 
48K versions. The complexities that 
these commands create haven't always 
been dealt with properly. If you use the 
RUN TO command you are taken straight 
to a place without the intervening 
location text being printed on the screen, 
but any random messages that you might 
have encountered on the way, do get 
printed up. So at one point I typed RUN 
TO MERLIN, and the first response I 
had was "Sir Kay made pretence to smell 
garlic" Erm, yes, quite. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You need to see King Arthur himself 
on your first morning in Camelot, and he 
knights you and introduces you to his 
Queen, Guinever. She seems to be 
fluttering her eyelashes at you quite a bit, 
but be careful not to have too many un-knightly thoughts. Chivalry at all times! 
You ask to be her champion but she says 
you're still a novice and must prove 
yourself first. She suggests you go to 
Logris and honour her with noble deeds 
and battles, and Arthur has a job for you 
too: free some captive knights that are 
held prisoner by rebel lords. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Playing <I>Lancelot</I> is, for a lot of the 
time, more like being involved in a book 
than a conventional adventure - which 
is one of the ways that I see adventures 
developing. Good to see Level 9 
experimenting in that direction. There 
aren't so many problems at first, and it's 
more a case of finding the main plot and 
sticking to it, although there are lots of 
diversions off to the sides if you wish. 
In one area you find a sick Sir Meliot, and 
he asks you to try to find a special cloth 
to help heal his wounds. Okay then, 
type FIND CLOTH and away you go. It's 
not quite as straightforward as that might 
sound though, as you have to work out 
how to get the cloth once you've been 
taken to it. But the early stages of the 
game do tend to progress in a fairly logical 
manner. Then it gets tougher, believe me! 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The area of the game is enormous, too. 
We all had a moan at the first part of 
<I>Knight Orc</I>, with its 100 or so locations all 
with virtually identical text, but here 
there seem to be even more places to 
visit, all well described, and with plenty 
of characters wandering in and out to add 
a realistic atmosphere to the game. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you wish, you can try to make a start 
on the third part, the quest for the Holy 
Grail, but it's best if you play your way 
through logically and try to build up the 
character of Lancelot first. You need your 
knightly virtues about you on this final 
quest, as after about five minutes of 
playing I'd already become a liar, a thief 
and a fornicator and had scored minus 
200 out of a thousand! 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is definitely a value for money 
game, to go back to again and again. 
Level 9's adventure systems been 
developing in leaps and bounds over the 
last year or so, but they haven't always 
had the stories to go with it. <I>Knight Orc</I> 
was a slight disappointment, <I><a href="gnomeranger.htm">Gnome 
Ranger</a></I> was much better and had the 
bonus of humour, and now with <I>Lancelot</I>
it's shown it can come up with a serious 
theme that makes full use of its skills - 
and which will test your skills to the full, 
as well. This good knight's definitely a 
good buy!
