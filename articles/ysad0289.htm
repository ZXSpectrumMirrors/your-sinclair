A trainspotter. Yes, that's right, I said Trmnspotter. I know it's not the Letters page, but this month I must claim a Trainspotter Award for spotting a slight blunder in the December issue. The two adventures reviewed, <I><a href="thebeast.htm">The Beast</a></I> and <I><a href="onedarknight.htm">One Dark Night</a></I>, got their marks mixed up - though this was obvious once you read the reviews. <I><a href="thebeast.htm">The Beast</a></I> should have got an overall 8/10, and <I><a href="onedarknight.htm">One Dark Night</a></I> slightly less at 6/10. So I claim my Trainspotter Award, and Jackie, the YS Production Editor gets a slapped wrist. <I>(Ouch. Jackie)</I> Oh, and apologies to Marlin Games who publish <I><a href="thebeast.htm">The Beast</a></I>. Now, down to business. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've had a letter from a very rich man this month. His name is A. Non, and he must be rich off the royalties of all those poems he's written. I didn't realise his first name was Arthur, but you learn something new every day. <b>Arthur Non</b> comes from Romford, and after asking me six trillion questions on adventure games he also asks if anyone out there can help him get a copy of <I>Sheerluck Holmes And Dr Witsend</I>? This is from a firm called Speccysoft, whose address I've lost, so if you're out there, lads, here's your chance to make another sale. Next, where can Arthur get hold of <I><a href="dodgygeezers.htm">Dodgy Geezers</a></I>, <I>Murder Off Miami</I>, <I>Vera Cruz</I> and <I><a href="sydneyaffair.htm">The Sidney Affair</a></I>? Why haven't we or other magazines reviewed <I>Not A Penny More, Not A Penny Less</I>? Probably because it's the worst adventure ever released. Whatever happened to the full release of <I>The Great Peepingham Train Robbery</I>? Good question - wish I knew the answer. I'm waiting for the author to let me know. Will Rainbird release a +2 version of <I><a href="corruption.htm">Corruption</a></I>? Nope, because it won't fit onto tape. Next. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Steve Harvey</b> of Cwmbran asks what to do in the cell in <I><a href="inspectorflukeit.htm">Inspector Flukeit</a></I>? DICA EHT PORD. What to do about the missing person at the monastery in <I>Terrormolinos</I>? YBSGRANS RM LLAC. And where are all the photos in the same game? Four at the beach, one at the island, one at the wine-taste, one at the bull-ring, one at the monastery, one at the disco and one in the Plaza. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Daniel Haigh</b> from Wigston Magna tried to be a Kind Soul back when the October issue appeared. Ian Jacobs of James Street in Lampeter was stuck in <I>A Journey One Spring</I>, and Daniel said when he read it he jumped up and shouted "I've got that game as well!" He says this was very embarrassing as he was in his maths class at the time. So during physics he wrote to Ian to answer his question, but the letter was returned by the post office saying there was no such address in Lampeter. I've checked my files and there was no misprint on the address, so if you're still out there Ian, and still lost, this is what Daniel says you have to do, in a forwards-writing direction: sit on the tree-stump, take the staff to the altar, climb it and touch the plaque with the staff. Then go down twice, along the passage and up. Get all and rub the orb. Go south till you can go no further then drink the potion - after that you're on your own. Daniel also asks if there's any chance of throttling the Ed so she puts an adventure on the cover. What, throttle our lovely Ed? I don't think that'll work. <I>(You could try bribery and corruption though! Ed)</I> <b>Ben Benson</b> of Okehampton asks several questions about <I><a href="rigelsrevenge.htm">Rigel's Revenge</a></I> and other games, 'cos he's tried out all sorts of things which turn out to be red herrings - a weakness of Smart Egg's. In <I>Rigel</I>, forget the factory gates and use REVIRDWERCS EHT to deal with the grille in the ventilation shaft. To cross the bridge, STNEMUCOD MORF DRAC DI ESU. In <I>Serfs Tale</I>, one of the red herrings is ROOD KAO SSARB EHT. To get past the troll, SEHCIWDNAS EHT ESU. To get the chain, SYEK EHT ESU. And at the troll's bridge, PORP EKAT. It may not be mentioned in the text, but take it anyway. To get some clues about the Hydra in <I>Labours Of Hercules</I>, type HELP twice at the Spring of Amymone. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Sue Medley</b> Prestel'd me a message about <I>Hammer Of Grimmold</I>, and says that an earlier tip of mine about killing the sleeping orc doesn't work on all copies of the game - the problem was changed when the game was converted from <I>Quill</I> to <I>PAW</I>, but what the alternative answer is Sue doesn't tell me. What she does tell me is that she agrees with my praise for River Software's adventures, "definitely among the best about". 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm in trouble again, this time over <I><a href="jinxter.htm">Jinxter</a></I>, as <b>Dennis Reily</b> of Northallerton points out. I said that to get the saddle to the railway station you could just post it. Dennis says if you do that then you lose the 2-Ferg coin. The easiest way is to KCAS NI ELDDAS TUP, that's the one dropped at the boathouse by Xam's mad gardener. Dennis also asks if he's alone in thinking <I><a href="jinxter.htm">Jinxter</a></I> overrated? I rated it quite highly as I thoroughly enjoyed it, but anyone's opinion might change if you had time to solve an adventure completely before writing the review. Unfortunately you don't have three months before you write your review, you're lucky if you get three days! Dennis says he finds <I><a href="jinxter.htm">Jinxter</a></I> very illogical in the way you have to deal with some of the more complex problems. Anyone else feel the same? Anyone found that their opinion of an adventure does change for either the worse or the better the further they get into it? And what do you think about reviews anyway? Sometimes people disagree with me (like <I>Rigel</I> should have been a mega-game, not 'only' 8/10), but would you prefer more in-depth reviews that were maybe a month later, or do you want to read about the latest games as soon as I can get them into the mag? Let me know what you think. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>William Snowden</b> from Cheshire has also been <I><a href="jinxter.htm">Jinxter</a></I>ing about, and he had written to me to ask why he'd only scored 195 points right at the end. He now knows why - on the tracks after taking the ticket, when you're told 'It's touch and go now... ', if you NIART RETFA NUR and then NIART OT PMUJ, you don't get any points, but if you NIART RETFA NUR twice then you do. William says he's also recently discovered a new way of losing luck, NEVO NI TEG at the bakery. (Only just discovered that -- why, I could have told him that the first time I played!) 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Lee Jon Powis</b> from Bournville is currently stuck trying to deal with the sea monster in the second part of <I>Rigel</I>. To sort that out, RETSNOM TA ERALF ERIF. <b>Lillian Wonnacott</b> from Torquay sends me a letter that shows she knows what I like: lots of kisses on the bottom! Much better than lots of boring old questions. But one question Lillian has to ask is what are the inputs needed to get into the computer building in <I><a href="rebelplanet.htm">Rebel Planet</a></I>? She's worked out that it must be 010, but the computer rejects this and you only have three attempts. In fact the digits to enter are (not backwards this time) 101-010-101. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ruth Golding</b> is having a terrific time in <I>Bard's Tale</I>, despite being stuck, and wonders if any fellow 'sufferers' can help with the following: what's the correct answer to the Magic Mouth in Kylearan's Tower (N2 E12); where is the Spectre Snare; and how to input the answer to the Magic Mouth on level three of Margar's (N4 E 10)? Ruth's worked out that it must be LIE WITH PASSION AND BE FOREVER DAMNED (and she's right according to my information!), but the game only seems to accept the first three words and won't accept the rest. Anyone else found the same problem? And more importantly, how to overcome it? I'm also grateful to Ruth for pointing out the main problem people have been having with <I>Blizzard Pass</I>, where the official clue sheet is misleading about trying to cross the fissure a second time. You have to cross a different fissure, where you won't be told to 'Be more specific' or that the rope 'Doesn't catch on anything' To get to the second fissure, though, you must GNIR NRUT before pulling it out of the wall. Needless to say the unofficial YS clue sheet, otherwise known as a freebie, has got the right info in it. (Who said "Makes a change"???)
