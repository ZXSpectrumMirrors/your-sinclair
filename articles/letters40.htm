The final message reads, 'Nice shooting, Murphy. You have rescued the president. However, crime does not stop there!' or' words to that effect. I can't remember properly, as my mum has <i>EastEnders</i> blaring in my earhole, and I am currently nursing the holes that the dentist just created in my poor, suffering gob, which has just recovered from the seven, yes seven, injections I endured earlier today. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But enough about me, and onto the subject of Spectrum magazines. Here are my top three. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1)	<i>Your Sinclair</i> 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Pass 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) Pass <br> <b> Gareth Long <br> Linton, Cambs <br> </b> <br><i> Seven injections for three holes? - thats two and a third per pearly! I think your tooth-doctor must have learnt his trade at the Marquis de Sade school of dentistry. Three free games should help you to convalesce I think <b>Ed</b>. </i> <p> </td></tr></table><p> <font size=4><b> BROTHER BOTHER</b></font><br> I am proud to say that I have decided to buy your magazine. I looked carefully through the other known Spectrum mags and have these comments. The first was poorly presented with little colour, and the info on some of their reviews was, to say the least, questionable. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second mag was slightly better, but it had the one thing that really makes you want to stick your head in a blender: it was BORING. They went on and on in the reviews to the extent that it took me three and half weeks to finish it. Just too much. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have, however, one teeny weeny critical remark about <i>YS</i>. It's so good that my brothers run off with it and then I can't find it. <br> <b> C.S.S. <br> Dunfermline, Fife <br> </b> <br><i> Here's a very simple solution to your 'sibling' problem: make a small hole through the mag (next to the staples) with a paper punch, and tie your copy of </i>YS<i> to your little finger (or something) with an extremely long piece of string. You'll now be able to find it wherever it may wander, so there's absolutely no cause for complaint. <b>Ed</b>. </i> <p> <font size=4><b> ONE HUNDRED AND, ER, TWENTY EIGHT</b></font><br> I received a +3 from 'Santa Claws' for Christmas, so I flicked through your mag to find <i>Program Pitstop</i>. I typed in the 128K programs for menus, and music and WOW! (I thought) this baby can do quite a bit. So I fiddled around with the program a bit and found how easy 128K Basic can be. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you to <i>Your Sinclair</i> for a lot of help. I will continue buying your magazine until the day the Atari ST gets dropped from &pound;399 to &pound;199 (which won't be for a while yet!) Oh, and the tapes are great, especially <i><a href="movie.htm">Movie</a></i> and <i>Dustin</i>, I see the price has risen, but who cares: <i>YS</i> is worth it. <br> <b> Nick and Ray (The <br> Visitors) <br> Dagenham, Essex <br> </b> PS Have you ever thought about taking up modelling? You have a great bone-structure (and the rest!) <br> <br><i> What's great bone-structure got to do with modelling? An Airfix Lockheed Tristar kit can be assembled by anyone, regardless of appearance. <b>Ed</b>. </i> <p> <font size=4><b> BOY FROM BRAZIL</b></font><br> I'm celebrating one year reading <i>YS</i>. I like <i>Rage Hard, Program Pitstop</i>, the cover tapes and some things in the <i>Tip Shop</i>. The reviews are very good, but a bit frustrating to me because I can't take all the games until a pirate brings them to me. This isn't a criticism of course, <i>YS</i> attends to the majority of its readers. I know you'll laugh after I say this but I own the despised Spectrum +3 <i>(Ha, ha. Ed)</i> but although I don't know any other people who own one here in Brazil. I like it. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+3 owners over the world you are not alone! I would like to hear from Spectrum user's, (+3 or not) from anywhere, Gosteriia tambem de conhecer usuarios do Spectrum nos parses de lingua portugesa. <br> <b> Ricardo Suzuki <br> Brazil, South America <br> </b> <br><i> You get given games by a pirate? Is he friendly? Has he got a parrot? And a wooden leg? All these questions and more. We may never know the answers And you shouldn't buy games from pirates either <b>Ed</b>. </i> <p> <font size=4><b> PERV</b></font><br> I think you're the most beautiful person in the world. I am desperately in love with you. Your photo is next to my heart 28 hours a day (if not more). To be frank, I NEED YOU. Send a life-sized, autographed photo of your heavenly self, so I can kiss it every second. Make my day, marry me. I love you. I adore you, so why cause me this agony - love me too. All I ask for is your love and a <i>YS</i> badge. <br> <b> Jitendar Caith <br> Plumstead, London <br> </b> <br><i> Unfortunately my love won't fit in an envelope, so you'll just have to make do with the badge. <b>Ed</b>. </i> <p> <font size=4><b> LOVESICK</b></font><br> Thank you for your letter concerning our <i>Lonely Hearts</i> advert. We have had a couple of replies, and have selected one. Sorry, but we do not really want to be featured in your forthcoming article - thanks for asking though. <br> <b> Oscar and Ewan <br> West Linton <br> </b> PS Please do not print this letter!! <br> <br><i> Whoops! Sorry, it just accidentally sort of 'dropped' in. <b>Ed</b>. </i><p> <TABLE border align=center bgcolor=black BACKGROUND=""><TR><TD> <center><font size=6 color="white"><b>KINDLY LEAVE THE STAGE</b></font></center> <font color="white"> We've got one good joke and one joke from Finland this month. See if you can guess which is which. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q. What weighs 14 pounds but didn't get plucked this Christmas? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. Roy Orbison's guitar. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q. What is the difference between a good and bad shepherd? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. A good shepherd puts his life for the sheep and a bad shepherd puts the sheep for his life. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you guess which was which? Thanks to Chris Delahunty from Norfolk and Janne Harju from Kalvia. We feel Janne's offering lost something in the translation. <p> </font></td></tr></table><p> <font size=4><b> MISTLETOE AND SUBS</b></font><br> Last month, as I took your mag down from the shelf and began to walk towards the counter, I noticed it felt thicker than usual (Oo-er) and I suspected that someone had slipped something in, so I clutched the mag tighter to stop this thing falling out (Oo-er again). Anyway, I payed for the mag and hurried home, and when I finally opened the mag in the safety of my own room I flung open the mag only to find fourteen(!) <i>YS</i> subscription slips. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I put one in each of the Christmas cards I sent that evening. For boosting <i>YS</i> subscriptions I demand a new shiny <i>YS</i> badge (please). <br> <b> Pete Ford <br> Worthfield, Birmingham <br> </b> <br><i> To make </i>YS<i> the thickest, bulgiest mag in the cosmiverse, I'm thinking of slipping in a free York Stone paving slab with future issues. Try mailing that to your chums. <b>Ed</b>. </i> <p> <font size=4><b> HOKEY POKEY</b></font><br> Could you please explain to me how I can insert POKEs into my ZX Spectrum without a Multiface? Also how much would a Multiface for my computer cost (and where would I get it?) <br> <b> Robert Brooks <br> Gateshead, Tyne &amp; Wear <br> </b> <br><i> If you're very careful you can unscrew the Speccy on the left hand side, prise it open with a sturdy kitchen knife and insert POKEs there (or you could type in the Basic listings from </i>Fab 'Wack' Macca's Practical POKEs<i> section). As regards Multifaces, you can get them from Romantic Robot, who advertise in this very mag. Get thumbing through now <b>Ed</b>. </i> <p> <font size=4><b> I LOVE EMMA LAZENBY!</b></font><br> Oi, if you don't print this I'll get those little Darlings at Code Masters to come round and tell you about their new game: <i>Beat The Ed Over The Head With A Concrete Truncheon Simulator</i>. Anyway, my mate bet me that I wouldn't send in a letter saying that I fancied this girl at our school. But I have and here it is: 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I LOVE EMMA LAZENBY!! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ha ha ha, he owes me a lot of dosh, but I'll settle for some wicked computer games, as this will undoubtedly be the Star Letter. <br> <b> James Sharman <br> Leeds <br> </b> <br><i> You should be so lucky (lucky lucky lucky). Using the Letters page as a dating agency, and expecting payment as well! Tch! The nerve of it all. Still, you can always give Emma your </i>YS<i> badge - they're far more effective than 'a last Rolo'. <b>Ed</b>. </i> <p> <TABLE align=center BORDER BGCOLOR=cyan BACKGROUND=""><TR><TD> <table align=left><tr><td align=center><IMG src="../thumbs/letters/trainspotter.jpg"><br><font size=5><B>TRAINSPOTTER<br>AWARD</b></font></td></tr></table><font size=4><b> TIME SLIP</b></font><br> While I was looking through my mega-brill January edition of <i>YS</i>, I noticed a mistake in the <i>Back Issues</i> page. On the coupon, instead of having 15 March 87, it had 15 March 57. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As time travel has not yet been invented send me a Trainspotter Award quick. <br> <b> Tim Meadows <br> Warminster, Wiltshire <br> </b> <br><i> Who says time travel hasn't been invented yet? If you speed something up to near light speed, its 'time' relative to your own goes all squiffy, resulting in travel into the future. To prove the point I've placed your Trainspotter Award in a particle accelerator - it'll be materialising on top of Nelson's Column (Ooo-er) in nine years time. <b>Ed</b>. </i> <p> <font size=4><b> 'ELLO 'ELLO 'ELLO</b></font><br> Excuse me, sir! I hereby arrest you under the 1964 Trade Descriptions act (made in 1964 you know sir!). Anything you say may be taken down and... 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's that sir? Why have you been arrested? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah well, in your issue 38 my Chief Superintendant was reading my issue and he noticed a slight mistake on your Subscription page, where your minions incorrectly stated that one would be guaranteed a meaty game worth &pound'9.95 FREE, if one subscribed. However, on closer inspection (once my chief super had cut my mag to shreds) he noticed that the games on offer were in fact worth &pound;8.95. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what have you got to say for yourself? I want a full apology printed in the Trainspotters section, and a prize. What's it to be, prison or a prize? Oh, very nice of you sir, and it's half past three by the way. <br> <b> PC Pascall of the yard <br> Halifax, W.

Byeee. <b>Ed</b>. </i> <p> <font size=4><b> IT'S A CERT</b></font><br> I always enjoy your film reviews, but please, please, get the certificates right. There I was rushing out to watch <i>Young Guns</i>, only to find the film was an 18 certificate rather than the 15 certificate that was published. Can I have a Trainspotter Award please? <br> <b> Alex 'Beady Eye' Worth <br> Hove, Sussex <br> </b> <br><i> Blimey, you're missing out in a big way - it's an absolutely brilliant film. Oh dear, that probably makes you feel even worse (tee hee). Okay, you can have a Trainspotter to keep you company for a year until it comes out on video. <b>Ed</b>. </i> <p> <font size=4><b> HOLY COW</b></font><br> I was re-reading <i>YS</i> ish 36 when I said to myself "holy cow", and all that stuff. You replied to a letter from Argentina saying that your Portugese was not good. Are you kidding? Don't you know that people speak Spanish there? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I deserve a Trainspotter award now. Send it to me. !Ya! <br> <b> Alejandro Pazos <br> La Coruna, Spain <br> </b> <br><i> Um. Er. Eeeeer. Uuuuum. Curses. Just for that you can't have a Trainspotter.

While leafing through my January mag (as I normally do), a picture on page 69 caught my eye. On closer examination I noticed that a maniac had been let loose with a one-inch chisel tip marker and had removed the good bits! Can you sack the person responsible and give away an uncensored A3 poster of them with the next ish?? <br> <b> Julian Marshall <br> Abingdon, Oxfordshire <br> </b> <br><i> Certainly not, but to make you feel better I'm going to send you a Kylie Minogue duvet-cover to put on your bed. Oh! I can't. Duncan's gone and nicked it - the scamp. <b>Ed</b>. </i> <p> <font size=4><b> CROWNING GLORY</b></font><br> I would want to ask you if there is a chance to pay your magazine by Czechoslovak crowns?)

You must be mistaking me for one of the girls at Maior Ronald Fergusons 'club'. <b>Ed</b>. </i> <p> <font size=4><b> WHO'S RIGHT?</b></font><br> After getting a Spectrum a few months ago, I thought I'd start buying a mag. So, before Christmas I bought two Speccy mags; <i>Your Sinclair</i> (of course!) and another one. I enioy playing football games, so I looked through both mags and saw they both had a review of <i><a href="royoftherovers.htm">Roy Of The Rovers</a></i>. You gave it seven and the other mag gave it 38%. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who's right? <br> <b> Richard Blair <br> Bunstable, Beds <br> </b> <br><i> We are of course <b>Ed</b>. </i> <p> <font size=4><b> WHATALOTOFLETTERS</b></font><br> Dear longwordspeople at <i>YS</i> - I completed your wordsearch in the Jan 89 ish in about two nano seconds, and then noticed something.

I am in love, I have a pretty girlfriend (called Antonia), but the problem is that I don't love her. The real girl that I love is a girl who I saw in a computer mag called <i>Your Sinclair</i>. She was in the cover of a great game: <i><a href="babarianii.htm">Barbarian II</a></i>. I think you are that girl, are you? I'd like to have your photography (if you are the girl, of course). I love you... I love you...

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also expect another badge for my letter printed in the November ish.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be patient" you'll probably say. Nope, I hate waiting! I am getting quite tired of you, T'zer! Calling Holland 'the land of the clog' huh? Have you ever heard a Dutch person saying something like: England - the land where they put acid on their french-fries? <br> <b> Martin Van Spanje <br> Vondelkade, Holland <br> </b> <br><i> Cor, you are in a bit of a huff, aren't you. Your </i>Psycho Pig<i> T-Shirt should have reached you at about the same time as we received this letter. And as for calling Holland 'the land of the clog' it was meant as a joke. I personally think that 'England the land where they put acid on their frenchfries' is hilarious. It's true, but not offensive (although I actually like soured cream on mine). I don't understand what you find so offensive about my reference to clogs. Holland is, after all, famous for its clogs. And windmills. And tulips. And Edam cheese, dykes and...

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Dear Madam Pico,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suffer from extremely bad sinus problems, and every time I kiss a girl she ends up covered in more phlegm than you could squeeze into a fridge-freezer.

I would suggest, short of going to see an ear/nose/throat specialist, that you invest in some kind of mask. Get your snot sorted out and the snogging will follow, as they say! </i> 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Dear Madam Pico,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have this uncontrollable urge which causes me to be the butt of everyone's jokes. The problem is that I want to be a mime-artist. Nothing appeals to me more than pretending to be trapped inside a house with invisible walls.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I awoke recently after a party to discover that my 'friends' had covered my chest, arms and legs with incredibly naff tattoos. I've come to terms with the fact that I will have to live with them for the rest of my life, but next Tuesday I'm meant to be going swimming with Bernadette, a girl who I've been desperately trying to date for months - and I know she hates tattoos. Also I can't swim. I'm at my wits end. What can you suggest? <br><b>Pedro 'anchors and roses'<br> Williams, Fife, </b><p> <i>The answer to both your problems is a tightfitting body-stocking in your own particular skin-colour. Fill the torso area of tbe stocking with polystyrene chips, and voila - a buoyant tattoo coverall. You may look a trifle lumpy, but you can blame that on 'a horse riding accident' or something. </i> </font></td></tr></table> <p> <TABLE BORDER=0 ALIGN=center VALIGN=center><tr><td align=right> <TABLE BORDER=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 bgcolor="black" background=""><TR bgcolor="black" background=""><TD><font size=2 color=white><i><b>Doodlebugs</b></i></font></td></tr> <tr><td bgcolor="black" background=""><a href="http://wos.meulie.net/pub/sinclair/./magazines/YourSinclair/Issue40/Doodlebugs/YS40Doodlebugs01.jpg"><IMG SRC="../thumbs/YS40Doodlebugs01.jpg" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=103 ALT="Doodlebugs"></a> </td></tr></table> </td><td><TABLE BORDER=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 bgcolor="black" background=""><TR bgcolor="black" background=""><TD><font size=2 color=white><i><b>Next Month</b></i></font></td></tr> <tr><td bgcolor="black" background=""><a href="http://wos.meulie.net/pub/sinclair/./magazines/YourSinclair/Issue40/YS40NextMonth.jpg"><IMG SRC="../thumbs/YS40NextMonth.jpg" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=424 ALT="Next Month"></a> </td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <p>
