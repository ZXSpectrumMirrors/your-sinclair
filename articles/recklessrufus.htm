<div><b>Reckless Rufus, eh? He's 
probably in a bit of trouble 
then. I mean, it's fairly 
obvious he's going to be 
trapped somewhere. If 
they'd called him Eminently Sensible 
Rufus, it would be a pretty safe bet to 
say that the game centres around his 
adventures in choosing the right pair 
of slippers, or making a nice cup of 
cocoa before going to bed at a 
reasonable hour with a good book. But 
they haven't. So I reckon he's going to 
be in a spot of bother. (Looks at 
instructions.) A-hall was right. </b>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Rufus fellow, it 
transpires, is stuck on an 
alien planet after foolishly 
hitching a ride with a 
disreputable deep space 
salvage company. Well, 
actually, 'hitching' is not 
quite the term. 'Sneaking into 
the cargo bay to avoid paying his fare cos he's 
a cheapskate' is, perhaps, more appropriate. 
Anyway, as crime does not pay etc etc, Rufus 
is caught by the crew the instant he tries to buy 
some liquorice from a deactivated robot. (It's a 
fundamental mistake that most stowaways 
make.) The Captain of the ship takes Rufus 
aside and explains, in a kindly, grizzled sort of 
way, that they'll happily take him on his way, 
provided he'll just beam down to a nearby and 
ever so not-dangerous-at-all planet and collect 
a few piffling rare crystals. Rufus agrees or, 
more accurately, falls for it. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hokay, so much for the plot. Onto the game 
itself, which (gasp!) is actually quite 
complicated. To help things, we've got one of 
those amazing annotated screenshots 
somewhere on the page. [Erm, to come in the distant future - NickH] (Looks up and over 
to the right a bit.) Ah, there it is. You play 
Rufus (the space-hoppery sort of thing) and on 
each screen you have to pick up all the 
diamonds (the diamondy sort of things) while 
avoiding the aliens (the alieny sort of things). 
<I>(Yes yes, we get 
the idea. Ed) </I>
This relatively 
lemon-squeezy
task 
is 
made all the more tricky by the platforms. Ho 
boy, the platforms. They're a bunch of 
scampish blocks and no mistake, my fine 
friend. No doubt you'll want to know why. Well, 
speak up. Yes, you, the one in the ghastly blue 
shirt. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b><I>So why's that then, Jon? G'wan, tell us.</I></b><br>
I'm glad you asked me that question. Although 
I wish you wouldn't be quite so loud, I've a 
frightful headache. Well, y'see, the problem is 
that you're about six miles above the surface 
of the planet, and consequently have to
watch your step as you totter around after the 
diamonds. Some levels have twisty layouts 
already, erm, laid out, but the majority have 
just a few blocks scattered around a queasily 
empty-looking screen. Find that annotated 
screenshot again. (Looks around.) [*cough* - NickH] Now where 
is it? <I>(It's behind youl Billy Bigshoes, famous 
1930s music hall 
comedian)</I> No it 
isn't. <I>(Yes it is! Billy)</I> No it isn't! 
<I>(Slap/Ed)</I> Oh, of course. It's up 
there. (Ahem.) Anyway, glance up at 
it and you'll see a couple of numbered 
blocks. These tell you how many extra blocks 
will be produced when you roll over 'em. Say, 
for example, you flop onto a number five block. 
Now you can venture off into empty space and 
as if by magic, a number four block will appear 
to save you from a plummetty doom. Another 
move, and bingo! A number three block 
appears. And so on down to zero, whereupon 
you plunge screaming into the ground. (So 
make sure you've reached another platform by 
then.) Get the idea? Splendissimo. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's about it for the early levels. Later on 
you'll come across such things as sticky 
blocks, Rufus-eating platforms and icons that 
reverse the joystick controls, but I don't want to 
frighten you so I won't mention them. It's 
blimmin' hard enough finding your way about 
the first couple of screens. <I>Rufus</I>, y'see, is one 
of those games where you'll get killed 
hundreds of times on a screen until you spot 
how to do it. Then the solution will lodge 
immovably in your mind burnt in by the 
humiliation of losing so many times before. <i>(Er, 
yes. Ed)</I> And before you wave your arms in the 
air and shout abuse in loud voices, there's a 
password system so you can skip the lower 
levels. Nyer! 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b><I>Well, it all sounds jolly exciting! (Sorry for shouting, by the way)</I></b><br>
That's all right, my headache's much better 
now. But yes, you're right - it is a pretty darn 
exciting game. The pace 
never lets up, as you 
waddle around the screen, 
trying to calculate exactly 
how far this particular 
magic block is going to get 
you while simultaneously 
fighting off a load of 
obstinate aliens. (Luckily 
you've got a laser gun. 
Hurrah! Unluckily, it's got 
extremely limited 
ammunition. Boo!) Then 
there are the one-way systems which have a 
habit of whisking you off in entirely the wrong 
direction. And the switches that need to be 
thrown in order to plug inconvenient gaps in 
the structure, and some other things. Yeesh. 
(As the famous Top Cat says). 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The game's presentation is so scrumptious 
you could bake it in a pie and serve it for 
dinner. The graphics are fat and characterful, 
ever so smooth and rather spankily-animated. 
(Rufus doesn't move from block to block, he 
sort of rolls around the place like a big beach 
ball.) There's some amazing 128K sound - the 
tunes are jolly, but the spot effects really are 
brilliant, especially the jaunty little riff you get 
when you manage to grab a diamond. Makes 
all the trouble worthwhile (sort of). 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The massively important bit is, of course, 
the gameplay. And where addictive playability 
is concerned, <I>Rufus</I> delivers in a big green van 
with an imposing company logo on the side. 
The combination of puzzle and shoot-'em-up 
action really hits the spot. There are problems 
(natch) - biggest of all is
the random movement of 
the aliens. Second biggest 
prob is the fact 
that zapping an 
alien causes 
another one to 
reappear across the screen almost 
immediately. Oh well. At least it 
keeps you on your toes, I s'pose. 
Hello - that naughty old summing-up 
paragraph has crept up on me 
unawares. Well, (cough, adjust bow 
tie) <I>Reckless Rufus</I> is a fine fun 
puzzle game with enough originality,
action and tension to keep your heart 
a-thumping for quite a while. <I>(So 
does that mean that when you've 
completed the game your heart stops 
altogether then? Ed)</I> No, of course 
not. Don't be silly. (Editors, eh?)
