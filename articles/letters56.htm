<b> Yo! Spec-chums! It's me again, Gadgy with the big ears - er, I mean Big Bad Matt, your leader and mentor! I don't know whether to be in a good mood or a bad mood this month actually. He hum. (Loud bang.) Ha ha ha ha! Andy's fallen off his chair and cracked his head on the Speccy bench. I think that spells 'good mood', don't you? Let's go then... </b> <p> <font size=4><b> HARD SELL</b></font><br> There have been some pretty shoddy sales tactics, but none so bad as that for the <i>Football Manager World Cup</i> game. Some sales berk at Addictive Software obviously said "How do I get this game to sell? I know - I'll release an ad including its writer's picture and a quotation from him!" However, this was a very foolish idea as the writer was none other than Kevin Toms, the ugliest man alive. He's enough to put anyone off buying it. What's so big about him anyway? He just looks like a tramp or something. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they go on to print a load of bull about how he went around to a load of club managers to make the game perfect. But worst of all, this ad was printed in <i>YS</i>! So 'Mr Ed', if I ever see this ad in the mag again Ill send you a big picture of Kevin Toms. And, yes, my name is spelt with an 'F'. <br> <b> Trefor Moss <br> Heighington, Co Durham <br> </b> <br><i> Yes, he is quite ugly, isn't he? But we mustn't be too hard on him - that is his passport photo after all. (Mind you, you should've seen the other three - one was of the top of his bonce, one was of him reaching forward to press the coin return button, and in the third some old bag was sticking her head into the cubicle asking him if he had two 50 peas for a pound coin.) <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> GREAT BRITAIN?</b></font><br> Firstly I must mention how brill <i>YS</i> is and how witty and intelligent the Ed is (he must be - printing this letter). <i>(Don't flatter yourself. Ed)</i> Secondly I disagree with you over Great Britain losing its Greatness as you stated in <i><a href="ultimatethecollectedworks.htm">Pssst</a></i> in issue 53, because... 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) Great Britain has got the best mag in the world - <i>YS</i> (of course). 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) We helped win World War I and II. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) We are a nation of intelligent dudes. <br> <b> David Possee <br> Thornhill, Dumfriesshire <br> </b> <br><i> Explain these then... 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) Simon Bates 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Little And Large 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) Margaret Thatcher. <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> SMILEY</b></font><br> I was reading <i>YS</i> 54 and I noticed that in <i>Joystick Jugglers</i> all of the Jugglers were smiling except Rich 'Trousers' Pelley. I read in an encyclopedia that it takes 14 muscles to smile but 43 to frown. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, Rich looks as though he has just got out of bed. This makes sense, because as he uses up so much energy in frowning he obviously wears his muscles out faster than you or Davey, and therefore needs more sleep. I'll finish with a poem. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich does not 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smile a lot, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Davey or Matt - 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I really hate that! <br> <b> Chris Embery <br> Layland, Lancs <br> </b> <br><i> Come on now. Be fair. Like you said, it takes 14 muscles to smile and 43 to frown, and do you know what Rich was doing while that portrait was being drawn? His face exercises, that's what. He's got the strongest, most highly-trained face in the country and can bite through solid granite. And did I mention the control he has over his ears and eyebrows? No, thought not. <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> ALMOST HUMAN</b></font><br> I have recently bought a SAM Coupe. I read the instruction manual until the bit where it says "The SAM Coupe prefers similar working conditions to you". "Great!" I thought. So I made it a cup of tea and gave it a chocolate biscuit. Now it seems to be quite dead. Help - please tell me what I should do now! <br> <b> F Portlock <br> Wyken, Coventry <br> </b> <br><i> It's not dead, it's just having a siesta after the meal (after all, a chocolate biscuit might not seem much to you and me, but for a SAM Coupe it's a veritable banquet). What you should do next is wake it gently at about four o'clock, give it another cup of tea, let it watch </i>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles<i> and then tuck it into bed with a steaming hot mug of cocoa. <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> WHINGING AUSSIE</b></font><br> I am an Australian and have been reading your magazine for two years. I cannot subscribe directly because the importers will only allow me to order it through a newsagent. I like how the magazine has changed during this period of time. I think it is the best Speccy magazine, but I have a complaint. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Australia we get the magazine three months late and I am unable to enter the competitions, so I would like you to have a longer entry period for overseas readers. <br> <b> Rodney Hall <br> Davidson, New South Wales <br> </b> <br><i> You can subscribe directly through us, you know. And there'll be no worries about missing tapes either, because (are all you overseas, readers paying attention?) we're going to be making sure, within the next few months, that the cassettes stay on the mags - wherever they're sent (except Finland). (Only joking.) Oh, and regarding your gripes about the compos, here's one especially for you. Only you, Rodney Hall, can enter it. The closing date is Christmas Day 1992, so no worries there. The prize is two games. Here's the question - what's due to happen in </i>Neighhours<i> (at the moment Des is going to marry Jane and Nick's gone a bit 'aggro')? <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> AAAAAAAAHH!!!</b></font><br> At 10.00 am on Mothering Sunday my cat gave birth to five kittens. I have one worry though - will I have to register them for the Poll Tax? <p><center><a href="../thumbs/letters/big/56a.jpg"><IMG SRC="../thumbs/letters/56a.jpg"></a></center><p> <br> <b> Ray Richards <br> Gainsborough, Lincs <br> </b> <br><i> I'm afraid you will. <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> WRONG MONTH</b></font><br> I want to know why you bring out the mag every month and have the next month's name on the cover. For example, number 54 said June 1990 but it was out in May. Is it to do with the country you're in or are you just stupid? <br> <b> Christopher Black <br> Hartlepool, Cleveland <br> </b> <br><i> Actually, it's the 'sell by' date. If you eat an unrefrigerated copy of </i>YS<i> which says June, and it's actually July, then the chances are you'll come down with Mad Cat Disease, <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> WENDY</b></font><br> This is a simple letter containing the simple truth. Many moons ago (around-about 1982) a friend of mine got a ZX81 quickly followed by a Speccy 48K and we used to play on it all the time. Well, naturally, I wanted one of my own - but every time it got to Chrimble I changed my mind and opted for something else (fool). Anyway, last year I started getting the urge again (oo-er) and started moaning about how I never got one, so my lovely fiancee (hello, Wendy!) threw her catalogue at me and said "Well, shut up and flaming get one then!" And I did. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having nosed around the shops a lot I learned of wondrous things called 'Amigas' and 'STs' etc. I gasped at the graphics! I swooned at the sound! I perspired at the price. And I bought a Speccy +2A. <i>(Oh no. Ed)</i> And I'll tell you what - you won't see me changing it for one of those 16-bit jobbies. I don't care if the software is arcade-like. &pound;24.95 a time? Get lost. There isn't a game in existence that's worth that much. Now, I think long and hard before I part with my shekels, and the Speccy beats the pants off its competitors in my book. The price, range and now the improving standard of software gave me no choice. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Speccy's what I call value for money. Now, after a year of sheer fun, I just had to send this letter to somewhere appropriate, and having given the Spectrum mags the same trial as the machines (and <i>YS</i> the thumbs up), it seems I've done just that. Thanks, Wendy, and thank you, <i>YS</i>. <br> <b> P McGuigan <br> Stoke-on-Trent <br> Staffs <br> </b> PS And there's nowt wrong with monochrome either. It's very relaxing (ahem). <br> <br><i> Hello, Wendy. <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <TABLE align=center BORDER BGCOLOR=white BACKGROUND=""><TR><TD> <FONT SIZE=6><B><U>STAR LETTER</U></b></font><br><font size=4><b> BLAST!</b></font><br> Me and some friends have just started a fanzine called <i>Blast!</i> and we desperately need games to review. We couldn't afford any so we had to think of a solution. Ho hum. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laurie (self-made Editor) said we should threaten software companies. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David (self-made prat) said we should shoplift them from John Menzies. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twiggy (can't think of anything to write in brackets) said (quote) "Let's close our eyes and wish very hard and maybe the good fairy will come and wave her magic wand and..." (He didn't finish because Laurie threw a chair at him.) <i>("Him" Er, isn't Twiggy a girlie's name? Ed)</i> 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these ideas were rejected and all eyes fell on me. Oh dear. Then it hit me. We could earn them! I outlined my plan to the others - we could write to a Speccy mag with a wodge of tips or a witty, intelligent letter. Well, we were too thick to solve a game so we decided on the letter. All eyes fell on me (again) because I was the only one who could write! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So here it is - the original, witty, intelligent Star Letter-type letter. And for the final touch, here's a crap poem from Laurie (slightly edited). 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If <i>YS</i>, they give us games, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We'll really all be quids in... 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they don't, we'll come around, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And smash their %$&pound;%S&pound; heads in. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ahem. <br> <b> The Staff of Blast <br> Galashiels <br> Scotland <br> </b> <br><i> Believe it or not you've cracked it. The next chap's not so lucky though. <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> </td></tr></table><p> <font size=4><b> DAMN!</b></font><br> How can I set about making a fanzine? Getting publishers to send me software could be a bit tricky - they might think I'm just a shark trying to rip them off, and not a genuine fanzine editor at all. But I can't afford to buy all the games for review. Can you tell me how to gain the software houses' trust? <br> <b> Tom Haggle <br> Rotherharn, S Yorks <br> </b> <br><i> In Disney films you always gain people's trust by a) being tied up, b) wriggling out of your bonds and c) not running away (even though you could if you wanted to), so when the person who'd tied you up discovers you didn't go and 'tell the sheriff' (or whatever) he has no option but to trust you. Dilemma sorted. Get the software houses to tie you up, wriggle out of the rope but don't run. They'll give you heaps of games. <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> SOME POINTS</b></font><br> Thanks a lot for moving to Bath - you totally screwed up my plans for work experience. Anyway, onto some suggestions to improve your mag. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) <i>YS</i> is really funny, but your reviews are, erm, two-dimensional or something. Bring back the screen diagrams! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Get some better games on your Smash Tapes, like <i>Wonderboy</i> and <i>Zolyx</i>. How about the first <i><a href="batman.htm">Batman</a></i>? <i>(You don't want much, do you? Ed)</i> 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) More <i>National Rescue</i>!. Do you remember that <i><a href="psychopigsuxb.htm">Psycho Pigs UXB</a></i> cartoon? That was (and still is) hilarious. More of them. Your artist who does the compos is ace (he works on EMAP's <i>BIG!</i>, you know). More of him! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4) Improve your covers. They're crap. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5) Print this letter. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6) Don't print any more of Leigh Loveday's stuff. <br> <b> David Maher <br> Waltham Abbey, Essex <br> </b> PS Oh, and here's a rap poem thing... 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bub and Bob were in a shop 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doing this really neat bop 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said "Woh, guys, just what are ya doing? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They said they were "woo woo wooing" 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, man, that's real funny" 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, we ain't listening to Jive Bunny" 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What then?" I consequently asked 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why, it's <i>Xenon II - Megablast</i>!" <br> <br><i> "Here's a rap poem thing"? Surely you mean here's a </i>crap<i> poem thing. And what do you mean, the reviews are 'two-dimensional'? Of course they are. What do you want - a hologram or something? <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <TABLE align=center BORDER BGCOLOR="#208020" BACKGROUND=""><TR><TD><center><font size=6><b>THE WONDERFUL WORLD OF SPECCY</b></font></center><p> <b>Letters from afar. And this month's 'contestant' is from very afar - Bolivia to be exact. She sent a joke too (check out Kindly Leave The Stage).

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess those, you know! Ha! I am Bolivia, which is maybe your first? Maybe not. Ha! The porpose of to write is two things - Tip Cards.

Trying to cover up the fact that in the picture the Ferrari Testarossa is right-hand drive you said that it's being seen from the the rear-view mirror of a vehicle travelling in front of it (ish 44). 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it was pointed out to you in ish 53 that if the aforementioned Ferrari was just a reflection the number plate would be backwards, you fabricated some story about the cover being set in Ciskei where all number plates are made backwards so they can be read by people looking in their rear-view mirrors. That sounds pretty plausible, but if you examine the cover in question you will plainly see that the car is driving past the Eiffel Tower which is, in fact, in France. Not Ciskei. I've got you this time, so don't even try to get out of it. Trainspotter Award, please. <br> <b> Joseph Guffey <br> Co Offaly, Eire <br> </b> <br><i> Not so fast. We do at least two days' research on all our covers, and this one was no exception. As I said, it was set in Ciskei (where number plates are, by law, written backwards) but I didn't say where in Ciskei, did I? Well, now I'm going to tell you - the cover of issue 41 is set in Zwelitsha, the capital of Ciskei. Okay, so far so good. Now, you know this ridiculous practice of 'twinning' towns and cities in different countries (in the vain hope of bringing world peace and harmony)? Yes? Like Croydon is 'twinned' with Cordoba in southern Spain? Well, guess what city Zwelitsha is twinned with. Give up? Blackpool, that's where. And to celebrate, the inhabitants of Zwelitsha erected a three-quarter-size replica of the Blackpool Tower next to the British Embassy. So what you thought was the Eiffel Tower was in fact a three-quarter-sized model of Blackpool's tower. And don't say "But there are people on top of it going 'ooh la la', because 'ooh la la' are the first three words of the Ciskei national anthem. Jumped the gun a bit, didn't you? No Trainspotter. <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> THIS ISLAND EARTH</b></font><br> I claim a Trainspotter Award for noticing another one of your stupid mistakes in the May issue, on page 34. You showed people how to complete <i>Fantasy Island Dizzy</i>, but hasn't anyone told you it's not called <i>Fantasy Island Dizzy</i>, it's called <i><a href="ystop100_3.htm">Fantasy World Dizzy</a></i>? You also made the same mistake on page five of the April issue. I have got the game myself and know I am not wrong. <br> <b> Simon Hyslop <br> Carlisle, Cumbria <br> </b> <br><i> Ah-ha-haaaaa.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Dear Bud, <br>Like yourself, I have a loved one in hospital. It's my great Aunty Betty and she has just undergone a successful hip replacement operation. I've taken her the latest copy of <i>YS</i> to cheer her up and she has read it from cover to cover. I'd now like to take her something else, but I'm short on readies. Can I make anything myself? Please tell me How To Do It. <br><b>Nell Bothat <br>Basingstoke </b> <p><i>Well, Neil, the best thing we can start with is a card. No problem here - just pop down to your local supermarket and invest in a packet of Rice Krispies. Remove the inner sachet and cut out the front and back of the box. Stick these two pieces of card together face-to-face and fold them in half to from the 'card'. Now we'll need to decorate the front. My favourite way to do this is to snip out your favourite picture from an old magazine. Why not go further and make use of those spare Rice Krispies by sticking them around the picture? You could also stick glitter to the puffed rice to brighten up the hospital bed of the lowest patient! </i> <br><b>Cheers <br>Bud</b> <p>Dear Bud, <br>Last issue you asked your readers if they had any 'Fresh Fruit On Cereals' preferences. I would like to inform readers of my penchant for dried prunes on my muesli, but I was worried that you may not include it in your column since the fruit isn't fresh. <br><b>Yours worriedly <br>Roger E Race <br>Lytham St Annes </b> <p><i>Oh no, Roger, I wouldn't discriminate against dried fruit, since it is also a natural source of goodness (and prunes in particular are especially beneficial to the digestive system). Maybe I was in the wrong for not enquiring about readers' 'Fresh (Or Dried) Fruit On Cereals' preferences! </i> <br><b>Cheers <br>Bud </b> </font></td></tr></table> <p> <TABLE BORDER=0 ALIGN=center VALIGN=center><tr><td align=right> <TABLE BORDER=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 bgcolor="black" background=""><TR bgcolor="black" background=""><TD><font size=2 color=white><i><b>Doodlebugs</b></i></font></td></tr> <tr><td bgcolor="black" background=""><a href="http://wos.meulie.net/pub/sinclair/./magazines/YourSinclair/Issue56/Doodlebugs/YS56Doodlebugs01.jpg"><IMG SRC="../thumbs/YS56Doodlebugs01.jpg" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=173 ALT="Doodlebugs"></a> </td></tr></table> </td><td><TABLE BORDER=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 bgcolor="black" background=""><TR bgcolor="black" background=""><TD><font size=2 color=white><i><b>Next Month</b></i></font></td></tr> <tr><td bgcolor="black" background=""><a href="http://wos.meulie.net/pub/sinclair/./magazines/YourSinclair/Issue56/YS56NextMonth.jpg"><IMG SRC="../thumbs/YS56NextMonth.jpg" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=145 ALT="Next Month"></a> </td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <p>
