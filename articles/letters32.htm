<p> <font size=4><b> YET MORE HOVER BOVVER</b></font><br> <i>(Editor's note: Following the letter last month from Mr I J L Griffiths, alleging that Gardensoft's recent megagame release </i><a href="advancedlownmowersimulation.htm">Advanced Lawnmower Simulator</a><i> is, in fact, none other than his own game, </i>Qualcast Rota-Mo<i>, we have received this communication, addressed to Mr Griffiths, from Mr Adolf Bibble, senior partner of Wibble, Bibble & Boing, solicitors.) </i><br> <u><i>On behalf of Gardensoft Ltd</i></u><br> A computer-game scout working on behalf of our clients was approached earlier this year in The Broken Arms, an east end public house. After, and we quote, "greasing a few unsavoury palms," he became the possessor of an innovative lawn-mowing game. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later that month, after extensive gameplay testing, a team of five Gardensoft computer experts 'broke into' the program's Basic loader, and a change was made. More specifically, line 10 was changed from REM**(C) Gardensoft Ltd 1988**. Furthermore the border colour on the options screen was changed from magenta to cyan. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We trust these facts will convince you of the futility in any further course of action on your part. We also remind you that court proceedings are costly fellows and that a legal aid solicitor is no match for a knobbled judge and jury. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hope you catch our gist. <br> <b> Adolf Bibble <br> Wibble, Bibble & Boing, <br> Solicitors <br> </b> <br><i> We await Mr Griffith's reply with interest. <b>Ed</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> OOPS, SORRY!</b></font><br> I collect letters of apology. I've got two from Ocean, which I got after winning a competition, in the <i>Victor</i> comic no less (no relation). The competition was to win <i>High Noon</i> way back in 84 or 85. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first letter said we are sorry to tell you that <i>High Noon</i> is taking longer than expected to write, but here are <i>Gilligan's Gold</i> and <i><a href="50bestspeccygames94.htm">Daley Thompson's Decathlon</a></i> to be going on with. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second letter said <i>High Noon</i> has been scrapped so we've sent <i><a href="matchday-54.htm">Match Day</a></i>, and we hope you enjoy it (I did). 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've also got one from Marcus Berkmann apologising for the length of time it took before the free game I won for the July 87 Doodlebug reached me. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did another Doodlebug for the January 88 ish and still haven't received my free game. Do you think you could oblige with another letter of apology - I do so love them. <br> <b> Victor 'Spider' Bell <br> Clifton, York <br> </b> <br><i> No I blimmin' well can't. I don't know what came over Marcus to write such a letter - he won't be doing it again 'cos he's fired! <b>Ed</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> HAS HE WHAT?</b></font><br> In your May issue (page 18) in the 'Tape Troubles' bit of the <i><a href="blindpanic.htm">Blind Panic</a></i> piece, you mention an azimuth alignment program and a screwdriver. I know what a screwdriver is, but what is an azimuth alignment program? Please explain. <br> <b> K Rickard <br> Fowey, Cornwall <br> </b> <br><i> Ah, now yer asking. Azimuth is a tape recorder technical term for the alignment of the tape head. You can adjust the alignment to match that of the machine the game tape was mastered on, which makes it load better if you're having problems. To adjust azimuth you twiddle the tiny screw which sits in a little hole just above the PLAY key (By the way, the plate onto which the screw is fixed is only in place under the hole when the PLAY key is pressed.) An azimuth alignment program listens to the sound coming from your tape recorder and helps you to adjust the screw for better loading. <b>Phil</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> GRIMEY GRIPES</b></font><br> Your answer to Mrs N McHarg of Glasgow in <i>YS</i> of May 1988 shows clearly that you miss the whole point of her complaint (and that of other readers including myself). If the smut you print is only meant for older readers, it does not alter the fact that it is still filth! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem with you is that whatever is in you must come out in some way <i>(Eh? Ed)</i>. It is most unfortunate that you have to use the guise of a computer magazine for that purpose instead of some smutty magazine like the one you gave away recently for promotion. At least then people buy it for what they know is its filthy content; in a magazine about computing we neither expect filthy jokes and innuendoes nor do we want it. <br> <b> William Oost Lievense <br> Belfast <br> </b> <br><i> I have never said that what we print is smut and filth - I certainly wouldn't dream of printing anything vulgar or obscene. I'm afraid you've missed the point - the innuendos in the magazine are jokes, not a calculated attempt to corrupt the nation's youth. Only those readers of an age to understand will appreciate them: the very young just pass over it. Besides, I think you're being a touch naive if you think kids at school don't hear, see and say things much worse than the stuff we print. In this magazine you don't get what I consider to be 'filth' - I'm sorry if you don't agree. <b>Ed</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> SICK AS A PARROT'S DROPPING</b></font><br> While being dragged around the shops by my mum I persuaded her to buy a copy of <i>Your Sinclair</i>. But clever mum picked up May's edition of <i>Sinclair User</i> by mistake and I didn't notice until she had paid for it. So I thought I might as well give it a try and to my horror, on page 31 I saw 'The 1987 Readers' Poll Results', and under the section "Rip-Off Of The Year" <i>Your Sinclair</i> was fourth. Talk about the pot calling the kettle black. I wouldn't line the budgie's cage with <i>Sinclair User</i>, let alone suggest it was better than your mag. <br> <b> Steven Green <br> (no address enclosed) <br> </b> <br><i> Remember that they've now been pushed into third place by </i>YS<i> - these are desperate men... <b>Ed</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> SAY WHAT?</b></font><br> It is exactly 31 months since the world's greatest Spectrum magazine, <i>Your Spectrum</i>, was replaced by the world's worst one, <i>Your Sinclair</i>. No other magazine manages to avoid putting anything relevant or informative inside in quite the way you do. Once <i>Task Force</i> went, that was it. Where's all the old machine code utilities? Hardware projects? Book reviews? Articles? Letters that had something to say (and for that reason, I assume you won't print this one, just to prove my point)? <br> <b> C Benson <br> Hamilton, Lanarkshire <br> </b> <br><i> Read </i>Program Pitstop<i> recently?

I am returning it in protest of the low quality and totally unnecessary and distasteful female pictures. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see little connection between your choice of pictures and the business of computing. I have made my protest also to my local newsagent, who has now cancelled the order. A magazine with any serious credibility in the world of computers would not have to put pictures like these on the cover to sell. <br> <b> Joan Fitzpatrick (Mrs) <br> Warrenpoint, Co Down <br> </b> <br><i> Sorry Mrs Fitzpatrick, I see nothing distasteful about a clothed female body I outlined last month the reasons behind using the image - it's the one being used in the game. Still, I take your point but at the same time you must realise that we are primarily aiming at 15/16 year olds, not the very young. <b>Ed</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> GIRLS TALK</b></font><br> Is this a porno mag or a computer mag? Is it really necessary for your continued existence to print revealing women on your front cover? I refer of course to the late, great May issue of 1988. Do you realise that persons of the feminine gender do buy your mag? Maybe you don't take notice of the fact that some letters you receive are signed by a girl's name. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what if the bulk of your readers are male - you should try to satisfy as many of your consumers as possible. Is that not so? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please do not try to imitate <i>Playboy</i> etc - it doesn't suit your computer image. I am quite sure that most girls would die of embarrassment to be seen with the May issue. I certainly would. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This apart I enjoy your mag, especially your adventure section. Now that I've vented my spleen and am oil tuckered out I'll sign off with a 'Good luck' and a 'don't disappear into the gloom of time for at least a hundred years for you would be sorely missed'! <br> <b> Stephanie Hume <br> Dundee <br> </b> <br><i> Oops. Well what can I say? Maybe all the male readers are offended by the He-Man type figures that are often portrayed on the front covers of nearly all computer game mags. <b>Ed</b>. </i> <p> <font size=4><b> GUESS WHO?</b></font><br> I am writing on behalf of my mum and dad's son and my sister's brother. On the May edition, to my horror I saw a lady poser with the looks of an odious vapour. How can you possibly print such dribble? You must be madder than Mad Jack McMad the winner of last year's 'Mr Mad' competition <i>(Blackadder III)</i>. <br> <b> Ian Cullen <br> Guildford, Surrey <br> </b> <br><i> In other words you're writing on behalf of your aunt's nephew and your father's sister's son's cousin. What on earth does an odious vapour look like anyway? Are you sure you don't mean viper? <b>Ed</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> ACE FACE</b></font><br> May I take this opportunity to thank you for a brilliant front cover on the May 1988 mag. I know there will be mixed feelings about it, but I think it is ace. <br> <b> Julian Marshall <br> Abingdon, Oxon <br> </b> <br><i> At least somebody out there liked it! <b>Ed</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> FRUITY EH?</b></font><br> Cor, yeah, more, more, oops, sorry, I mean, you perverted little dirty mag. I went into the local newsagents, looked up at the shelf and saw two big melons staring at me. No it's not the fruit counter at Sainsbury's - <i>YS</i> has gone porno. Thank you! <br> <b> Andrew Randall (13) <br> Southampton, Hants <br> </b> <br><i> Porno! Ha! If you really want porno, this mate of mine... </i>(This bit's censored. <b>Ed</b>)<i> not to mention the garden implements, the optional leather thongs, a bunch of bananas and Glenn Hoddle. Now that's porno! <b>Phil</b> </i> <p> </font></td></tr></table><p> <font size=4><b> PRICKLY SUBJECT</b></font><br> What have you done? All I did was absent-mindedly scribble off a quick note to you, carelessly mentioning a certain 'Lisa'! So what? Well, in my school, there are many <i>YS</i> readers who know me, who spotted the letter (greatly cut!) in <i>Small Print</i> ish 30. They haven't left me alone with their puns about Lisa and hedgehogs - and it's terrible! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've found it necessary, therefore, to write again to say I cannot stand Lisa or hedgehogs! But there is a certain female sixth former... no, no! <br> <b> Rob Moorman <br> Plymouth, Devon <br> </b> <br><i> There is?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR><B>LEO </b><BR> (Jul 24-Aug 23 ) Work is looking up this month, so if you're doing exams you're almost certain to pass everything with flying colours and eventually be elected to the Regius Professorship of Modern History at Oxford University. Almost certain. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR><B>VIRGO</b><br> (Aug 24-Sep 23) Feeling paranoid? If not you should be, as masked men carrying chainsaws will be chasing you around town this month. Especially if you were chatting their girlfriends up the previous evening. My advice: stay in and watch Bob Monkhouse. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR><B>LIBRA </b><br> (Sep 24-Oct 23) Sorry, nothing happening to you this month. Hard life, isn't it? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR><B>SCORPIO </b><br> (Oct 24-Nov 22) A good month for travel, and many Scorpio businessmen will find themselves flying out to Spain for extended holidays beyond the reach of extradition treaties. For <i>YS</i> readers, it may be time to renew that bus pass. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR><B>SAGITTARIUS </b><br> (Nov 23-Dec 21 ) Footwear figures prominently in your horoscope, so why not pop out this moment and buy that pair of fluffy slippers you've been looking at? And don't forgct the Odor Eaters. </font></td></tr></table> <p> <TABLE BORDER=0 ALIGN=center VALIGN=center><tr><td align=right> <TABLE BORDER=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 bgcolor="black" background=""><TR bgcolor="black" background=""><TD><font size=2 color=white><i><b>Doodlebugs</b></i></font></td></tr> <tr><td bgcolor="black" background=""><a href="http://wos.meulie.net/pub/sinclair/./magazines/YourSinclair/Issue32/Doodlebugs/YS32Doodlebugs01.jpg"><IMG SRC="../thumbs/YS32Doodlebugs01.jpg" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=260 ALT="Doodlebugs"></a> </td></tr></table> </td><td></td></tr></table> <p>
