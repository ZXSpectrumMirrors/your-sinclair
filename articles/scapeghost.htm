<div>As we now know, <I>Scapeghost</I> is 
going to be the last of the 
traditional adventures from 
Level 9. Not even Ingrid 
Bottomlow will be making her 
promised third appearance, so it's boo-hoo 
and tears all round. Pete Austin says 
sales have been falling with each 
successive release, which seems mad as 
the games have been getting better all 
the time! No doubt piracy has played its 
part, and anyone who's ever pirated a 
game can now be glad that at last they've 
seen the consequences. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But down from the pulpit and into the 
graveyard, where the action in this one 
takes place. You didn't think there was 
much action in a graveyard? Obviously 
you've never spent a night in one, or in 
this case three nights, one for each part 
of the adventure - November 
Graveyard, Haunted House and 
Poltergeist. You have to survive each 
night in order to get through to the next 
part, but you can also play them 
independently if you like. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why are you in a graveyard? Well, 
you're about to be buried, that's why. 
Yes, you start this game as a stiff. You 
used to be a copper 'til you got involved 
in some drugs deal. You were betrayed to 
the drugs gang, and took the blame for 
your own death. Nasty stories abound, 
so you've got three nights in which to 
prove your innocence. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You'd do well to start this game several 
times before playing it for real. Each time 
you start use the FOLLOW command to 
latch on to different people attending 
your funeral. You'll hear and see some 
useful clues. One 'tec says "Well, that's 
one nosey snoop buried", so it sounds 
like there's more corruption here than in 
the West Midlands Fuzz force. You also 
learn something about the vault in the 
graveyard. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sooner or later the lights will go out, 
day becomes night, and the other ghosts 
on the graveyard shift start to put in an 
appearance. Your spirit guide will be Joe 
Danby, who's in the next grave to you. 
He used to be landlord of the Pig And 
Whistle. He'll show you around, and 
introduce you to your other neighbours. 
You should pay great attention to what's 
said as you'll need all these chums on 
your side to succeed. It's a bit like the 
first part of <I>Ingrid's Back</I>, where you 
have to sort out their problems in order 
to recruit them to your cause. In fact, it's 
all very traditional Level 9 stuff, which is 
probably why the company bought the 
idea from Sandra Sharkey and Pete 
Gerrard (who he?) in the first place. 
Game design is by Pete Austin. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's tons of enjoyable stuff in here, 
and they've dug up (geddit?) every 
graveyard joke they can. I can spot my 
brother's jokes a mile off - they're the 
ones that make you groan out loud. But 
we don't play adventures just to enjoy 
ourselves, do we? We want problems to 
solve, and <I>Scapeghost</I> has some good 
ones. First, when you think about it, is 
that, as a ghost, you can't pick anything 
up as it slips through your ghostly 
fingers. But if you work on it, you can 
slowly improve your strength and be able 
to pick up a petal, if not quite crush a 
grape, fairly soon. Mind you, you can't 
escape the dreadful jokes even when 
solving the problems, as you'll find out 
when you try to help lift the curse that's 
befallen Edith Dean. In fact you can solve 
this in more than one way - all of them 
involving dreadful puns! 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if it's all such jolly fun, why isn't 
this a Megagame? Well, it's got niggling 
faults which make it all seem like a bit of 
a rush job. It may be unfair to say it, but 
the feeling seems to be "Well, it's our last 
one anyway, so it doesn't matter". There 
are a few typing mistakes in the text. If 
you ask Joe Danby to do anything you are 
usually told "Joe agrees", but then you 
discover he hasn't actually done what you 
asked. I asked him to pick something up, 
which I couldn't manage (more 
experienced ghosts know about these 
things), and he agreed, so we wafted all 
the way over to the other side of the 
graveyard, I asked him to drop it and the 
silly spirit hadn't picked it up after all! 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not quite up there with the Level 9 
classics, but you'll still be missing a lot if 
you don't buy it. So long, lads, and 
thanks for all the fun.
