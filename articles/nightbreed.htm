<div><b>It's deep-breath time here, I'm afraid. (Ah-haaaah!) 
Right, that's better. You see, 
I've just realised what an awful 
lot of explaining I've got to do - 
<I>Nightbreed</I> being one of those 'multimedia 
experience' thingies, you see, with a film, a 
comic, a book and all sorts to get through 
before we can even mention Ocean's 
computer games effort. In fact, I think I'll 
have to take another deep breath. (Ah- 
haaaaah l) Right, here we go... </b>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, to start off with you may remember us 
going on about the <I>Nightbreed</I> computer game 
quite a few times now (going back as far as a year 
or so ago). The whole kit and caboodle was 
originally meant to come out shortly after last 
Christmas, but the film's been put back and put 
back so many times now (with all sorts of new bits 
being added to it, old bits taken away and so on) 
that we'd more or less given up hope of ever 
seeing it at all. (Programmers Painting By 
Numbers apparently more or less finished the 
Speccy version six months ago, and have been 
sitting on it ever since.) 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then - suddenly - the film was on for 
release again! It should be out in September 
sometime (ie in a couple of weeks from when 
you're probably reading this) and of course all the 
merchandising is geared up to follow suit. Let's 
just hope the delays haven't been because the 
movie is hopelessly crap, eh, Spec-chums (as has 
rather unkindly been suggested around this 
office), because Ocean have actually done a rather 
spitting little job of the conversion. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>So who exactly are 
the Nightbreed then? </b><br>
Basically, the idea goes something like this. 
There's this big underground city (Midian) stuck 
out in the Canadian wilderness somewhere, which 
is kept totally secret from the outside world. And 
why? Well, because that's where all the monsters 
live, of course - the twist being that most 
monsters (who call themselves 'Nightbreed' - 
hence the name of the game etc etc) are actually 
quite shy and peace-loving and would like nothing 
better than to be left alone, unhounded by 
humans. Of course, as you probably guessed, that 
is not to be. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Nightbreed</I> tells the story of what happens when 
a rather disturbed young man called Boone (the 
chap you play in the game) searches out Midian 
(for reasons I'll explain in a minute) and in doing 
so unwittingly leads a bunch of redneck neo-Nazi 
types to its door. Of course, at this point all hell 
breaks loose, with 'The Sons Of The Free' (the 
rednecks) breaking out a secret stock of military 
weaponry (flamethrowers, rocket launchers etc) 
and doing their best to destroy the Nightbreed, 
while Boone attempts to rescue them all. Yep, the 
whole thing's a big, giant fight in other words, with 
Boone rather awkwardly caught in the middle 
(throughout most of the game, both humans and 
Nightbreed are out to kill him). 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This being the case, what sort of computer 
game do you think they came up with to best 
illustrate it all? That's right, it's a beat-'em-up, 
though it's not a straight beat-'em-up a la <I><a href="shadowwarriors.htm">Shadow 
Warriors</a></I>, but more of a slightly cerebral, walking-around-a-bit, mapping-the-mazes-of-rooms, 
picking-up-the-odd-weapon sort of thing. (In fact, 
the gameplay reminds me more of <I>Last Ninja</I> than 
anything else.) All in all, it makes a welcome 
change from those film conversions where you 
have to plough your way through loads of 
multiloading sub-games which have precious little 
to do with each other. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few paragraphs ago I said I'd explain what 
Boone's doing in Midian in the first place. Well, 
he's a bit of a confused young chap, you see, 
who's got some sort of dodgy past and happens to 
suffer from a series of blackouts (or something) 
when he can't remember where he's been or what 
he's done. This being the case, his psychiatrist 
has been trying to convince him (and just about 
everyone else) that he is actually (without knowing 
it) The Mask, a mass-murderer who's been running 
around terrorising the neighbourhood - and 
Boone has fallen for it! That's why he's done a 
runner - a) to get away from his girlfriend (in case 
he chops her up in his sleep 
or something) and b) to find 
the mysterious Midian he 
keeps hearing about, because 
that's where monsters go, and 
being a human sort of a 
'monster' that's where he 
belongs (or something). Of 
course, you and I know he's 
not the killer at all - it's really 
Doctor Decker, Boone's 
creepy psychiatrist, who's 
trying to set him up! 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phew. But enough of this 
plot stuff. Let's talk about the 
game itself, shall we? 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>At last - the game!</b><br> 
You, as Boone, have a handful 
of tasks to complete. First, 
you've got to collect the three 
keys to Midian, one located on 
each level, which will involve 
defeating or 
avoiding lots of 
Sons Of The Free and an 
equal number of hostile Nightbreed. 
You've also got to free the Beserkers, a bunch 
of homicidal and totally uncontrollable 'breed 
normally kept locked up in the dungeons of Midian 
(since they're as likely to go for you as anyone 
else I'm not quite sure about the 'why's' of this 
one), then get baptised by Baphomet (the living 
god of the Nightbreed), free the 'breed from getting 
trapped underground and kill The Mask to rescue 
your girlfriend Lori. (Phew.) The game works by 
setting you a task (for instance, finding Baphomet 
and getting baptised), then when you achieve it 
giving you a dinky little animated reward sequence 
which tells you what you've got to do next. (Oh 
yes, I forgot to mention it before, but keeping 
yourself alive long enough to manage all this 
wouldn't be such a bad idea either.) 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's quite an uphill task trying to depict the 
rollercoaster, plot-twisting effect of a film like this 
in a computer game, but they've done pretty well 
actually. The play area - a fairly colourful flip-screen affair with big sprites and some nice 
touches (like lightning flashes <I><a href="myth.htm">Myth</a></I>-style on the 
surface screens), initially takes place in the 
graveyard that lies above Midian. It's, say, five or 
six screens wide, but three or four deep as well - 
you move into the nearer or further row of screens 
by walking backwards or forwards through the 
various arches you find littered around the place. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wander round these enough (fighting or 
avoiding men 
and Nightbreed as you go) 
and you'll eventually come across 
one of the ways down into Midian, which is laid 
out in the same sort of way. Drop further down 
again, and you'll come into lower levels of Midian 
yet. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not going to describe any more of the plot 
(working out what you've got to achieve and how 
you're going to do it is part of the fun of the game) 
but I will tell you what it's like to play. Um, it's 
good. Once you've sussed out the controls, and 
worked out using the Passkeys (inscribed tokens 
which let you into various areas of the game), 
you'll find Boone has a goodly number of moves 
he can use (kicks, punches, jumps, use of a gun 
should he find one etc) and the baddies, especially 
the weirder 'breed, are of suitably bizarre design, if 
occasionally a bit big and static. Visuals are all 
nice and large, and there are some neat little 
touches to them too (I like the Boone heads at the 
top of the screen which slowly get more skull-like 
as you lose energy, and the way he can 
temporarily change into a sort of vampire-thingie 
later in the game). This is a game that looks like a 
lot of time and effort has gone into it. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Negative points? Well, it is fairly hard (but then 
many people would class that as a good point, I 
guess) and the multiload can be murder in 
cassette format, but that's about it really. Midian 
could perhaps have looked a bit spookier, and the 
weirdo monsters aren't 
shown off to full effect in 
semi-monochrome 
Speccyvision, but that's 
just carping really. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's actually rather 
clever, and this slightly 
puzzley beat-'em-up-type 
format seems to me a far 
more satisfactory way to 
convert a suitable film 
than one of these grab-a-few-action-sequences-and-build-quick-sub-games-round-them efforts. 
Mr Barker's inventive (if 
rather icky) imagination 
comes through very well 
too. All in all, I'd say 
<I>Nightbreed</I> is a bit of a 
success really. Hurrah! 
(Wonder what the film will 
be like though?)

<center><b>WHO'S WHO IN <I>NIGHTBREED</I></b></center><br>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Boone</b> This is you. Everyone says you're 
secretly a mass murderer (and being quite a 
trusting sort of a chap, you believe them) so off 
you run to Midian (a place where monsters go to 
have their sins forgiven), unwittingly leading a 
redneck Nazi lynch mob there too. Oops! (It all 
ends up in a massive fight.) 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Nightbreed</b> The last remainders of an 
ancient race, they come in all sorts of bizarre 
shapes, sizes (and levels of dangerousness). 
Though lots of the Nightbreed are violent, most are 
generally passive and want nothing more than to 
be left alone. (They'd be lucky...) 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Sons Of The Free</b> A bunch of very 
unpleasant red-neck types, heavily armed with 
flame throwers, rocket launchers, machine guns 
and so on who are out to kill the Nightbreed. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Mask</b> The lunatic alter-ego of Doctor 
Decker, Boone's psychologist and secret mass-murderer. He deserves a good kicking basically.

COMPLETE FRUIT 
LOOP OR WHAT? </b></center><br>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Clive Barker is this spooky Liverpudlian horror 
writer who's managed to become rather famous 
rather quickly. Apparently he's quite good too - or 
at least he is according to the </I>Amstrad Action<I> team 
who live across the way in the </I>YS<I> reception area. 
They're experts on the subject. Let's go over and 
have a chat with them, shall we? 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A few minutes later.) Biimey! That didn't make 
much sense. Okay, here's a rough outline of what 
I've learned. </I>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Books Of Blood</b><I> Loads and loads of short 
stories - some dead scarey, some a bit crap, and all 
a bit horrible, One was about these demons who live 
at the end of the tube train lines and kill lots of 
people. Another was about these two villages in 
Yugoslavia where all the people tie themselves 
together into the shape of two giant wicker men, 
have a big fight and, um, kill lots of people. </I>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hellraiser <I>(and its sequel, </I>Hellbound</B><I> 
These were Clive's first proper films (he scriptwrited 
one involving some monster jumping out of a field a 
couple of years before but nobody's seen it). 
They're all about this mysterious Rubik's Cube 
which when twisted in a 'special way' opens up a 
door to another dimension. Then all these blokes 
with pins coming out of their faces come out and, 
erm, kill people. </I>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Weaveworld</b><I> Another novel, this one's 
apparently all about a carpet (or something). Oh, 
and tots of people getting killed too. </I>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Nightbreed <I>(and its book version, </I>Cabal) </b><I>
Lots of killing, etc etc.
