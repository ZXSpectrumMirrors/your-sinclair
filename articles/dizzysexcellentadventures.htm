<div><b>Eggs, eh? They're the perfect gift, 
and not just at Easter either. 
Glass eggs, stone eggs, 
Kinder Eggs, Faberge
eggs... the list is endless. 
Real eggs aren't bad either,       
there are hundreds of ways of cooking 
them and they're jolly tasty and good 
for you too. Yep, if eggs didn't exist 
we'd have to invent them. </b>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right, let's have a look at the game. When 
James wrote his Megapreview a couple of months 
back, there was still some uncertainty over what was 
actually going into this pack. Y'see, those cheery chaps 
at CodeMasters had so many beaut games that they 
just couldn't decide what ones to put in. But you'll be 
glad to hear that they've now made up their collective 
mind, got everything sorted and are ready to roll. 
Hurrah! Buy this bargainous box and in amongst the 
spare placcy bags and French words you'll find 
<I>Spellbound Dizzy, Prince Of The 
Yolk Folk, Dizzy Down The 
Rapids, Kwik Snax and Panic 
Dizzy</I>. The last two have been 
released before, but the other 
three are bona fide newies. 
Let's get the two mouldies out 
of the way first... 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b><I>Older than yesterday - 
Kwik Snax </I></b><br>
This was reviewed earlier this year in 
issue 62. Back then it was given a 
bunch of flowers, a box of chocs and 
an engraved plaque saying 'I'm a 
Megagame and I'm jolly ace." 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And guess what? It's still a stonker. The evil Wizard 
Zaks pops up once more and sends four of Dizzy's 
eggy friends off to separate 
islands. So each egg is left on it's 
little ownsome. It's an obvious job 
for that egg-about-town, Dizzy. 
Now, there's one thing I don't 
understand about zapper Zaks, 
how come he never sends Diz 
anywhere? I mean, surely he must 
have realised by now that    
wherever he sends 
those eggs, that darned 
Dizzy will soon find 
them. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dizzy's brief is to 
visit each island and 
rescue an egg on each 
one. Instead of your run-of-the-mill sun, sea and 
sand affairs; each island has a 
special theme - one's covered in ice, 
one's got loads of clouds to lounge 
around on, one's full of teddy bears 
and one's got a castle on it. Diz has 
to spend his time collecting fruit, avoiding meanies, 
negotiating mazes and picking up bonuses. It's 
especially brilliant if you think bananas are one of 
God's greatest inventions. Why? Cos there's screens 
full of them. Yum! 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you haven't already got it, then it's worth buying 
this compilation, <I><a href="kwiksnax.htm">Kwik Snax</a></I> is clear and
bright and great fun. In ish 62, Rich 
gave this 92&deg; and it's certainly a 
Megagame. <b>90&deg;</b>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b><I>Panic Dizzy </I></b><br>
This one's a bit different from most Dizzy 
games. Instead of running around 
collecting things and getting all hot and 
bothered, Dizzy just sits tight in the 
middle of the screen. This is the Codies' 
attempt at a Dizzy puzzler, it's a 
<I>Tetrissy/Klaxy</I> sort of game where 
different coloured shapes fall down from 
the top of the screen and you've got to 
get them in the matching holes at the 
bottom of the screen. Rich, our humble 
reviewer, gave <I>Panic</I> 49&deg; and a 
bit of a hard time. Boring and 
tedious, he called it. Now I think 
he was a trifle harsh, it is quite a 
simple game but I thought it was 
quite good. Call me weird, but I'm a puzzle fan, I 
actually like dropping little coloured things into holes. 
<I>(You're weird. Ed)</I> Rich thought that it was a game for 
the younger player and rated it accordingly. Personally, 
I'm all for the little ones having a nice, easy to pick up 
game to play. So I'm going to disagree quite strongly 
with Rich and give it <b>65&deg;</b>. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b><I>Younger than yesterday - 
Dizzy Down The Rapids </I></b><br>
The Codies have only just made up their 
mind to stick this one in. It's a 
conversion of a Nintendo  
game which sees Dizzy   
and his girly chum, Daisy, 
rolling around in a barrel. <I>(Eh? 
Ed)</I> Well, they're not actually rolling around, 
but the barrel is. It's just like that Burt 
Reynold's film where he's in a canoe, fighting 
furiously against the 
might of nature. You know, the one that 
always comes up in Trivial Pursuit. <I>(She's talking 
about Deliverance. Ed) </I>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yep, our Diz is a right little hero, and a gentleman at 
that. He's out to protect his woman from, amongst 
other nasties, trolls and sharks. Dizzy can't very well 
lay into these baddies, instead he's got to, erm, throw 
apples at them. Now, the idea of going down a 
turbulent river and throwing things at people will seem 
a bit familiar to those of you who have played <I><a href="toobin.htm">Toobin'</a></I>. 
It sounds similar, but it's actually a side-on view thingy, 
rather than a look-down-at-it thingy. 
Graphically it looks much the same as 
every other <I><a href="dizzy.htm">Dizzy</a></I> game, except it's got 
a bigger river than most. It's fun, it's 
sweet and it's quite good. Well worth 
the <b>84&deg;</b> I've awarded it. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b><I>Prince Of The Yolk Folk </I></b><br>
I really liked this one. It's your usual 
Dizzy affair. He has to wander around 
collecting lots of things like magic 
carpets and heavy pick-axes and 
getting lots of info from the people he 
meets in his travels. The kingdom is in a 
terrible state cos an evil troll has taken over the castle. 
The good king is away fighting in the crusades, so the 
pretty princess is left to the mercy of old Mr Troll. Dizzy, 
dude that he is, offers to rescue her. Hurrah! 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beginning of the game sees you trapped in an 
underground cavern with no visible escape route. You'll 
have to exercise the old grey matter a bit if you want to 
get out. But nay fret Spec-chums, it's set at a similar 
difficulty level to most of the previous Dizzy games. 
Find the exit and it's time to march over to the castle. 
Unfortunately, there's a big, green, blobby troll in the 
way and he's not going to let you pass. Not just like 
that, anyway. So it's time to go walkabout and meet 
lots of odd characters, like a mysterious ferryman who 
demands something valuable and a lion 
with a sore paw. It's all jolly good fun, but 
it's only got about 30 screens so it's not 
exactly humungus. So it can have <b>80&deg;</b>. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b><I>Spellbound Dizzy </I></b><br>
Originally, so my tomato sauces tell 
me, this was going to have 90 
screens. Good, eh? But! The rather 
wondrous Codies have decided that it'd 
be loads better if they went for 105 
screens instead. Crivens, gosh and 
by gum! Not only is it bigger, it's 
also more difficult, than <I>Prince Of 
The Yolk Folk</I>. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You, as Dizzy, have been a 
bit of a silly sausage and 
magicked all of your mates and 
your girly friend into the very 
depths of hell. Eek! Better go and find them, hadn't 
you? Once again, there's loads of daft objects to collect 
and use. Along the way there's stars to bounce into 
and plenty of fruit to keep those sugar levels at a 
steady rate. When Dizzy has a snack, his mouth moves 
in a most realistic manner. He's so amazingly sweet, 
his little face scrunches up with pain and he just looks 
so stunned when he knocks his head. I had an ace 
time playing this but it really annoyed the rest of the 
team. Not the game you understand, it was my 'oohs' 
and 'ahhs' that had them reaching for the vom bucket. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor Diz comes in for quite a bashing here, 
whenever he smashes into a wall or takes a tumble 
loads of little stars float around his head. It's very 
difficult to resist the temptation to hurl him into every 
solid surface, just to see what happens. You can even 
drown him! <I>(Linda, that's just horrible. Ed)</I> I know, but 
it's not as if he's real or anything. Don't worry, Spec-chums, I love Diz dearly and I wouldn't dream of 
hurting him. Ahem. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spellbound Dizzy is 
big, bold and beautiful. It's also 
the best game in the pack so I'd 
be a real meanie to give it 
anything less than <b>90&deg;</b>. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>All in all, <I>Dizzy's Excellent 
Adventures</I> is a stonker of a 
compilation. 
What's more, 
it's exactly 
what you need 
for the 
Christmas hols. 
Eventually you'll 
get really bored with cold turkey and mince pies, the 
pine needles will start dropping off the tree and the only 
choccies left will be the crap coffee creams. At this 
point of despair you'll be so glad that you bought this 
game. So think ahead mort petit bleu chapeaux, get 
down to your local gaming 
paradise and buy this. So 
what if you've only got 
enough money to 
buy the dog a 
present. Buy it this, 
it'll soon get bored 
when it discovers that 
cassettes don't smell 
of other dogs. Then you 
can nick it back. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<center><b>FIVE ACE WAYS OF MAKING YOURSELF REALLY DIZZY</b></center>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>1.</b> Put on the number one hit, Dizzy, by Vic Reeves and The Wonderstuff
and twirl around on the spot for the entire duration of said record.
<br><b>2.</b> Find a fairground, not easy at this time of year, and go on the waltzer five 
times in a row. It's best if you go on with loads of girls who scream a lot. Then you
get spun around by all the nasty men. Hurrah!
<br><b>3.</b> Find a hill, walk to the top and have a rest. When you've got your breath 
back, lay down and roll down the hill. It's blimmin' ace.
<br><b>4.</b> Buy the Jane Fonda workout tape and get a few cans of Devon custard in.
Watch the vid for a bit and eat all the custard. <I>(What, cold? Ed)</i> Yep. Then
stand on your head for half an hour.
<br><b>5.</b> Do fifteen cartwheels in a row.

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<center><b>EGG HE, OR EGGN'T HE?</b></center>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've always wondered about Dizzy, I mean - is he a real egg, as laid by hens? I don't
think he is. Real eggs are incredibly fragile, all you have to do is sneeze in their
direction and their shells begin to crack. Dizzy and his chums are all very active
eggs, they're always jumping around and rolling down hills and yet they remain smooth,
firm and distinctly ovoid. All this begs the question - what are they made out of then,
smarty-pants? Well, I've given the subject much thought and I think Dizzy's made of
mutton fat jade. It's fairly hard, so our Diz wouldn't break into a thousand tiny pieces
if he fell off a table and it's the right colour too. What's more, it'd explain why
<i><a href="dizzy.htm">Dizzy</a></i> games aren't full of mother hens rushing around and trying to sit on their
eggs.
