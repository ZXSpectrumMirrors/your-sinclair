<b>David Crane's not your average programmer. Firstly, he doesn't even look like a computer programmer. You know the stereotype -- young spotty and scrawny due to devotion to his Speccy beyond the call of nature. Well, Crane's even older than the Ed (gasp!), hairy and very, very big -- 6 ft 6' in his trainers. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, as Activision's foremost 'games designer', he turns his rather large nose up at the 'programmer' tag. Since he joined Activision as a founder member in 1981, more than six million of his titles have been sold worldwide. <I><a href="ghostbusters128.htm">Ghostbusters</a></I> has notched up over 100,000 UK sales on the Speccy alone. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He paid a fleeting visit to the UK at the end of October, to attend the British launch of his latest creation, <I>The Little Computer People</I>, which should be available on the Speccy sometime soon. </b> <br><b>Okay, so you're called a 'games designer' -- but isn't that just a fancy way of saying you're a programmer? </b><br> No, it's not. Anyway, I'm really a 'generalist'. I come up with the ideas, design the game and get involved in the programming. But it's really all down to teamwork. I head a team of technical people who're the best in the industry. A real good game requires good team concept -- there's a lot of mutual respect. <br><b>Your games are all bestsellers, but how do you suss out what's going to be a megahit? </b><br> We play a lot of games as games designers. We know what people are playing today, why they're enjoying them. We must design games people will enjoy a year from now. For example, when the market was flooded with space games, I did <I>Pitfall</I>. People obviously wanted it, it's been incredibly successful. Basically, I watch what other people are doing -- and try to do something different. <br><b>Do you personally research all your games? </b><br> When I was doing <I><a href="ghostbusters128.htm">Ghostbusters</a></I>, I spent a lot of time on research. I got hold of a video of the film and watched parts of it over and over again. Real spooky. <br><b>Didn't you get bored with the film? </b><br> No, I loved it. <br><b>How did you get involved in <I><a href="ghostbusters128.htm">Ghostbusters</a></I>? </b><br> Columbia and Activision approached one another to see how the film might lend itself to a good computer game. Discussions were underway before I got involved. When I was asked if I'd like to do <I><a href="ghostbusters128.htm">Ghostbusters</a></I>, I'd just seen the movie the night before so I went back the next day to see it again. I wanted to see how an original game might be designed based on the film. <br><b>Who's your favourite character in <I><a href="ghostbusters128.htm">Ghostbusters</a></I>? </b><br> The Marshmallow man... no, not really. I don't think I have one -- I just like the interaction between all the characters. <br><b>Do you believe in ghosts? </b><br> I don't actively believe in ghosts, although people have reported seeing them. I think there may be little computer ghosts. <br><b>Are you obsessed with little people because you're so tall? </b><br> No, it's not because I'm so tall ... I never really thought of it like that. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About a year ago my research team and I decided that little people inside computers were to blame for unexplained hardware and software performance. We decided to design a comfy environment to entice the little people out. The result was a 2 1/2 storey house where the little people go about their daily business, eating, sleeping, listening to music and playing the piano. Each little person has a name and is slightly different to the next, but all share basic traits such as responding to love and attention -- a pat on the head works wonders! <br><b>Isn't it all a bit daft? </b><br> Heck no. Back in the States there's a woman who bought three extra Commodore 64s just so her whole family could each have their own little person. <br><b>Hmmm, buying Commie 64s in the first place sounds a bit daft to me! Have you got any favourite little person? And is it true that some of them are transvestites? </b><br> Well, Wallace and I had a good time, and Zeke baked cookies once. As for the transvestites, I've never met one, but l guess there's all kinds living in these computers. <br><b>What are your plans for the future? </b><br> Nothing at the moment. I've just finished this one so I'm taking time off at the moment. I tend to limp along and then something suddenly hits me and an idea comes. <br><b>Are you a trainspotter? </b><br> What's one of them?
