<b> Well, well, well. Another month has passed and we're all about thirty days older. A strange thing, time, isn't it? If you want it to pass quickly, it passes slowly - but if you want it to pass slowly it literally zooms along. For everybody except me, that is - because I come from beyond this universe, and can control time at will. I am Gadgy The Mutant Ninja Duck from the planet Winny Winnoo. Actually, I'm not: I'm Matt Bielby from the planet Earth, and I'm in an incredibly bad mood. Onto you lot. </b> <p> <font size=4><b> BOVINE McSPONGIFORM</b></font><br> I am a mad cow-eek-eek, knock knock cuckoo! I am writing to say "Boing" and that <i>YS</i> is rubbish. And wicked. Cook them sausages, cook them sausages - NOW! Ooh yes, ooh yes - NEVER! Noee, noee, noee nanana. So can you - here he comes, baa, meow, woof woof. Please change your socks. <br> <b> Mad Ben <br> Forest Fields, Nottingham <br> </b> <br><i> Actually there's a new party game we play down here in Bath. It's a bit like Pass The Parcel, except instead of a parcel we use some opened tins of Whiskas "Supermeat". The tins (and a spoon) are passed from person to person until the music stops, whereupon the chump holding them has to take a mouthful. The game goes on for three weeks and the winner is the first person who stands up, starts walking round and round in circles and then drops, dribbling, onto the floor. Duncan normally wins. <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> MORE DEFENCE</b></font><br> I have a few things to say about <i>YS</i>. (Stop! Don't throw this letter away, I'm not complaining - makes a change doesn't it?) Mr Jeffreys sure has kicked up a stink. I am interested in computer sciences. I like them a lot, but if I want a mag with science in it I'll buy the Amstrad magazine (also published by Future), namely Amstrad Action. I read <i>YS</i> because it is amusing. And as for the smut and sarcasm, <i>YS</i> is a cartoony, funny mag, so Mr Jeffreys and Mr Breslin (ish 55) take note. <i>YS</i> is for laughs, and you obviously don't have many - so go and read some other magazine. <br> <b> Matthew Harrodere <br> Solihull, West Midlands <br> </b> <br><i> What do you mean? </i>YS<i> is a cartoony, funny mag? No it isn't. It's a highbrow publication aimed at Radar Operators and Air Traffic Controllers. Read carefully between the lines and you'll find equations, formulas for producing new types of computer chip and loads more besides. Pay more attention in future! <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> OVER TO YOU...</b></font><br> If you will permit me, I will organise for you the Readers Awards of the 1980's. Readers of <i>YS</i> decide what they think is the best Spectrum game of the eighties, then they send their vote to me. What do you think? <br> <b> Tim Stevens <br> Borrowash, Derby <br> </b> <br><i> I think that the Ecu (that special new European compatible money) is a perfectly sensible idea as an additional currency to the pound. After all, I love waiting in shop queues while the elderly and confused fumble with one, two, five, ten, and twenty pee pieces. Just imagine the "fun" when they've got some Ecu's rattling around in their purses as well. Will there be special checkout counters in supermarkets marked "less than five items (and Ecu's only)"? Only time will tell. <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> GOLDEN OLDIEST OF THEM ALL</b></font><br> In reference to your letters page in the June issue - Golden Oldie and Golden Even Oldier. At 63 perhaps I can cap that (although you're only as old as you feel). Five years ago my spine collapsed through arthritis - and after being bedridden for the first year I thought I would go doolally until I came across a copy of <i>YS</i>. I persuaded a friend to buy a Spectrum 48+ for me, so armed with some software and as many books on the subject as we could find I set about finding out what made it tick. Each month I would have my wife panting at the door of the newsagent waiting for your next copy of <i>YS</i> to see what new listings (which you used to publish) would appear. I'm sure it was the joy of typing in these programs that kept me from going mad. <br> <b> Mr A. C. Palmer <br> Barry, South Glamorgan <br> </b> <br><i> Was that a subtle hint? Are you trying to get me to print more listings by being nice rather than argumentative? Are you trying to send me on a massive guilt trip? Er, oh dear, I'm going mad! Pass the Whiskas someone! Oh, and here's a listing for you....

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> THIS MONTHS LECTURE</b></font><br> I would like to write to you to say how much your magazine has improved. I don't particularly wish this letter to be published, although you may have a different opinion. <i>(You must have a crystal ball. Ed)</i> I have been a 'quiet' reader for four years and have seen quite a few changes in computing. Call me eccentric but I still like the Spectrum. I find it cheap and efficient for my needs. <i>(Oo-er. Ed)</i> Your magazine has helped me with some of the finer points of computing over the years, but... 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see the need for a wide spectrum of topics to be covered by any magazine, but if any magazine becomes too acute in its outlook it will lose popularity. Market research has proven that people use computers for leisure purposes. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I won't be a hypocrite - I love to play computer games. I also like computing as a topic. Yes. I see your point. We don't want an incredibly boring technical magazine about using the Spectrum as flight controller on your first aerospace mission. But come on, keep the work going! You've introduced a few new topics. These subjects sell magazines too. (Although by the time you're only interested in sales it is time to stop). Keep a balance. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Spectrum is an old machine and will eventually phase out, we all know that. But at least your little addition could make it last a little longer, surely? Versatility is the only way to survive. After this lecture I think I'll put on some WASP, load up <i><a href="rtype.htm">R-Type</a></i> and have a good blast. That is allowed isn't it? <br> <b> James Cuff <br> Preston, Lancs <br> </b> <br><i> Yes, that was a little bit of a lecture, wasn't it: so you deserve one back. Right, listening to WASP and playing </i><a href="rtype.htm">R-Type</a><i>. No, it most certainly isn't allowed. As Mr Jeffreys would no doubt agree, heavy metal music is the music of the Devil while </i><a href="rtype.htm">R-Type</a><i> is a degenerate and mindlessly violent game. Together they can only serve to turn you seriously squiffy. You'll be axing people to death next. I suggest you make a hot mug of Ovaltine and tune into Praise Be (with Thora Hird). <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> MATT'LL FIX IT</b></font><br> I am a fourth year student at Stowmarket High School. As part of my GCSE Integrated Humanities course I have to produce a Personal Research study. This means I have to choose a subject and produce a project on it. The subject I have chosen is how the development of technology has affected the printing industry. I would be grateful if you could supply me with any information on this subject, especially how your magazine used to be printed and how it is printed now. <br> <b> Anthony Smithies <br> Eye, Suffolk <br> </b> <br><i> No problems. Well, back at Dennis Publishing we used to use the 'potato printing method'. We'd cut loads of King Edwards in half and, using lino, cutters, carve the mirror image of all the reviews and pictures into their fleshy undersides. Then we'd get blank pages assembled, cover the potatoes in different coloured inks and literally stamp them down onto the paper, thereby producing a magazine. Here at Future we use the more up-to-date Desk Top Publishing approach, where everything is done on computer screens. Call me old fashioned if you like, but I still prefer the potatoes. <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <TABLE align=center BORDER BGCOLOR=white BACKGROUND=""><TR><TD> <FONT SIZE=6><B><U>STAR LETTER</U></b></font><br><font size=4><b> AND IN THE RED CORNER...</b></font><br> I have the answer to the underpants question by Martin Van Spanje in ish 55. The Dutch underpants look like the knickers used in the lambada. Instead of them, we have classy Y-fronts and boxer shorts. I rest my case. Here are some Y-fronts and briefs from the future: 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><center><a href="../thumbs/letters/big/57a.jpg"><IMG SRC="../thumbs/letters/57a.jpg"></a></center><p> <br> <b> Jason "The" Knight <br> Maidstone, <br> Kent <br> </b> <br><i> Well done. Do any other countries reckon they've got the best underwear? We'd all be very interested to hear from you. <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> </td></tr></table><p> <font size=4><b> CRAP BEAT-BOX</b></font><br> I guess you've had enough of crap poems (and that rap that Plug One of De La Soul couldn't do), so I've decided to write a Human Beat-Box. Here goes... "Puh kri puh puh-puh kri puh kri puh-puh." Hmmm, I think it loses something in print. Anyway, continuing with this letter, I want to complain (sorry). In your advert you say that everybody who applies to be staff writer has to be 18 or over. So how come you employ Rich, who is just taking his GCSE's? <br> <b> Richard Anders(s)on <br> Gloucester <br> </b> <br><i> He's incredibly thick, and these are his 89th re-takes. He's actually 77. The only reason I employ him is because he's cheap. <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> NOT A HAPPY BRAZILIAN</b></font><br> I just happened to buy <i>YS</i> for the first time, and I was very disappointed to discover that there was no tape at all, although the cover said that there should be one. And I was quite sad to discover that the tape didn't come with the mag outside the UK! I don't think it's fair at all! In this very issue there was a letter from a Dutch dude complaining about the same problem and you "kindly" suggested that he hop on a boat once a month and buy his copy of <i>YS</i>. "And you don't even have to pay for passage either - you could offer to swab the decks instead"(!!!) Are you going to "kindly" suggest that I SWIM across the Atlantic Ocean to buy my copy of <i>YS</i>? Okay, I have already considered getting a subscription, but it gets so difficult and expensive (red tape, you know) that I simply gave up! What do you have to say about that? <br> <b> Luciano Silveira Do Espirito <br> Santo <br> Santos, Brazil <br> </b> <br><i> Tut tut! You do give up easily, don't you. And I'm not going to suggest you swim the Atlantic - I'm going to suggest that you learn "matter transference", whereby you split your body into its component atoms and "beam" them over to Britain. It's easy once you know how. Actually (and to stop being churlish for once) we are sorting out this "tapes on mags outside the UK" business. You may not think it, but I'm on your side. Really! Just hang in there. <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <TABLE align=center BORDER BGCOLOR="#208020" BACKGROUND=""><TR><TD><center><font size=6><b>THE WONDERFUL WORLD OF SPECCY</b></font></center><p> <b>Every month we receive loads of letters from around the globe. Sometimes they make sense and sometimes they don't. Here's one that doesn't. (It's from Italy). </b> <p> <font size=4><b> DOUBLE FRUSTRATION</b></font><br> Help! I have just (but writing is a very long hard work...) received <i>YS</i> 54 but, horrible sight, without Smash Tape inside! Double frustration: first tape missing, second the impossibility to restore the case often smashed and crumbled like rice crispies but I like 3-D puzzles! After a first reaction very similar to the cover picture by G. Fabry and a bit of investigation I was sure that there were no holes in the plastic envelope neither Smash Tape reduced to picoscopic proportions with the incredible shrinking ray. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So: maybe it has been used as fuel for your train time machine going into the "Future"? I suspect also that PC1 in Scene Six at Bath police station: if he is able to look like the King of Spain he probably knows some other thievish tricks. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On page four, also in issue 52, David's expression made me suspicious: he could have stolen my tape to re-sell it on the black market to pay the poll tax. I was not able to reach a conclusion, however that may be. Thatcher's cuts to social expenses seem to be really very hard if you must travel 122 miles to go to the "Bath". <br> <b> Carlo Maria Vireca <br> Novate Milanese, Italy <br> </b> <br><i> If David did nick your tape it certainly wasn't to help him pay his poll tax. He isn't going to pay, you see. None of us are. Ha ha ha! We'll rot in jail first, and that's no joke. Thatcher's crew are already pretending that more people have paid than actually have (like they did when Poll Tax was brought in in Scotland) but nobody's fooled. Oh, and sorry about the tape, these things happen sometimes. Still, you get a badge out of it. <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> </td></tr></table><p> <font size=4><b> I CAN HELP!</b></font><br> I am a Graphic Product Design student and for part of my GCSE course I have to do a project about some area of the design world. I have chosen to study the front covers of magazines and to see how they differ according to the type of reader they want to attract. Your magazine is one of the ones I have chosen to use for my project. I would be grateful if you could tell me what kind of readers you try to attract and how you arrange the cover to catch their eye. <br> <b> Emma Porter <br> Stevenage, Herts <br> </b> <br><i> Well, there are many formulas - depending on the type of magazine we're talking about. </i>YS<i> falls into the Someone Hitting Someone Else/Someone Covered In Blood/Someone Holding A Weapon/Fast Sports Car camp. I used to work on a periodical called Tractors Monthly where each issue we would have a picture of a tractor. Pop magazines have pictures of pop stars, car magazines have pictures of cars, war magazines have pictures of people being carried around on stretchers and so on. Here's another project for you - design a cover for a tree surgeon's magazine. <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> OLD VERSUS NEW</b></font><br> Like many Speccy owners, when I buy new software I forget about my old software. Buff! Last week I looked at some of my old games, like <i><a href="commando.htm">Commando</a></i>, <i>Into The Eagles Nest</i>, <i><a href="futureknight.htm">Future Knight</a></i> and many many more. They may not have the graphics, speed and sound of something like <i><a href="chasehq.htm">Chase HQ</a></i>, but they are great fun. Just because they're old doesn't mean they're crap. <br> <b> Donal O'Duibhir <br> Raheny, Dublin <br> </b> <br><i> You obviously haven't met my Gran. <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <TABLE align=center BORDER BGCOLOR=cyan BACKGROUND=""><TR><TD> <table align=left><tr><td align=center><IMG src="../thumbs/letters/trainspotter.jpg"><br><font size=5><B>TRAINSPOTTER<br>AWARD</b></font></td></tr></table><font size=4><b> PILLOCK</b></font><br> I'd like to say "Matt's a pillock" and why? Because in the June ish, on the <i><a href="turrican.htm">Turrican</a></i> preview he said "There are nine weapons, and here they all are." But you only printed seven, and if I don't get a Trainspotter I'll throw a tantrum and cry. <br> <b> Anon <br> </b> <br><i> And I don't even have to make up some ridiculous lie to get out of it! You forgot to enclose your name and address you clot! Ho ho ho! <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> VOLCANO LAND</b></font><br> Hi! It's me again, and this time I claim a Trainspotter Award. On page 29 in issue 54 Aritus from Portugal claimed a Trainspotter because he thought <i><a href="backtoskool.htm">Back To Skool</a></i> was a spelled wrong. You claimed he was wrong, and that "skool" was right, not "school." You're right. But! The game is rightly called Bak To Skool, not Back To Skool as you wrote! So there. <br> <b> Agust Arni Jonsson <br> Reykjavik, Iceland <br> </b> <br><i> God, you Icelanders. You all think you're so blimming clever, don't you. First Magnus Magnusson, then The Sugar Cubes and now Agost "Arni" Jonsson. There's something you don't know though. There's a series of jokey books you can buy over here, concerning the exploits of a schoolboy and his chums. One of these books has the title Back To Skool, which is where the computer game title was nicked from. Gotcha. Better luck next time. <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> DODGY MOVES</b></font><br> Concerning the Beat-'Em-Up Guide in ish 53. In the box labelled Moves That Changed The World, under the heading The Pile-On, you said that it was when someone grips you from behind and someone else duffs you in. Bodge! A Pile-On is when someone leaps on a downed person, and someone else leaps on him and so on until you've got a pile of people. I demand a Trainspotter. <br> <b> Luke B <br> Wisbech, Cambs <br> </b> <br><i> I phoned up the Electricity Board to see what they thought, and apparently we're both wrong: a Pile-On is in fact a large metal structure that carries high voltage electricity cables - it's purpose being to electrocute small children who fly kites. <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> </td></tr></table><p> <font size=4><b> EASY PEASY</b></font><br> <p><center><a href="../thumbs/letters/big/57b.jpg"><IMG SRC="../thumbs/letters/57b.jpg"></a></center><p> <br> <b> James Steed <br> Ilminster, Somerset <br> </b> <br><i> Here's what I took it to mean: '</i>YS<i>, envelope me hat chopzes baseball-bat else I will envelope you all the helmeties of the sheet of paper crash one by one needle."
