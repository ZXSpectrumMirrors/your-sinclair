<p> <font size=4><b> THEY DON'T LIKE IT UP 'EM!</b></font><br> I am writing to express my great displeasure when on purchasing my December copy of <i></i>Your Sinclair<i></i>, which I may add I have on order and receive every month, I discovered no tapes. I did ask the "rather nice chap behind the counter" who assured me that none had arrived. As a serviceman in Germany where tapes are hard enough to come by I feel greatly cheated. <br> <b> Cpl Hill <br> BFPO <br> </b> <br><i> What, upsetting 'our boys overseas'!? A rum to-do and no mistake! I'm sorry to hear that you feel this way. But may I just point out that, because of several difficulties encountered with cover-mounted tapes, we have decided to ship them on subscription issues only. If, as you tell me, you receive every issue on order, then wouldn't a subscription be a better idea? It should work out cheaper, you'd get all the Cover Tapes, and you may even receive the mag sooner than your newsagent. I'd say you'd be quids in, but, just to keep morale high amongst 'our lads', please accept a corking </i>YS<i> badge. <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> E = mc + 2A</b></font><br> I have found a way of turning previously incompatible +2A games into compatible +2A games! What you do is take a +3 Basic (from the opening menu) and then type in SPECTRUM, press Enter, type LOAD"" (J""), press Enter, start your tape and there you have it! This works with <i><a href="afterburner.htm">Afterburner</a></i>, <i><a href="scoobydoo.htm">Scooby Doo</a></i>, <i><a href="flyingshark.htm">Flying Shark</a></i> and <i><a href="supremechallenge.htm">Starglider</a></i> (Merge "", SPECTRUM then GO TO 20). <br> <b> Steven Lycett <br> Sheffield <br> </b> PS Hold down break on the <i>Canyon Warriors</i> control screen, and you get a secret message! <br> <br><i> Since our office +2A is 'totalled' at the moment, I can't actually confirm what you're telling me. Still, if it works then a lot of +2A owners could be well chuffed. Good show! <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> ...AND SO ARE NEWSAGENTS!</b></font><br> Regarding your remarks on the front page of the <i>Your Sinclair</i> November issue, I assume that you are referring to "the nice chap behind the counter", in other words my husband! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What you are inferring is that it is my husband who is removing the tapes and not some dishonest customer. I strongly object to the wording. You are insinuating that newsagents, who work a 14 hour day, seven days a week, are thieves!!! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You should in future aim your remarks at the people on the other side of the counter - not behind it! <br> <b> Mrs E Ward <br> Fife <br> </b> <br><i> We're very sorry to hear that you took offence from our missing tape message. In fact, we weren't suggesting that anybody was 'thieving' the tapes at all, either in front of 'the counter' or behind it. We were merely alerting customers in a 'light hearted manner' to the fact that they should receive a free tape. If this is missing then there is a possibility it has been removed to be distributed at the counter. (We are told that some newsagents pursue this course of action for security reasons.) Some of my best friends are newsagents and I find them to be jolly hard-working and upright salt-of-the-earth type people. <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> BELLY BUTTON FLUFF BY ANY OTHER COLOUR...</b></font><br> I want it! (Fnar! Fnar!) I'm talking about the three games! Here are my three reasons. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) I'm a member of Rolf's Cartoon Club. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) I have bought every single <i>YS</i> since I received my humble Speccy two years ago AND I've bought every single ZERO published (even though I don't own an ST or an Amiga). 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) I have enclosed some fluff from my friend's belly button. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><center><a href="../thumbs/letters/big/50a.jpg"><IMG SRC="../thumbs/letters/50a.jpg"></a></center><p> 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bye bye, yibble yibble, <br> <b> Sir Clive Sinclair <br> Saxilby, Lines <br> </b> <br><i> Hmm, I can think of three reasons why you shouldn't get three games. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) You're not Sir Clive Sinclair at all, you're Ric Bradley from Saxilby. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) We suspect that your so called 'belly button fluff' is an imposter! Everyone knows that belly button fluff is always blue! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) You are quite obviously completely hatstand. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mind you, you do have two things in your favour, one that you like Rolf Harris, and two that you have remarkable taste in computer mags! Now let's see.. that's two reasons in your favour and three against. That's... er, Dunc? <b>Ed.</b> 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's minus one! <b>Dunc.</b> 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Er... (are you sure?), okay, you owe us one game! <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> GROODY BROWNED OFF</b></font><br> I figured it was about time I wrote to you. I was prompted by reading a letter from that particularly uncool and groody(TM) guy (or whatever), Psi 45, who, I assume in a fit of rudeness, wrote to you saying, in the worst possible taste, "49ers kick ass". I don't understand how anyone could say this about the best American football team in the universe. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I have a bone to pick with you. About a year ago you reviewed <i><a href="operationwolf.htm">Operation Wolf</a></i>. In your review you put beg, borrow or steal a copy. Well, someone begged me to borrow my copy. They borrowed it and, due to the fact that I haven't seen it for a year, I think I can safely assume it has been stolen. So you owe me a game (or five)! <br> <b> Ian Rohe <br> Dunstable <br> </b> PS Batman will never be out, same with Judge Dredd. <br> PPS This was written with a New York Giants pen. <br> <br><i> What do you mean </i><a href="batman.htm">Batman</a><i> will never be out? It is out, you clot! The new Judge Dredd game is destined for release mid-1990. This was written with a Stabilo Boss biro. <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> ED CASE</b></font><br> I have decided to resort to bribery after not having had my letter published for the 9,999,999th time. I have enclosed a cheque for &pound;1,000,000. Happy spending! <br> <b> Mike Walpole <br> Wolverhampton <br> </b> PS Is it true that you are a relation to the famous talking horse, Mr E d? <br> <br><i> Look, what is it with you lot?! I am not Edd The Duck I am not Ed The Horse and I am not Gadgy with the big ears! I'm Gadgy The Duck!... No! I mean I'm Edd with the big ears!... No no! Arrgh! You've got me all confused! (But thanks for the dosh.) <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> CAT JOBS</b></font><br> Please tell me - 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) Is Jackie really that short? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Does T'zer like her new job? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) Where can I get more info on the Sam Coupe? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4) Why do cats always 'perform' in the coal? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5) Please let me win one of your compos! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6) Is <i><a href="theuntouchables.htm">The Untouchables</a></i> really that good? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7) Will my Speccy games work with the Sam? <br> <b> Gordon Quinlan <br> Co Cork, Eire <br> </b> <br><i> 1) I'm not saying Jackie is short, but her apartment is so small that even the mice have hunchbacks! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Yes. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) The latest news on the Sam Coupe can be obtained from the Sam Coupe 'hotline'. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4) Why do dogs always perform in sand pits, eh?! Perhaps you should write to </i>Arthur C Clarke's Mysterious World<i>. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5) That depends on you getting the answer right and being chosen! Rest assured, no strings will be pulled! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6) Uh-hu. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7) We're told that most 48K games will run, but not 128K games.

Anyway, the picture we used for our Stealth Fighter Compo was, as you correctly recognised, the Stealth Bomber. Very clever, my friend, but there's one thing you've slipped up on.

This noticeable mistake is on every page and is so noticeable that even a short-sighted rampaging warthog with Rolf Harris riding it, whilst eating a soft boiled egg with chocolate dressing, would notice it!

Hear ye! <br> <b> David 'Yup' Willis <br> Kings Lynn <br> </b> <br><i> Rolf Harris, he's a blimmin' toff, isn't he? I deduce from your claim, and from your mention of Rolf's name, that you have some connection with Australia.

Either that or you're one brick short of a load. <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> HUGE HAM</b></font><br> Dear oh dear oh dear! Myself and about three thousand others are very upset. We have been very insulted. In <i>Future Shocks</i> in the December issue of that, until now, good magazine of years, <i>YS</i>, <i>Out For The Count</i> was previewed. At the bottom of this you spelt 'Higham' as 'Hugham'. So I think you should send out three thousand Trainspotter Awards to the people of Higham and me. <br> <b> Chris Dunkley <br> Rushden <br> </b> <br><i> Sorry about that. You see, that bit of </i>Future Shocks<i> was written by a member of staff who shall remain nameless, but who has certain hippy leanings. He thought he could make the world a more harmonious place by renaming Higham as Hugham (Hug 'em, geddit?). If I'd written it, I'd've called it Hit 'em, alright?
