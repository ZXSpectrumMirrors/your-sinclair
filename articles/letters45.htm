<b> Hello, me again - <b>Matt 'Goss' Bielby</b>, your leader (hem hem) - and I'm in an extremely bad mood today. Mind you, I'm always in an extremely bad mood, so that's not particularly unusual. Oh look, there's a fly happily buzzing around in the middle of the office. Hmmmm... this heavy, rolled-up magazine should help him decide which direction to fly in next. Thwack!!! Ha ha ha - downwards. Right, onto you lot... </b> <p> <TABLE align=center BORDER BGCOLOR=white BACKGROUND=""><TR><TD> <FONT SIZE=6><B><U>STAR LETTER</U></b></font><br><font size=4><b> QUEEN'S COUNSEL FOR THE DEFENCE</b></font><br> I am replying to the letter by a certain Keith Taylor (ish 43) about the quality of <i>YS</i>. I utterly disagree with his comments. Here are my answers. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The <i>Penpals</i> and <i>Lonely Hearts</i> sections are meant to be a bit of a laugh. I mean, who would be interested in a "14 year old bore who likes <i>Mastermind</i> and ant breeding"? I certainly wouldn't - would you? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Okay, so there were a few mistakes in <i>Program Pitstop</i>. All magazines have mistakes. This was probably the Art Department's fault, who set the pages out. <i>(Oyoyoyoy, no it wasn't. Art Ed)</i> But who cares about a few mingy mistakes? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The Covergames are brill! What are you moaning for? It's only 50p (or thereabouts). If you don't like it then don't play it. You can always record over it with your very own sooper dooper game of <i>Basic Breakout</i>!! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The symbols for the reviews are very good (better than some mags I could mention but won't). They are clear and well thought out, Could you do better? I think not. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) What is wrong with the occasional bit of smut (oo-er) and sarcasm? If it wasn't there <i>YS</i> would become a boring magazine to read (like some other mags I could mention, but, again, won't). You were right about the <i>Adventures</i> section being good. Mike Gerrard does a brilliant job (although I'm still waiting for my game to be reviewed, hint, hint), as does Matt Bielby <i>(Yo ho. Ed)</i>, whose first issue as Ed was well hard! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So those are the facts. Take note Mr Taylor of Wybers Wood You are like your town - Grim(sby). <i>YS</i> will go on and on and on and on and <i>(Cue fade. Ed)</i>. Keep up the good work! <br> <b> Nick 'Shine On Harvey' <br> Moon <br> Dagenham, Essex <br> </b> <br><i> Marry me. <b>Ed</b>. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's against the law. <b>T'zer</b>. </i> <p> </td></tr></table><p> <font size=4><b> WHERE WHERE WHERE?</b></font><br> I have recently bought <i><a href="rtype.htm">R-Type</a></i>, and after playing it I noticed that Level Eight does not exist. In the May issue, J Parker described the same problem that I have, and you said to send the game back to Activision. But I want an address. Please, what is it? <br> <b> Carmac 'Ted' Nugent <br> County Wicklow, Ireland <br> </b> <br><i> It's a series of numbers and words intended to help the Post Office find wherever the place is you're trying to send a package to <b>Ed</b>. </i> <p> <font size=4><b> RECKLESSLY SPEC-LESS</b></font><br> I DON'T HAVE A SPECTRUM. I have a ... a... BBC (very loud laughter). It's not that bad a computer, actually. <i>(Yeah, lots of available games - ha ha. Ed)</i> 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've been reading your mag for ages now, but don't make this the Star Letter, 'cos I'll have nothing to play the games on. <br> <b> Stephen Drysdale <br> Letham, Perth <br> </b> <br><i> No sooner said than, erm, not done! <b>Ed</b>. </i> <p> <font size=4><b> TRIPE AND, ERM, ONIONS</b></font><br> Most of my pals are northerners, so stop taking the mickey. If you don't, I will come down there and knock your teeth so far down your throat you'll have to stick a toothbrush up your bum to clean them. <br> <b> Michael Helliwell <br> Castleton, Rochdale <br> </b> <br><i> That's how I normally clean them anyway. <b>Ed</b>. </i> <p> <font size=4><b> SPECTRUM DUNDEE</b></font><br> I bought a Spectrum in the winter of 1983 - you remember, the ones with the rubber keys that trapped themselves under the metal plate? Well, over the years, software over here in the country closest to the hole in the ozone layer has dwindled so much that being able to find one game for the Spectrum is about as easy as locating Salman Rushdie. <i>(He's in the basement of Boots on Chichester High Street. Ed)</i> So, every month I trek down to a little newsagent that stocks <i>Your Sinclair</i> (this is the only shop I've found that stocks it, by the way), hand over the money (all $6.50 of it) and tear home in my little buzzbox. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have one problem though. As you are reading this letter, I will have just got hold of the June issue. Great, isn't it? I mean, as if it's not enough that these idiots in NSW voted in the Liberal Party, which is led by a little stubble-headed person who looks like a frog and enjoys putting the car tax up to over $500 (my car's only worth $1,000) just because his wife got caught driving while under the influence! <i>(You what? Ed) </i> 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A couple of questions now. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) What happened to Clive Sinclair? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Is it true that it goes blue and shrivels up in cold water? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Is Margaret Thatcher for real? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Why are you so infatuated with Kylie and Jason? Over here it's a sin to admit to owning one of their compact discs. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) I'm 19, doing a BA degree course in Communications and I'd like to hear from ANYONE who owns a Spectrum. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Please, please, please, could you send me just one itsy-bitsy new release? I'll even suck the nobbly bits of your ears. <br> <b> Wayne McCrea <br> Newcastle, NSW, Australia <br> </b> <br><i> (1) He's getting married to a little cracker called Bernadette Tynan (except he isn't, 'cos they've just called it off). 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Ask Bernadette. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Yes. Unfortunately she's not just an extremely unpleasant dream. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Over here it's actually a law of the country that you sleep under a Kylie Minogue or Jason Donovan duvet cover. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) I've printed your full address. </i>[Which I've deleted - NickH]<i> 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) I'm not going to have the nobbly bits of my ears sucked by another man. And for daring to make such a disgusting suggestion I won't send you a game - unless I get outvoted by the readers. Come on, you lot, send a postcard to this address marked Shall We Send Pervy Wayne A Game? On the back simply write YES or NO. <b>Ed</b>. </i> <p> <font size=4><b> ROGUE PAGE</b></font><br> there?? And what are the keys? Please tell me as it's quite a good game! <br> <b> Michael Pettett <br> </b> PS Goodbye, T'zer, we'll miss you! <br> <br><i> Etm, apologies are in order here. I lost the first page of your letter - a gust of wind took it out of the window while I was munching on my 'Marks & Sparks Garlic Chicken Breast Pieces (Delicious Hot Or Cold)'! So, basically, as I hadn't read it before it whizzed off, I, um, haven't got the foggiest idea what it is you're talking about. And as your address disappeared along with the first bit of the letter I can't even send you a badge. Oh well, it's all part of life's rich tapestry (I suppose). I'll send your badge to Arthur C Clarke - that'll stump the chump when he opens his mail. <b>Ed</b>. </i> <p> <font size=4><b> +3 BLUES</b></font><br> I own a +3 and I'm very happy with it, but the one thing that drives me mad is that you never put a disk on the front of the mag. I've tried loading the tapes, but they just don't work. I use a Questar Lazer 1300 cassette player which claims to be compatible with my Speccy. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before you say anything <i>(Too late. Ed) </i>I've followed the manual to the word. Help! <br> <b> Adam Hill <br> Magor, Gwent <br> </b> <br><i> Tskl Pesky +3s. Right, first I'll say that if you've got the + 3Q model (the pink one) then you're jiggered before you start - they hardly load anything. If it's a 'normal' +3 it's going to be a question of fiddling around with the volume control - these machines are notoriously cantankerous I'm afraid. Oh, and you have got your cassette player tone knob on full, I hope. You haven't? You clot. <b>Ed</b>. </i> <p> <font size=4><b> VISITING CLOGLANDER</b></font><br> I'm coming to London soon and I was wondering, could you please give me a few addresses of good (big) software shops, so I can buy a lot of the newest Speccy games (as these aren't available in Holland any more)? <br> <b> Mark Roscam Abbing <br> Haarlem, Holland <br> </b> PS I've enclosed real Dutch candys, 'Zoute Drops'. <br> <br><i> Thanks for the 'Zoute Drops' - unfortunately they smelt so disgusting that nobody here had the guts to actually try one. Oh, and regarding your query - the Virgin Games Centre in Oxford Street is a good bet, but there are loads of other software shops scattered around if you hunt about. Ask one of our 'friendly' policemen. <b>Ed</b>. </i> <p> <font size=4><b> SPECTRUM VS ST</b></font><br> Round one. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I use my Spectrum for word processing as the package cost only &pound;30, whilst an ST package costs over &pound'100! (The ST's down, one... two... three... four... the ST's back up again!) 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ST has a better keyboard than the Spectrum! (Whooaa, the Spectrum dodged that one!) 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The newer Spectrums have proper keyboards, and anyway, the ST keyboard is rubber underneath, just like the Spectrum +. (Loook... the keypad's deflated.) 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I bought an ST for its graphics and lack of colour-clash. (Oh no, the Speccy is down on its heat-sink! One... two... three... it's back up again.) 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Games for the ST may be colourful, but you have to find &pound;20 to buy just one game! (There goes the ST mouse, cor.. what a right hook.) 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I still subscribe to <i>Your Sinclair</i> as it has more hip hop news, reviews and articles than any ST magazine! THAT'S IT, THE ST IS OUT FOR THE COUNT! That last punch was the one that did it. The Spectrum (seven years old) has beaten the ST (two years old) with that final blow A knock out! <br> <b> Keith Symonds <br> Basildon, Essex <br> </b> <br><i> Oh no... I've just spilt my coffee all over my new pair of espadrilles. The really annoying thing is that I was going to get a black pair, but they only had white in my size. And you know what that means, don't you? That's right - stain city! And I've got to make another mug of coffee. Erm, yes, it's tragic how crap most 16 bit mags are. We've had quite a few letters from people who upgraded but still buy </i>YS<i>. It's the only sensible thing to do. <b>Ed</b>. </i> <p> <font size=4><b> DAD'S A SKINFLINT</b></font><br> Hello. I am a 14 year old physical wreck. Most of my computer games are untrendy - I mean, can you remember <i>Orc Attack</i>?

It all started two weeks ago when I was playing <i><a href="robocop.htm">Robocop</a></i> (which I get when I subscribe to <i>YS</i>) on my Spectrum +3. Suddenly the TV went black and the computer went crazy. After a time I understood the computer wouldn't play <i><a href="robocop.htm">Robocop</a></i> on a long time. This is only the beginning on my problem. So, I looked for my old Spedrum 48K in the wardrobe to play <i><a href="robocop.htm">Robocop</a></i> on. After a little practice I reached Level Eight. I decided to save it on my Multiface 128 and so I did. I didn't make Level Eight, so I decided to try again (I had save it on the Multiface you know). <i>(Yes, you said. Ed)</i> 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And guess what happened, no the computer don't become crazy, the computer wouldn't load it!!! The tape recorder had went broken. So I have to try again, again, again and again but when I tried the sixth time THE TV SET WENT BROKEN. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aaaaaaargghhh! This is unbelievable. Now I can't play <i><a href="robocop.htm">Robocop</a></i> at all. What shall I do? I can't even use my computer okay, I can use my computer, but I have no TV set. What shall I blame? Shall I blame (a) <i>Your Sinclair</i> or (b) <i><a href="robocop.htm">Robocop</a></i> or (c) the bad computer, TV and tape recorder? Please help me!!!!!! <br> <b> Nils Hedstrom <br> Falun, Sweden <br> </b> <br><i> Dunno really. You could ask Arthur C Clarke but he's holed up in Sri Lanka.

So it was decided to publish a yearbook of the Spectrum users in France and other countries. In this book, each owner will indicate 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) model of Spectrum (48K, 128K, +2, +3), 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) main interests (games, programming, word-processing) and 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) name, address and if possible, number phone. <i>(You mean phone number. Ed)</i> 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have now nearly 300 owners registered from ten countries. But, of course, such a yearbook would be incomplete it there were no British owners in it! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your magazine is well known in the world, so we would be very pleased if you could let your readers know of our group and its project! They can write in English or French to CSAR. <br> <b> Claire Dyard <br> Aubrives, France <br> </b> <br><i> Okay, you lot, get your stamps out. We can't have a Speccy yearbook being passed around the planet without any residents of 'Blighty' included in it. I feel there are a couple of other things you ought to enclose as well as the above though... 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) A photograph (or photocopy*) of an elderly relative (with his/her name and age written on the back). 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) A small model of Buckingham Palace fashioned from Blu-tack. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) A freehand drawing of a circle (next to one done with a compass) to show the world how brilliant us lot are at, erm, drawing freehand circles. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*It's quite easy to photocopy an elderly relative. Just take them into a ProntaPrint store, jostle them over to a photocopier, close the cover bit over their heads and get the assistant to press the green button. Hey presto.

And what's wrong with 'Jase'? Okay, so he can't act, sing or dance, but he's got something far more important going for him... um... errr... ah yes - 'star quality'.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q: What's green, has six legs, 26 balls and would kill you if it fell from a tree? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A: A snooker table. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) A professional snooker table has eight legs, not six. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) There are not 26 balls, there are 22.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Count again, there are 82!

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Dear Madam Pico 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This isn't really an emotional problem, so I don't know if you'll print it - but here goes anyway. The next door neighbours have gone away for three weeks and I want to build an extension as quickly as possible. I've tried to build one before, but they got onto the council who told me I needed something called 'planning permission'. That's stupid! I own my garden, so surely I can build what I want in it. The neighbours moaned that my proposed extension would block out all the light in their kitchen, but they're just being selfish - besides, they've got electric light bulbs, so it's not as if they're going to be totally in the dark. Anyway, as I said, they've disappeared for three weeks so I'm going to go for it! Now, I'm not a professional builder (in fact, I work in a custard factory), but I've laid a couple of fairly neat patios in my time. The only problem is speed. Do you know of any 'short-cuts' I could take? I'd be much obliged, and if I get it up successfully I'll drop you an invitation to my next barbecue. <br><b>Jock Bloggins<br> Hampstead, London</b><br><i> You do have problems, don't you Jock? Hmmmm. Now, I'll tell you the first way to save some time and that's to do away with the foundations. Just lay down sand where the foundations should have been and start building your walls from there. Another tip is to not bother measuring things - just take everything as it comes. For instance, windows. Wait until your walls are up to about eight feet high and then simply smash holes where you want your windows to go. As regards the wiring well, the way I see it is you could just have an extension lead going through a hole in the wall from the main house. Just stick loads of three-way sockets on the end. Same idea goes for the plumbing (if you're going to have a sink in there) - first splice some kind of tube onto the main pipe, bung a tap on the end and push it through the hole in the wall next to the electric cable. Have it so empties itself into the garden. There's no need to plumb into the drainage system, as water evaporates on its own anyway. Good luck Jock.</i> </font></td></tr></table> <p> <TABLE BORDER=0 ALIGN=center VALIGN=center><tr><td align=right> <TABLE BORDER=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 bgcolor="black" background=""><TR bgcolor="black" background=""><TD><font size=2 color=white><i><b>Doodlebugs</b></i></font></td></tr> <tr><td bgcolor="black" background=""><a href="http://wos.meulie.net/pub/sinclair/./magazines/YourSinclair/Issue45/Doodlebugs/YS45Doodlebugs01.jpg"><IMG SRC="../thumbs/YS45Doodlebugs01.jpg" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=182 ALT="Doodlebugs"></a> </td></tr></table> </td><td><TABLE BORDER=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 bgcolor="black" background=""><TR bgcolor="black" background=""><TD><font size=2 color=white><i><b>Next Month</b></i></font></td></tr> <tr><td bgcolor="black" background=""><a href="http://wos.meulie.net/pub/sinclair/./magazines/YourSinclair/Issue45/YS45NextMonth.jpg"><IMG SRC="../thumbs/YS45NextMonth.jpg" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=446 ALT="Next Month"></a> </td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <p>
