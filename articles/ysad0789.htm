I've just had a spooky coincidence, possums. I opened a letter from <b>John Wilson</b>, the Rochdale Balrog, in which he happened to mention that he'd once sent a solution for <I>Sherlock</I> to a Captain in the Pakistan Intelligence Agency but never heard back from him, so he wondered if he'd disappeared on some mysterious mission! And then I pick up another letter from the same day's post and... lo and behold, it has a Pakistan stamp on it, and what's more, inside there's a letter signed by... a <b>Captain Nazir Ahmed</b>! Can they be one and the same? The plot thickens as Captain Ahmed asks me questions about... two of John Wilson's adventures! Spookier and spookier. While I ponder the meaning of this, and wonder whether Captain Ahmed can really be in Intelligence if he's stuck into John Wilson's games, here are the answers to his problems. To open the trap door in <I>Balrog And The Cat</i> you must DROWS EHT YRRAC and then ROOD PART ESIRP. (Well I never knew 'trap door' was 'rood part' backwards! Take me to your rood part at once! Ahem, control yourself.) In <I>Dark Night Sky</I> to get started you must ELDNAH LLUP/DRAOBHSAD LEEF/SYEK EKAT/ DRAOBHSAD LEEF. And in that order. Or possibly backwards. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My thanks to Captain Ahmed for sending me a copy of the <I><a href="ystop100_4.htm">Lords Of Midnight</a></I> keyboard overlay I'd asked for - and thanks to all the other readers too who were kind enough to rally to the call. Anyone missing the overlay can now send me an sae for a copy. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Scott Hillier</b> of Bristol urges me to tell him where the bead is in <I>Jack The Ripper</I>. TOLS NI NEP TUP. Scott also asks me to send him a solution to <I><a href="bugsy.htm">Bugsy</a></I>, which I can't do as it's not on my list of freebies. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite a few readers are just writing in asking me to send them solutions to any old Spectrum adventure, but, while I've got hundreds of solutions to games in my files, obviously I can't send them all out or I'd have nothing left myself. What I have done is to type some of these solutions up as freebies. I can print them out on my printer as required, so for an up-to-date list of what's available send an sae - and make it a small one as it's only a sheet of paper I'm posting to you after all. The envelopes some people send, you could fit a duvet in them. And if <b>John Kennedy</b> of Dunoon sends an sae I'll send him a freebie on The <I>NeverEnding Story</I> and tell him where to find help on <I><a href="knighttyme.htm">Knight Tyme</a></I>. And if the four John Waddington employees from Leeds care to have a whip-round for a stamped addressed envelope, I'll sort out their problems with a freebie for <I>Blizzard Pass</I>. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a recent Lost Souls column I said that I'd never heard of the adventure <I>Pilgrim's Progress</i>, which one reader was stuck on, and now <b>Jim Grimwood</b> of Hatfield has shed some light on my darkness. He says the game was published in October 1984 by The Scripture Union at &pound;0.95, was written by James Day and based on "the international best-seller by John Bunyan". (Well, it was in its day!) Though you didn't need the book to solve the game, a copy of the Bible came in handy. And finally Jim says he hasn't any useful hints to offer the lost reader who's not making any <I>Pilgrim's Progress</I>. Thanks anyway, Jim lad. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>James Handley</b> of Barnes suggests that anyone who's got Level 9's clue sheet for <I><a href="gnomeranger.htm">Gnome Ranger</a></I> should read clue number 44 and follow the instructions, I did - quite a giggle. Do give it a read. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loadsahelp needed by <b>Gavin James Welch</b>, London. How to get through the Forbidden Door in <I>St Brides</I>? First you must ROOD REDNU REPAP EDILS and then LICNEP HTIW ELOHYEK EKOP. What to do with the dragon in <I><a href="fuddoandslam.htm">Fuddo and Slam</a></I>? NOGARD YONNA OT MALS KSA. How to deal with the hawk in <I>Karyssia</I>? TELUMA ENIMAXE. Finally Gavin needs help that I don't have for part two of <I>Jekyll and Hyde</I>. He says he's bought the Soho flat, become Hyde and gone to Soho, but in those immortal adventuring words, WHAT NOW? Is the bearded figure of any relevance? How does he stop Enfield's mob from killing? (Stop saying things like loadsahelp, maybe?) Anyone who can help Gavin, contact him at the above address - Lost Souls is just brimming over at the moment. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has anyone seen a creative spark anywhere? If so, it could be the one lost by <b>Joe Wilson</b>, Sunderland, Tyne and Wear. Joe says he writes his own adventures using <I>GAC</I>, and he likes text adventures best. Don't we all? The trouble is, though, that Joe's lost the aforementioned creative spark and asks anyone who's got a decent adventure plot to get in touch with him for a 50/50 effort, with Joe doing the programming. He stresses that the plot must be well thought out, and not just a few scrappy ideas. If you're keen, contact Joe. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what's the next thing I see? Ye Gods, more spookiness. <b>Gareth Pitchford</b>, Ellesmere Port, South Wirral says he's just designed and mapped a funny adventure called <i><a href="microfairmadness.htm">Microfair Madness</a></I>, but doesn't have a utility. Would anyone like to <I>GAC</I> or <I>PAW</I> it for him? Well, just read the previous paragraph and call me a matchmaker. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Alan Chang</b> sends in lots of tips for <I>Golden Eggcup</I>, and also says he's found a batch of objects he hasn't any use for. What to do with them? WORRUB NI STCEJBO SSELESU LLA TUP. Anyone wanting help or even a solution on <I>The Never-Ending Story</I>, <I>Seabase Delta</I> or <I><a href="kobyashinaru.htm">Kobyashi Naru</a></I> should send sae's to Alan. And an <I>Eggcup</I> tip? If you lose any of your possessions go to the location NE of the bag. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Derek the Troll</b> writes from Great Yarmouth with excellent maps for both <I><a href="ystop100_4.htm">Lords Of Midnight</a></I> and <I><a href="ystop100_4.htm">Lords of Midnight</a></I>. <I>[Echo? –NickH]</I> He's just bought an Amiga and he says (and I quote), "It's my second computer, but not nearly as good as my olde 48K rubber keyboard Speccy!" Well, there you have it, straight from the troll's gob. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A quick hello, the noo, to <b>Melanie Movat, Margo Spence and Julie Henderson</b>, all from Baltasound Junior High School in the Shetlands, who write to me for help on <I><a href="tolkientrilogy.htm">The Hobbit</a></I>, which they're working on in school. One of them (and I name no names) says her teacher, Mr Thomson, has the solution book but won't show it to them. So she's in a mood with him. Rotten Mr Thomson, that's what I say! And rotten Melanie Movat, who called me the Sorceress. Why, the Sorceress is nothing like me. Apart from the beard, we've got nothing in common at all. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next a very brave soul, <b>Mr R. Reeves</b>, Northampton. Why brave? Because Mr Reeves wants to collect together the ultimate solution collection. He says it's often difficult to find full solutions to games because many people only give out clues and sheets can be expensive to reproduce. He is therefore prepared to try to collate everyone's efforts and produce a master catalogue of solutions. Anyone wanting to join in his scheme is invited to send a copy of their solutions to him and they'll receive full credit in the eventual tome. A generous offer, though with lots of rival schemes, such as Sonia Griffiths-Glover's Hints Archive For Lost Adventurers, I'm not sure if there'll ever be just one unified source. <I>[Cue advert for The Tipshop, www.the-tipshop.co.uk --NickH]</I> 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now to that mathematical genius, <b>Jim Donaldson</b> of Glasgow, who begins his letter by saying "I'm here again with a couple of problems... well, five to be exact." Thank goodness he didn't start with five problems. Among the questions are how to find the lamp in the hut in <I>Prospector</I>, as it doesn't seem to be there. First you must RENIM OT YEKSIHW EVIG. How do you lever the boulder with the staff in <I>Staff Of Zaranol</I>? Why not try to REDLUOB PMUJ instead? And how do you prevent the robbers from robbing you in <I><a href="jadestone.htm">The Jade Stone</a></I>? To do that you must frighten the robbers off by NAMSILAT EHT GNIYRRAC. Okay? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And finally some laughs - which I need after all these creepy coincidences. <b>Lee Davidson</b> from Selsdon suggests a few odd (some of them very odd) inputs that might raise a titter in Zenobi's <I>Behind Closed Doors (The Sequel)</I>. Try JUMP, CUT HEDGE WITH DAGGER, CLIMB OVER WALL, BURN HEDGE, KISS FROG and... hang on, the next one's not only obscene, I do believe it's also dangerous, illegal and a physical impossibility. Not to mention highly uncomfortable for the frog. CENSORED!!
