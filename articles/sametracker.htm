<div><b>Soundtrackers. Music 
sequencer programs. Roll 
those words around your 
mouth. I'm sure you all 
know the story behind 
these darned 'trackers, but for those 
of you who take five year long 
holidays in Mozambique, here's the 
story. (Steve sways from side to side 
in ultimately unsuccessful attempt to 
reproduce cinematic flashback effect.) </b>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beginning there was the Amiga, and 
an all-round good egg called Karsten Obarski. 
Being such a nice fellow, Karsten came up 
with <I>Soundtracker</I>. It was popular, to say the 
least, and was ripped off quite a bit. (Yikes.) 
Then Mahoney and Kaktus did <I>Noisetracker</I>, 
Fairlight did <I>Startrekker</I> (ho ho) and various 
other people did their little bits to help the 
soundtracker concept evolve to its full 
potential, or something. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One bright, crisp, Polish day, BZYK decided 
to copy it to the Speccy, because all other 
music creation programs, especially <I>Wham! 
The Music Box</I> were complete crap. (Yea 
verily.) And, to put it frankly, the world of 
Spectrum demos was changed overnight. 
Well, obviously 'overnight' is a relative term. It 
probably was an overnight revelation if you 
happened to live within BZYK's postal district, 
thus ensuring your copy of the prog arrived 
within 24 hours. Programmers further afield 
had to wait a little longer, so perhaps it would 
be fairer to call it an 'over a variable amount 
of time' revelation. Yes. Sorry, where was I? 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life went on, and the SAM was released. 
But lo! There was no 'tracker on the Coupe! 
So, one equally bright, crisp, Polish day, Mat 
and Kaz of ESI took the production of the 
wonder program into their hands, and after 
numerous late nights, <I>E- Tracker</I> was born. (Lo! 
Yea! Etc.) 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SAM has been crying out for a decent 
music package for ages, as far as I recall. 
Correct me if I'm wrong, but there's only been 
<I>The Sound Machine</I> and that made little more 
than a shallow dent in the huge lump of Silly 
Putty that forms the SAM user 
base. Let's hope that this one 
is received a little better. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, so on first glance it 
looks more like a freaky 
monitor than a music program, with its six 
windows displaying lots of pure hex. This is 
what has made the 'tracker family popular, 
believe it or not. Rather than traditional music 
notation, the whole caboodle is organised as a 
rather funky sequencer, and the hex gives you 
near total control over the entire soundchip. 
What distinguishes <I>E-Tracker</I> from the 
Speccy's dearly beloved <I>Soundtracker</I> is the 
fact that it's a piece of commercial software. 
(The original was PD and - shriek! - free.) 
However, this isn't as bad as it might sound to 
prospective owners, as you get the benefit of a 
well-written manual into the bargain. People 
who have used Speccy <I>Soundtracker</I> will be 
performing leaping handstands at this news, 
because the original came with, er, nothing. 
You had to figure out this immensely 
complicated program for yourself. Anyone who 
could actually do it qualified for tea with the 
Queen, or something, but now, thanks to the 
wonder of modern science and manuals and 
things, you can quite happily design 
instruments and trigger ornaments with little 
more than a GCSE in Maths. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, it would be pretty useless if you 
couldn't use the tunes you slaved over outside 
the program, so, just as with the Speccy 
<I>Soundtracker</I>, you get a compiler as well. Just 
write your song, squirt it through the compiler 
and you've got a standalone routine to call 
every frame. Hassle-free and fussless. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I know <I>E-Tracker</I> will be a success. It's 
just right for really lazy demo coders, and I'm 
speaking from experience here. Six channels - 
eee, luxury. Bundled with the prog are a few 
useful bits and bobs: a nice conversion of 
Enola Gay by OMD and a token version of 
Axel F (with the obligatory wrong bit in the 
middle), several instruments and a warbling 
ornament. That little lot should set anybody off 
quite nicely, and before you know it you'll be 
tweaking the instruments and everything. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faults? I've found a few. The prog as a 
whole seems pretty well debugged (although 
I'm sure someone will be smugly pointing out 
something or other before the ink's dry on the 
issue) but the, er, classically-styled interface is 
a bit clunky. You have to scroll through all the 
options on a menu rather than being able to 
get to one straight away - glerp. Still, can't 
quibble over the results- all you need 
is talent, as they say. And a bit of 
patience. And lots of time. Er,
and a SAM might be handy.
