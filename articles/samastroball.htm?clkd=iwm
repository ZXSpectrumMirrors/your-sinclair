<b>You can't keep a good ball 
down. Fresh from her 
triumphantly Megagamed 
debut on the Speccy, 
<I><a href="astroball.htm">Astroball</a></I> has rolled onto 
the Coupe. The question on 
everyone's lips is, can she repeat her 
earlier success? Or will she fail 
miserably, a-tumbling by the roadside 
in pathetic sobbing distress, or what? 
Well strangely enough, that very 
question will be answered in the 
attractively-spaced clumps of words 
that follow. Spook, eh? </b>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You all remember the plot to <I><a href="astroball.htm">Astroball</a></I>. Oh 
come on - you must do. It's about a ball who 
has to bounce around some floating clouds, 
grabbing coins while 
avoiding sharply-edged 
diamond stars. 
And that's it. There's some background wibble 
but it all boils down to springing around with 
skill and gay abandon. "Yes, yes!" I hear you 
cry. "That's as maybe, but what's it actually 
like?" Of course, I can't really hear you say 
that. It's just me being a bit clever and 
attempting to involve you more in the whole 
reviewing experience. Ho hum. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b><I>Seventh heaven, cloud 
nine </I></b><br>
If you cast your critical eye back to issue 78, 
you'll find our noble reviewer (um, me actually) 
wittering on at length about "sweaty-palmed 
action," and "gameplay so addictive it's 
unhealthy," concluding that "the whole thing's 
been put together with loving care and a spot-on attention to detail," before tripping into the 
sunset with the remark, "It's ripping stuff." 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right-ho, that's today's lesson in self-plagiarism. What I'm trying to say, in my coy 
and roundabout fashion, is that Speccy 
<I><a href="astroball.htm">Astroball</a></I> was a corker - and the SAM 
conversion is just the same. It's addictive. By 
Jingo, is it addictlye. By jiggling the ol' 
joystick you exert a wobblingly large 
amount of control over Astroball - 
basically, once she's in the air, you 
can move her about all over the 
place until gravity gets the idea 
and decides to spoil the fun. So,
with a bit of practice, you can 
send the ball into a lazy arc that 
picks up a couple of coins before 
twiddling the joystick minutely to 
drop her safely onto a platform. Or 
maybe not. Y'see, you can only see a 
part of the playing area at one time - the 
vertical scrolling quite successfully hides the 
important bits until you stumble with loud 
screams upon 'em. I love it. I really do. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graphics are slightly better than the 
Speccy's, with dashes of colour and, um, some 
more dashes of colour. Sound is... different - 
there's a fairly horrible title tune, but some 
smashing clangy effects, and a really brilliant 
scream when Astroball drops stomach-wrenchingty through empty space. It all goes to 
create a splendidly spooky atmosphere. Sadly, 
the mini-<I>Galaxians</I> when you complete a level 
has been lost. Actually, the whole thing seems 
dramatically harder this time around - things 
get spectacularly tough from Level Two 
onwards. Tsk. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, so that's a base score of ninety, with 
a couple of extra marks for the sound...  minus 
a few for losing <I>Galaxians</I>... multiply that by 
two... take away the number you first thought 
of - well, blimey. It's a Megagame all over 
again. Hurrah!
