<div>Those 8th Day adventurists are here 
again, with their usual value-for-money package. Apart from a 20-page booklet and the main game in 
its two 128K parts, you get two separate 
playable demo's of forthcoming titles 
(<i>Ardonicus III</i> and <i><a href="weaverofherdreams.htm">The Weaver Of Her Dreams</a></i>) 
and a bonus program, 'How to Play 
Adventure Games.' New players with a 
128K machine start here. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The Raven</i> is the first of a promised series 
of 'Detective Tales', and in this you get a 
chance to play Sherlock Holmes yet again. 
As the latest Infocom game also features a 
Sherlock story, there's obviously life in the 
old 'tec yet. And he's conveniently out of 
copyright, of course! (I wonder, when 
Holmes indulges in his notorious opium 
habit, does that makes him a high tec?) 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This story begins with Holmes at home 
in Baker Street, when the inevitable letter 
arrives. This one's from a Professor Vybes, 
known for his interest in the criminal mind, 
and he's invited Holmes to be present at 
the announcement of a remarkable new 
method for treating the criminally insane 
(though it doesn't specifically mention <i>YS</i> 
readers). The announcement is to take 
place at The Manor, Claxton Grove, on 
Friday at 7 o'clock. The letter's dated 
Wednesday 11, 1893, and is conveniently 
reprinted in the booklet. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The game is played against the clock, and 
you can switch between two time modes 
using FAST and SLOW commands. You'll 
really need to study the booklet as <i>The 
Raven</i> is a pretty complex game. FAST can 
be used when not much is happening, and 
SLOW when things get a bit chaotic, but of 
course you'll have to experiment first to 
discover which is best. The day and time 
are displayed on-screen, and you'll find out 
right at the start how things work, as 
you're in a bookshop just before 6pm on 
Friday. If you wait around too long you see 
the clock tick away, till at six the proprietor 
politely turfs you out and locks the door so 
you can't get back in. But where's that 
cloaked stranger who entered and left the 
bookshop in that short space of time? If 
you follow him he seems to disappear in 
the graveyard. Is this an early glimpse of 
the Raven? 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The game is written with <i>PAW</i> and so the 
parser copes with most things you can 
throw at it, like GET THE BLACK BOMB 
AND OPEN THE MATCHBOX AND GET 
THE MATCH THEN LIGHT THE BOMB 
WITH THE MATCH AND THROW THE 
BOMB AT THE AARDVARK THEN 
QUICKLY RUN WEST. You can, indeed 
must, talk to the other characters in the 
adventure, and the scale of a 128K game is 
shown by the fact that one of these 
characters has 10K set aside just for 
himself. To think that whole adventures 
have been written in less space than that! 
While some adventures just look like it. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You must allow yourself half-an-hour for 
the cab journey to the manor, and if that 
sounds lengthy then bear in mind that it 
doesn't cost you anything! Once there you 
can explore the manor, though be sure not 
to miss the other guests and the meeting 
with Vybes. At the meeting Vybes 
produces Edgar, who he's been 
experimenting on and who he says he has 
cured of his criminal tendencies. He's very 
secretive about his methods - could be a 
case of bad Vybes, if you ask me. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holmes can stay the night at the Manor, 
although a note left in his room warns him 
not to sleep there that night. If he makes a 
rendezvous somewhere creepy at 
midnight, he might learn something about 
one of the other guests. An equally creepy 
meeting the next morning will also help the 
plot to thicken. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The Raven</i> is a game that seems to me 
every bit as complicated as Sherlock, and 
would have been greeted with cries of 
amazement if released at the same time. It 
shows how far Spectrum adventures have 
come in the last year or two, that a game 
as good as this now costs just &pound;5.50 and is 
written on a utility that's available for 
anyone to use. It's far from perfect - some 
of the messages scroll too quickly off the 
screen, there's no RAMSAVE option, 
character interaction is the usual hit-and-miss affair, there are some spelling and 
punctuation mistakes and you can't switch 
the graphics off - as good and as quick as 
they are, sometimes I'd like to play without 
them. I could ignore the faults, however 
<i>Sherlock</i> wasn't exactly perfect, was it? I'll 
stick my neck out and say this is better 
than <i>Sherlock</i> - no 128K adventurer 
should be without it. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>PAW PAUSE</b><br> 
The disk version of <i>PAW</i>'s just arrived from 
Gilsoft, which is great 
news for Plus 3 owners. A quick look at the 
differences between this and the tape 
version reveals that overlays will naturally 
now be loaded in from disk when required, 
either from the master disk or you can 
copy them onto your data disk for ease of 
access. You can't use the Plus 3's RAM drive 
as <i>PAW</i> wants it all for itself. It also wants a 
bit more memory from the system, so it 
takes away Page 7 and 4K from Page 6, but 
it looks to me like you could do most of 
your work on disk and then just switch to 
tape when close to finishing, if you needed 
to regain that extra bit of memory. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The EXTERN command won't work 
with Basic programs when the Plus 3's in 
128K mode, but machine code routines will 
still be okay. You can't use the VERIFY 
command if working from disk, but of 
course you can save to tape and produce 
128K games or 48K games if you like. 
Working on disk yourself will make 
everything so much easier and quicker, but 
there seems to be no option for using the 
spare disk space to produce disk-only 
games that are bigger than 128K. At least, 
not yet!
