I'll start at the very beginning, that's a very good place to start, when you read you begin with A-B-C, when you sing you... ahem, cough, severe blushes... you caught me performing in the bath there. (Oo-er.) I bet you didn't know I wrote the adventure column in the bath as well, did you? It's true, this new underwater +4 is a definite winner. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, on with the show, and I've had 600 letters from <b>Andrew Ryals</b> of Wakefield, who asks if his mate <b>Simon Pudsey</b> can have a small mention. No problem. Simon Pudsey. There, is that small enough? Andrew asks various questions, and I shall give various answers. In <I>Inca Curse</I>, to get out of the sand dungeon you must EPOR ESU. In <I>Planet of Death</I>, the first time you encounter the force field you should ECIWT TI ENIMAXE and then ECNAD. After that you only need to ECNAD to get past. In <I>Ship of Doom</I> you should LRIG EHT LLIK (aww!), shine the torch MAEB EHT TA and, for the hook, TI OT EPOR EHT EIT. Andrew also wants to know if anyone's played an adventure called <I>Village II</I>, which he once got with a tape fanzine. If so, how do you take the ticket from the machine once you've bought it, and what use are the jetpack and lighthouse? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I><a href="venom.htm">Venom</a></I> is another game that's causing problems - no-one yet seems to have solved it! <b>Robin Morris</b> called it "one heck of a sod" (ooh, language!) and wants to know how to get past the snakes and statues and how to kill the Herbal Orb. I'd also like to thank Robin for sending me his tape solution to <I>Ingrid's Back</I>, which he wrote using <I>PAW</I>. See, you can do more than just write adventures with it, you can use it as a menu-driven database too. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Darren Davies</b> of Cardiff complains that he wrote to an adventure-buster from a few issues ago and never received a reply. Did you remember to enclose an sae, Darren? You didn't send me one! But never mind, here are the answers to your <I>Golden Baton</I> questions. The mirror is in MOOR S'DIAM EHT. To kill the gorgon RORRIM DLOH. To get past the crab you need some SGULS DETLAS, and to deal with the padlock on the door REMMAH EHT ESU. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several questions but no sae from <b>Jamie Worrow</b> (naughty Jamie) of Barking. Jamie says he can't get going on <I>Blizzard Pass</I> as every input gets the same response - THAT INPUT CONTAINS NO RECOGNISED WORDS. Since you are getting a response to your input then the machine must be OK - +2 problems tend to be caused by games not loading. I have heard of a few bugged versions of <I>Blizzard Pass</I> in the past, and your first command should be a simple SOUTH. If that gets no response then you'll have to return the game to the shop. They may not be able to replace it, since I assume you got it bundled with the game, so try to get them to swop it for another that works. As for escaping from the Elvenking's Hall in <I><a href="tolkientrilogy.htm">The Hobbit</a></I>, go to the cellar where the answer lies in any empty barrel. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mark Wheeler</b> of Cambridge asks me a question on <I><a href="lancelot.htm">Lancelot</a></I>, and the answer to all problems on Level 9's games is the same. Send off for its official clue sheet. Details in the packaging. Mark also says, "On the +2 text version, can you get pictures, and if so, how?" Ahem, yes, well if you could get pictures it wouldn't be a text version, would it? You'll have to play the graphics version. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>David Jones</b> has an address which I like - Throstle Mount, Luddendenfoot. Neat, yeah? And I even know what a throstle is, so there! I also know how to get across the fissure in <I>Blizzard Pass</I> when throwing the rope doesn't seem to work - EPOR OT GNIR EIT TSRIF. And how to get the raft to move in <I><a href="shadowsofmordor.htm">Shadows Of Mordor</a></I> - TFAR ELOP. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here's someone who doesn't play adventures much, but enjoyed the cover-tape with <I><a href="sixinone.htm">Red Door</a></I> on it - Daniel Wills of Bournemouth. He found out what each of the mummies wants by using his Multiface. But that's cheating! Never mind, all's fair in love, war and solving adventures. For other Multifaced folk, the male mummy info is at address 37717 and the female at 38622. Daniel's got a few more questions, but, by the time he reads this, the solution will have been printed, so there's no point in answering, is there? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last month I mentioned a letter from <b>Captain Nazir Ahmed</b>, and for reasons too lengthy to repeat, I pondered whether or not he was in the Pakistan Intelligence Agency. Nope, it seems he's an airline pilot. See, I have friends in high places. Nazir has been playing a game called <I>Manor Of Doom</I> - though hopefully not while he's flying. He says if anyone has tips or a solution to it, can they let him know? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>David Johnson</b> from Stoke-on-Trent sent me some maps and clues for <I>Corrupt</I>, which I shall file away for future reference. Thanks, David, and there's a freebie available on that game for those who are really stuck. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>James Bramett</b> from Devon asks a very blunt question - "Where the hell can I get adventure games from, as the only one I can find in the shops is <I>Quest For The Golden Eggcup</I>?" I wish there was an equally blunt answer, but there isn't. Most of the budget companies, like Mastertronic, seem to have pulled out of the adventure market, and the best way to get budget stuff is to send off for it, mail order, to the address given in the review. You'll never see some of these games in any of the shops, and they're among the best there are, so don't be put off by the small effort involved in writing a cheque, getting someone to write a cheque for you or simply buying a postal order. For games published by the major companies, like Rainbird, Level 9, Mandarin and so on, browse through the adverts for mail order companies and compare prices. Try to use one that's been recommended, though, as there are one or two fly-by-night merchants buzzing around. Not very many, but the odd one does give mail order buying a bad name. Unfortunately most adventures these days are only available by mail. One of the best services is provided by Official Secrets or Special Reserve, which I've written about in the news section from time to time. Special Reserve only costs &pound;14 and enables you to buy quite a few of the best adventures for about half-price. I've also heard from several readers that their mail order service is very efficient, friendly and quick. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Nikky Smith</b> is also having trouble getting hold of games, especially older titles - these are even harder to find than new ones! The adventure fanzines are a good place to look for second-hand games, or to put in an ad yourself for any you want. The ones Nikky specifically wants are <I>Colour Of Magic, Serf's Tale, <a href="rigelsrevenge.htm">Rigel's Revenge</a></I> and <I><a href="thepawn.htm">The Pawn</a></I>. Contact Nikky if you're prepared to sell or swop. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you're struggling in <I>Bard's Tale</I> then contact Edgar Nugent, Banbridge, Co. Down, N. Ireland. Edgar's mapped a fair part of the game and will send anyone copies of what he's got for 50p (to pay for the photocopying) plus an sae. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another <I>Bard's Tale</I>r is <b>Denis Reily</b> of Northallerton, North Yorks. Denis has finished the game... or thinks he has...he's not quite sure. His reason for doubt is that, at what he thought was the end, the good wizard appeared, said the snow would soon melt, and gave Denis 3,000,000 each of gold pieces and experience points. Now Denis has overcome Mangar four times and is worth (at the last count) 16.8 million pieces of gold! If anyone can tell Denis whether there's a maximum score, and whether the game ever does end, please let him know. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ken Green</b> wants a solution to <I>The Mystery Of Arkham Manor</I>, so if anyone can oblige, bung it in the post. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally a letter from the biggest berk in Berkshire, the one, the only (thank God!) <b>Matthew Conway</b> - whose name, by the way, is an anagram of The Cow-Mat Yawn, whatever that means. Probably more than Cow-Mat's letters usually do! But this time he offers advice on <I><a href="swordsandsorcery.htm">Swords And Sorcery</a></I> in response to a reader's query t'other month. Before you can go to the Accension Hall to complete the game, you need RUOMRA S'BOZ FO SECEIP RUOF EHT. As for the disappearing inventory, this is triggered by trying to carry too many objects. And with that we come to the Strange Case Of The Disappearing Adventure Column...
