The biggie. 
I suppose the question on 
everybody's lips at the 
moment is "Is it as good as the 
original?" and the answer is... no, it's not. 
In fact, I'm afraid to say... it's better! Ha ha! 
Fooled you for a moment there, eh? (Nope? 
Oh well.) </B>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's more to it 
for a start (each 
level is bigger, and 
you can move 
around it as you 
like, rather than 
being forced along 
in one direction), 
there's more variety (lots of platforms and ladders 
and other 'interesting' gameplay elements), 
there're more between-level puzzley bits (and 
they're rather better too) - even the static shooting 
gallery screens are improved. Oh yes, and it's all 
animated and put together in a super-snazzy and 
rather fault-free sort of way too. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>So how does the 
game actually work? </b><br>
Well, the first thing you'll 
notice is how well presented 
it is, with a selection of what 
look like digitised stills from 
the film cropping up along 
the way, and assorted other 
neat touches showing their 
faces too. The second thing 
you'll notice is how well 
thought-out the actual 
gameplay is, but we'll get to 
that in a moment. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike most big licences, 
the Spectrum version of 
<I><a href="robocop.htm">Robocop</a></I> is actually a very 
different game from the 
Amstrad, the C64 or the 16-bit versions (which are, in 
turn, all different from each 
other), let alone the various 
console versions Ocean are 
working on. Apparently this 
is deliberate - some (like the console ones) are 
more straightforward shoot-'em-ups than the 
Speccy game (the thinking being that the average 
Nintendo owner is actually a good deal younger 
than the average Spec-chum). Speccy folk, they 
seem to think, are in their early to mid teens, 
meaning they'll enjoy a bit of mapping and some 
puzzle elements amongst the action - so that's 
what you've been given. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>The First Lump </b><br>
The bulk of <I>Robocop 2</I> is, of course, your scrolling 
shoot-'em-up stuff. The first big chunk of it, set in a 
empty warehouse, is a massive eight-way scroller. 
As before, Robo's walk and movements quite 
neatly capture the clunky look of the big-screen 
character, and he can still fire directly upwards or 
at angles too. Icons drop randomly from the top of 
the screen as he goes - baby food gives extra 
energy, a shield gives temporary invulnerability, 'T' 
gives a three-way firing gun, and 'S' the better 
scatter gun. For each of these you don't need to 
nip across the screen and jump on the icons - 
shooting them will suffice. Be careful though - 
there are also negative icons about that drain 
energy and perform other nasty things, as well as 
a rogue '?' which can do 
anything, sometimes good, 
sometimes bad. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this level, as in the 
other scrolling sections, the 
main difference you'll notice 
from the first game is the
freedom of movement you 
enjoy - you can take any 
route you want around the 
map, and since the playing 
area is two screens high it 
also involves you in a lot of 
platform game-style jumping 
about (made especially 
tricky by the fact that half 
the platforms are actually 
moving conveyor belt 
jobbies!). On top of that, the 
whole thing is actually twice 
the size it initially looks as 
well, since at various points 
you can walk through doors 
in the background wall 
through into a second plane of action, exactly the 
same size as the first (but presented in a different 
colour, so you know where you are). 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>Scratchin'-Your-Head Time </b><br>
Right, once you've completed that it's into the 
puzzle bits. These occur twice in the game 
(between the main levels) and are (sort of) based 
on the early sequences from the film where 
Robocop is trying to regain memories of the man 
he once was. Taking the form of a cursor on a 
circuit board, you have to zoom around collecting 
the loose yellow chips - a task made tricky by the 
fact that you can only travel on the green bits, 
which are disappearing underneath you fast! 
Complete a handful of these boards and your 
scores are added up - do well and you'll earn 
some extra 'continues' for later in the game. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Straight after this comes the shooting range - a 
single-screen affair, but with more targets than its 
opposite number in the first game. With some 
rather pretty spot colour, and a neat 
representation of Robo's targeting device, it's fun 
- and useful too. How well you do here directly 
affects how powerful your bullets are later in 
the game. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>The Second Level </b><br>
Right, moving along, and the second level's pretty 
much the same as the first, though with a different-shaped map and set in a brewery. There are some 
complicated bits (like the fact you have to swing 
over the vats of beer on a sort of overhead hook 
thing) and some very annoying little touches 
thrown in, the worst of which are the drips of 
alchohol which reverse your controls (so when you 
tell Robo to go left he goes right, for instance). 
This only last a few seconds, but can prove fatal - 
either learn to live with it, avoid the drips, or just 
make sure you get hit by an even number, so you'll 
come out the end of it with your controls as they 
should be. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>And The Third... </b><br>
Level Three is much more of a straight shoot-'em-up than the others. It's set in the OCP building. You 
have to work your way along eight floors up to the 
roof, but there's only really one route to take - 
along to the end of one corridor, into a lift, and 
then back along the next one. Ceiling-mounted 
rocket launchers, mini-ED 209s and an assortment 
of thugs get in your way, and occasionally simple 
logic puzzles (ie. Complete the sequence: 56, 28, ?, 
7 - the answer being 14) 
crop up when you want to 
access the lift to each new 
floor. Only at the top do you 
get to enter the back section 
of the screen, where you 
must fight to the death with 
the evil Robo 2, both of you 
crashing through each floor 
as you fight away, eventually 
hitting the street below. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>And that, 
basically, is that... </b><br>
So how does it all add up? 
Well, this is one of the few 
games Ocean have done 
in-house this year (whereas 
last Christmas most of them 
were), and it's by the same 
team who did <I>Operations 
Wolf</I> and <I>Thunderbolt</I>, so, as 
you might expect, it's pretty 
technically faultless. This is 
about as good as Speccy programming gets, with 
some very smooth scrolling, nice animation and 
So on. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gameplay-wise I'd say it's one of the best film 
conversions Ocean have ever done too. I liked <I><a href="theuntouchables.htm">The 
Untouchables</a></I> rather massively last year, but with 
hindsight the gameplay was perhaps a bit too bitty, 
each level (though all shoot-'em-ups) quite short 
and very different from the last. Here the levels are 
massive and retain the same gameplay elements, 
while managing to be quite distinctive at the same 
time. Perhaps a bit more variety between them in 
the backgrounds would have been nice, but then 
that's limited by the look of the film, which seems 
to be 90% set in warehouses anyway. Certainly the 
clever platform sections make it a much more 
interesting game than the first <I><a href="robocop.htm">Robocop</a></I> - in fact, 
they're probably even better than the platform bits 
in <I>Batman The Movie</I>, which I thought had more or 
less set the standard for this sort of stuff. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faults? Well, although I really like this practice 
of putting in smaller sub-games between levels I 
think it's perhaps more of a specialist taste 
whether you want to do little number puzzles right 
in the middle of a shoot-'em-up sequence (like the 
ones on the third level). The game isn't too tied to 
the movie plot either, but 
then that's no great fault - 
I'd much (much) rather have 
a playable game than a 
faithful (but useless) movie 
souvenir anyday, 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is about as good a 
film conversion as I've seen 
indeed, it's about as good 
a shoot-'em-up <I>per se</I> as I've 
seen - and all the better for 
including some mapping 
and puzzle-solving bits 
rather just the straight 
shooting you get with, say, a 
console. There's no real 
point me recommending it 
(you'll all pick it up anyway) 
but, erm, I can't think how to 
end the review if I don't. So, 
erm, I recommend it. You 
won't be shortchanged. It's 
ace. (And I can't say clearer 
than that.) 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<TABLE BORDER><TR><TD>
<center><B><I>ROBO 2</I> - THE MOVIE</b></center><p>
Oh dear. Oh deary deary dear. And just when 
we were writing such nice things about 
Ocean's conversion too. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the opinions of the assembled <I>YS</I> 
reviewing team (ie me and Andy) <I>Robocop II</I> is, 
unfortunately, not a patch on the first film. 
That's not to say it's absolutely terrible - it's 
still quite fun to watch - but the jokes aren't as 
funny, the satire's not as sharp, the action 
sequences aren't as exciting, the effects aren't 
as special, the baddies aren't as bad and 
Robocop seems to lumber around thinking 
he's Dirty Harry half the time. Even his suit 
isn't as nice (it's a horrible shiny blue colour as 
if it's just been polished up in a showroom) and 
he seems to have abandoned his bizarre taste 
for red lippy too. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nope, as with the vast bulk of this year's big 
action films (<I>Die Hard II</I>, <I>Another 48 Hrs</I>, even 
<I><a href="totalrecall.htm">Total Recall</a></I>) <I>Robocop II</I> has its moments but is 
basically a bit of a disappointment. Oh, as I 
said before, dear. 
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
<Center><b>ROBOCOP - THE ORIGINAL GAME</b></center><p>
We've done mini-reviews of this so many times 
recently that I'm loath to write anything else 
about it ever, ever again, especially since most 
of you out there will already own a copy 
anyway. Still, I can't really review <I>Robocop 2</I> 
without at least a brief mention of its mega-successful predecessor, so here it is. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Robocop (1)</I> only got eight out of ten when 
Marcus originally reviewed it (a 'playable, 
efficient but uninspired shooty thing' he called 
it) - a respectable mark to be sure, but hardly 
what you'd expect the biggest-selling etc etc to 
have earned, is it? The game was actually very 
similar in lots of ways to the new one, just 
smaller all round. There was collectable baby 
food to give you energy, more powerful bullets 
to pick up, and, between the scrolling levels, 
puzzle and shooting gallery sub-games to add 
variety - all stuff that reappears in the newie. 
Unfortunately, the bulk of the action was a 
rather samey <I><a href="rollingthunder.htm">Rolling Thunder</a></I>-style warehouse 
shoot-'em-up, the sort of thing we'd seen a 
hundred times before back then, and doubly so 
now, with every other Ocean film conversion 
using exactly the same format. <I>Robo 2</I> hardly 
veers away from the path, of course, but it 
struts its stuff in a rather more interesting 
fashion. (Isn't it nice when the new version of 
something is actually better than the old?)
