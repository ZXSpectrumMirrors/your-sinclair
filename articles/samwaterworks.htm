<div><b>Isn't it amazing to think 
that underneath the cities, 
towns and villages of this 
sceptic isle there are so 
many things happening? 
There are underground caverns and 
pools, secret passages that only the 
government knows about, a 
smattering of nuclear bunkers, gas 
pipes, sewerage pipes, electric cables, 
water pipes and even the odd disused 
aquarium. All this activity goes on 
throughout the day and night while 
we, for the large part, remain 
completely oblivious to it. Amazing, 
eh? Nothing to do with SAM 
<I>Waterworks</I> but, I hope you agree, 
very interesting. </b>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waterworks, which is what 
l <I>should</I> be telling you about, 
is a bit like Backgammon in 
the sense that it's one of 
those games that you have 
to play to understand. If 
somebody tries to explain it 
to you, you just end up 
bemused, bothered and bewildered. The thing 
to do is jump straight in at the deep end and, 
erm, ask somebody who's played before what 
you should do when you get stuck! Okay, let's 
load it up... 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right... it wants a password, I haven't got 
any passwords. Aagh! Jonathan! It wants a 
password and I don't know any. What shall I 
do? <I>(Just press RETURN and you'll be okay, 
after that it'll tell you the level password 
whenever you start a new level. If you write 
them down, you can go straight to any level 
when you start another game. Jonathan)</I> Ah, I 
see. Right, RETURN it is then! 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now it all looks a bit complicated so maybe I 
should read the instructions... Okay, as far as I 
can tell, the idea is to get through lots of 
screens opening doors, drowning aliens and, 
this is the tough bit, 
adjusting the water level. 
Y'see, some bits of the 
screen and particular 
doors only become 
accessible when the 
water level has risen, or 
dropped, to a certain 
height. To adjust the 
water level you have to 
open different nozzles 
and turn switches on 
and off and also lay 
some pipes. Oh, and 
there are spikes and a 
submarine as well. 
That's the theory bit over, 
let's get back to the 
game and try out this 
new-found knowledge. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first level is quite 
easy, as all you have to   
do is move the pieces of 
pipe around to form one long connecting 
pipeline. This is a common occurence 
throughout <I>Waterworks</I> and will probably 
mean lots of comparisons with <I>Pipemania</I>. Ah, 
the second level... Blimey, what am I meant to 
do here? Jonathan! What's happening here? 
<I>(You're going to have to pick up that key, to 
open that door up there. Now, by turning 
switches on and off you open other doors 
which let the water come flowing 
through. This could be a good thing or 
a bad thing. At the moment you don't 
want any water coming in and you've 
 got a choice of three switches. Click 
on one of them... Ah, that was the 
wrong one to click on. You've 
drowned the whole screen. Start 
again. Jonathan)</I> Oh well, at least I'll 
know which one not to switch on 
next time.

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Playing <I>Waterworks</I> involves logical 
thinking, the process of elimination 
and a lot of trial and error. I know 
I've probably made it all sound 
horrendously difficult, but it isn't 
everything's that bad. The graphics are nice and 
big and everything is cunningly, 
and usefully, colour-coded. So the 
bits of pipes you can move are red 
and the ones that stay put are blue, likewise all 
the different switches and taps are easily 
recognisable (unless you've got a black 
and white telly, when it does get a tad more 
confusing). Another thing in its favour is the 
fact that it's so easy to control, even if you 
don't know what nozzle to open! According 
to FRED Publishing, this isn't a puzzle game 
but a kind of three in one puzzle-arcade-strategy game. Hmmm, I think <I>Waterworks</I> 
can go on the 'puzzlies' shelf myself. The 
aliens do seem to be a desperate attempt to 
include an arcade element but, seeing as 
they move in set patterns, you've just got to 
try and remember those patterns, which 
sounds a bit like an IQ puzzle to me! Now I 
like puzzle games and I'm sure another one 
won't do much harm. <I>(But we've got loads of 
blimmin' puzzle games! We want shoot-'em-ups, we want blood, we want violence! A 
multitude of SAM owners)</I> Okay, if you've had 
enough of SAM puzzlers then this could be the 
last straw, which would be a shame cos it's a 
nice little game. I'd buy it. If I had ten quid.
