Bug Off! That's my message this month, to adventure houses who continually release adventures with bugs in them. And not just minor ones, some of them cause the game to crash and/or prevent you finishing it. Latest report is yet another bugged game from CRL, who is neck and neck with Mastertronic in the bug-ridden stakes. <b>Tony Armitage</b> of Liverpool tells me that he's got as far as the third part of <I>Jack The Ripper</I>, only to discover that the game crashes if you try to go east from the crossroads. Tony says that as far as he knows, you <I>must</I> go east from the crossroads at some stage in order to finish the game, and when he phoned CRL to complain about it he was told that a corrected version would be produced soon. I should hope so too! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Haven't these software houses realised that it's a false economy to skimp on play-testing adventures? They get themselves landed with extra costs for having to withdraw the game and duplicate new copies, when I'm sure there are plenty of adventure players out there who'd be delighted to help with play-testing new games in return for a free copy. One aspect seems to be the pressure that software houses put on the programmers to get the games out as soon as possible. To me this seems ludicrous. I'd rather wait an extra week or so for a guaranteed perfect adventure, and in any case most people don't rush out and buy the latest game the day it's realeased, do they? Or do they? Let me know what you think the priorities should be. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right, now that's off my chest I can get on with the show, starting with that strange personage who refuses to reveal his name and just calls himself the <b>Abertillery Anagram</b>. Must have a funny name, that's all I can say, probably something like Barnaby Cuddlebum. Anyway, he's a semi-Kind Soul at heart as he's got some of the answers to a recent Lost Soul's questions, but he couldn't be bothered to write to them direct. So, for Satish who was stuck in <I><a href="megabucks.htm">Megabucks</a></I> to get into the pub you should look around for a number written on a wall, then dial it and see what happens. Also from the Anagram, some tips on <I>Doomdar's Revenge</I>: objects like crowns, spells and runes are a help but not vital; go to the towers to get advice; unlike <I><a href="ystop100_4.htm">Lords Of Midnight</a></I> there is a never-ending supply of warriors in the cities, so try to keep your strength up to about 1200 men each; finally, don't keep similar groups together as they may rebel and !*@! off. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also helpful to Lost Souls but also too tight-fisted to spend 13p on a stamp and write to them direct is Conway The Barbarian, otherwise known as the <b>Berk From Berkshire</b>. In <I>Sinbad</I>, to defeat the dragon: EXA HTIW GNOG TIH and then EXA HTIW NIAHC TIH. In <I>Matt Lucas</I>, once you've got yourself a weapon you can GUHT TOOHS, and when you've done that don't forget what you were told about his leg. In <I>Eureka - Carribean</I>, follow the plane down the runway and then NI PMUJ TSUJ. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking of Conway (must we?), his last letter to me (at least I hope it's his last) says that MENSA doesn't stand for Morons, Egg-Heads, Nerds and Smart-Arses as I suggested the other month. Instead, he says, it's Latin for table. Table? Now who on earth would want to join an organisation called table? Sofa, yes, and bedside cabinet maybe, but table? More to the point, what does TABLE stand for? Twits And Boring Little 'Erberts? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More helpful by far than the likes of Conway is <b>James Magee</b> of Glasgow who deserves a special mention and a pat on the back for sending me solutions and maps to umpteen (and I counted them), adventures that he's solved. I didn't know they made envelopes that big. Thanks, James, and consider your back patted. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Shane Wood</b> asks how to pass tile door in Zone 3 of <I><a href="timeandmagik.htm">Lords Of Time</a></I>. to which my answer is 'Which door?' To one of them you AKERUE YAS and to t'other one TTAW SEMAJ YAS. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now two messages this month in my mailbox from readers of the adventure pages of Micronet. Who also both quite sensibly read <I>Your Sinclair</I>. <b>Sue Medley</b> sends help to a Lost Soul who was stuck in <I>White Door</I>/<I><a href="sixinone.htm">Crisis At Christmas</a></I> the advice being that the battery for the torch is in the larder north of the kitchen, and once you've got the batteries you should find the missing presents, as they're both in dark areas at the top and bottom of the house. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also Micronettin' of an evening is <b>Paul Hercberg</b>. who uses the speed of e-mail to put ill his claim to be "the first Spectrum-Owning, <I>Your Sinclair</I>-reading adventure player to finish <I><a href="gnomeranger.htm">Gnome Ranger</a></I> with help from my friend, Chris Nettieship." I think Paul's claim stands up in court, and he also asks if I play <I>Shades</I> (a multi-user adventure available on Micronet), and if so why don't I tell YS readers about it and give tips? Well, I don't play <I>Shades</I> 'cos I don't like multi-user games (not to mention huge phone bills), but if anyone wants to write in and tell other readers what they're missing then I'll be happy to set aside a bit of shady space somewhere. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not yet finished in <I><a href="gnomeranger.htm">Gnome Ranger</a></I> is <b>Malcolm Austin</b> from Brainford, but he sends in some tips for what he's done so far. In the eagle's nest: SKCIHC TIH then LLEB TEG. To get out of the marsh where the fog is you must ELGAE WOLLOF (in fact you can do this with other characters too). To talk to the nymph: REWOLF EVIG. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To <b>Pauline King</b> of Rainham in Kent. All I can say is that if you write in again and enclose sae with your <I>full</I> address on it, I might be able to help - tell me if you're still stuck in the same places. And <b>Pete Whitby</b> of Bristol - send sae for a mini-freebie. Don't forget, folks and folkesses, that you must enclose sae if you want a reply - if you don't, I'll try to answer your questions in these pages but even so there still isn't room to deal with them all and you'll have quite a wait before it appears. So sae is your best bet. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Paul Lennox</b> from Ayrshire didn't enclose sae, but then he wasn't asking for a reply, just sending me a solution to <I><a href="rigelsrevenge.htm">Rigel's Revenge</a></I>. What a kind McChap. Ta, Paul. A few notes from Paul wouldn't go amiss on this tricky adventure either, such as the info that among the red herrings in part two are: YHGNID, HCTAP and LANAC FO KNAB REHTO NO ELCYCTEJ. In part one the objects in the bungalow are: SGNIRREH DER. When you find the file of uniforms outside the bungalow you must MROFINU NAILLEGIR TEG. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Darren Martin</b> of Hounslow asks how to get out of the manager's office in <I>Play It Again, Sam</I>. The answer is to use the unusual command of CUT BONDS BLADE, which I won't write backwards as it's hard enough to figure it out forwards. <b>Peter Robinson</b> from Grimsby wants to know what to do after the Post Office job in <I><a href="bugsy.htm">Bugsy</a></I>. Howard Jones (not THE Howard Jones?) from Shropshire asks where and how do you get the nails in <I>The Shrewsbury Key</I>. This could be a mite tricky as there aren't any nails in <I>The Shrewsbury Key</I>. If you're trying to build a boat of some kind, you don't use nails with the planks, you DROC ESU. Then you just TAOB EKAM. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ted Fielder</b> of Middlesex wonders what to do after beating the penguin in <I>The Mural</I>, the answer to which is SEMIT DAER and then type TUO NOPUOC. To kill the mole in <I>Project X</I> requires: NOTTUB DNA ELDEEN. Ted also wonders if anyone else has had trouble with the program crashing in <I>Out Of The Shadows</I>? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A simple question from the <b>Whitseys</b> of Northampton: "What and where are the treasures in <I>Serf's Tale</I>?" What??? Come on, there are 17 of them in all, you must be able to find something of value somewhere? And if you think I'm listing them all then you must be joking - well: at a later date, maybe, as this one (like a certain other Smart Egg game) is causing quite a few problems. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the Adventurers Club will have spotted that YS reader <b>Allan Phillips</b> has just shot into first place in their Adventurers Credits Chart, and therefore stands to win fifty quid for having sent in most solutions to the club. This means he can afford to buy me another drink. Allan has sent me a solution to <I>Excalibur</I>, amongst others, and says that one was so easy that his cat could have done it. In fact judging by the state of Allan's map, the cat's definitely done something! Allan says he solved it in 1 hour 15 minutes, and with only one saved game position, which is not a recommendation even for an adventure that only costs &pound;1.99. I think my own fastest time for solving a game was about two hours for <I>Circus</I> but can any readers claim a faster solution to any game than Allan's 75 minutes?
