<p> <font size=4><b> GRASS CUTTINGS</b></font><br> My spies in the Amstrad (hiss) CPC camp came up with this cutting. Somebody somewhere is telling megaporkies - I think we should be told... <p><center><a href="../thumbs/letters/big/34a.jpg"><IMG SRC="../thumbs/letters/34a.jpg"></a></center><p> <br> <b> Nick Cheesman <br> Borden, Hants <br> </b> <br><i> So do I. Will the culprit please come forward and explain. <b>Ed</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> GARDENER'S WORLD</b></font><br> We would like this opportunity to inform your readers of the Australian version of <i><a href="advancedlownmowersimulation.htm">Advanced Lawnmower Simulator</a></i>, as reviewed in the April issue of <i>YS</i>. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are calling it <i>Flymo Action</i> as ours is an electric version and we are confident that it'll live up to the high standards already set in this demanding form of computer game. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the features will include variable cord length, international voltage setting e.g. 110 volts, 240 volts etc. And a random lawn generator. We will also be supplying expansion modules of various lawn types and climates. The 128K version will include a random weather generator which unfortunately cannot be squeezed into the 48K version. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an incentive we will also be including, free of charge to the first 100 orders, a 20 foot extension cord. <br> <b> J J Ball, Manager <br> Gardensoft, Australia <br> </b> <br><i> Sounds like a bargain too good to miss. I hereby place the first hundred orders. Give the games to a charity and send me a 2000 foot extension cord. <b>Ed</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> NEW GROWTH</b></font><br> After following the Gardensoft saga for many months I have decided to put pen to paper. I am the Managing Director of the rival company to Gardensoft, Loungesoft. Our many releases include <i>Professional Sofa Simulator, Advanced TV Simulator</i> (with free remote control) and <i>Stereo Simulator</i> (CD or vinyl disk versions). We are also opening a new sister company called Bedroomsoft but we haven't got any of our games past the Board Of Censors yet. After seeing all the trouble IJL Griffiths had I would like to ask him whether he would be interested in becoming an in-house programmer for us? We are a very long established company offering excellent pay and I would be grateful if IJL Griffiths could contact us via <i>YS</i>. <br> <b> CJ Cox, Loungesoft <br> Games <br> Beckenham, Kent <br> </b> <br><i> You could be having a few copyright problems yourself with the </i>Professional Sofa Simulator<i>, as Gardensoft released a </i>Chaise Longue Simulator<i> in May, on their budget label, Grass Box. <b>Ed</b>. </i> <p> <font size=4><b> SUPERGRASS</b></font><br> It's true. I became very friendly with the director of Gardensoft and I'm going to sell my story to the <i>News Of The World</i> and <i>The Sun</i>. Though for the price of one <i>YS</i> badge you can have an exclusive. Okay here it is: 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ronnie babes (oops) and myself were having a little drink and he asked me round to his flat to show me something. When we got there he showed me the pilot copy of <i><a href="advancedlownmowersimulation.htm">Advanced Lawnmower Simulator</a></i>. At that point the incredible synthesised speech and brilliant logo told me that it was non other than <i>Qualcast Roto-mo</i> by IJL Griffiths. Ronnie told me all about his scandalous plan to change the title and gain copyright and begged me not to tell anybody. I am therefore prepared to testify that IJL Griffiths is the sole owner of this game. <br> <b> Bimbo Baby (alias John <br> Hunt) <br> A Secluded Villa In Spain <br> </b> <br><i> It's a deal. You get one </i>YS<i> badge, I get the exclusive. Not a very good businessman, are you? You could probably have got 10 to 12 thousand pounds from </i>The News of The World<i>. <b>Ed</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> LITTLE STINKERS</b></font><br> I have a tip for <i>Program Pitstoppers</i>. Was there ever a time when you had to go to the toilet/answer the phone in the middle of typing in a really long program only to return to find your little brother/sister had NEWed the program on you? Well, I have the answer. Just type in RANDOMIZE USR 1302. This imitates something loading into the Speccy so you can pretend you are loading a game for them. <br> <b> Stephen Gallagher <br> Co. Kildare, Eire <br> </b> <br><i> Do you have something that'll stop Phil eating my sandwiches when I nip off to make a cuppa? <b>Ed</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> TAKE THAT</b></font><br> I want to take you to task over your Megagame Previews. How on earth can you possibly know a game that hasn't been released and therefore hasn't been finished is a Megagame? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the <i><a href="outrun.htm">OutRun</a></i> debacle where you did a Megagame Preview on it and then gave it an 8 in a later review. I hope you have learned your lesson. <br> <b> Chris Mileham <br> London <br> </b> <br><i> Now let's get this straight! We have never ever given an unfinished game a rating. All unfinished products are previewed - those that we feel are likely to be good quality, chart topping games (like </i><a href="outrun.htm">OutRun</a><i>) are often given a Megapreview. Although we called the </i><a href="outrun.htm">OutRun</a><i> piece a Megagame Preview that was a mistake it should have read Megapreview. You'll notice we didn't rate it because it was not complete. We later go on to review these products when they are ready to go on sale. They may well be rated as megagames or if we don't think they're good enough they won't. We do this to ensure that </i>YS<i> readers always get a fair deal - every game we review is the product you'll be getting if you buy it, not a demo or screen or incomplete product. Okay? <b>Ed</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> BRAINSTORM</b></font><br> Please load this tape with either LOAD "" or 128K Tapeloader. Please note it isn't meant to be nasty, just satirical. <p><center><a href="../thumbs/letters/big/34b.jpg"><IMG SRC="../thumbs/letters/34b.jpg"></a></center><p> <br> <b> Dean Ashton <br> Scarborough, N. Yorks <br> </b> <br><i> I get the message! All I can say is I apologise profusely for the delay in staging the </i>YS<i>/US Gold Golden Brain Awards. If you can remain patient for a little while longer we will be sending you details of where and when it will be held. <b>Ed</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> FEELING LISTLESS?</b></font><br> Oh dear what ever has happened to your magazine? I used to get <i>YS</i> in the early 80's <i>(Groovy baby! Ed)</i> because it was full of listings and cheap. What we have now is a glossy magazine full of adverts, reviews, tips, previews, hints and POKEs. I've just got myself a 128K and would dearly like to see some listings again. I see that even <i>SU</i> don't do listings anymore. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that costs have gone up but there must be someone ready to publish their work for others to enjoy. <br> <b> JG Gibson <br> Penzance, Cornwall <br> </b> <br><i> I wonder about some of you lot sometimes. Surely it hasn't escaped your notice that we're the only Spectrum magazine that runs three pages of your programs every month? If you keep sending your routines in we'll keep printing them. <b>Ed</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> MMM LOVELY!</b></font><br> On the whole I'd rather be in PHILADELPHIA. <br> <b> Lorenzo The Unlucky <br> Woodchuck <br> Plymouth, Devon <br> </b> <br><i> On the whole I'd rather be anywhere but here!

In the March edition of your wonderful magazine on page 22 it says that Meatloaf wrote, 'You give lunch a bad name'. Although Meatloaf are a brilliant band they didn't write that, but they did write and sing 'You give love a bad name'. <br> <b> Richard Peters <br> Portshead, Avon <br> </b> <br><i> Talk about meat head! I think you got the wrong end of the cleaver. The chart was about songs with the word love in replaced with lunch. Oh never mind - here's a Trainspotter Award to keep you quiet. <b>Ed</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> WELL DICEY</b></font><br> The number of spots on opposite sides of a dice add up to seven. Your dice in the <i>Guild Of Thieves</i> review had the six and one next to each other.

I used to buy <i>Crash</i> until one day I saw <i>Your Sinclair</i> and at last there was happiness in my life. That's all! <br> <b> Tony Allen <br> Londonderry, Northern <br> Ireland <br> </b> <br><i> <p><center><a href="../thumbs/letters/big/34c.jpg"><IMG SRC="../thumbs/letters/34c.jpg"></a></center><p> It's more fun than a beaten up old teddy! <b>Ed</b> </i> <p> <TABLE align=center BORDER BGCOLOR=white BACKGROUND=""><TR><TD> <FONT SIZE=6><B><U>STAR LETTER</U></b></font><br><font size=4><b> DOUBLE CROSSER</b></font><br> Do you really want to know? Yes, that's right, I'm going to spill the beans on my best friend Rob Moorman. Doubtless he'll pummel my head into the ground but I like the look of those <i>YS</i> badges. Oh in case you don't know what I'm on about look in issue 32, page 16. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rob after sealing his relationship with Lisa and the hedgehogs has now moved on to pastures new. He's now after a female sixth former called Siobhan (wahay) Lavelle. One day when she was on lunch duty he had lunch five times so he could walk past her. He follows her around in a daze and spends a fortune on roses on Valentine's Day. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Err, hi Rob. THUD!!! Quick get me a straightjacket, get me a doctor. YIKES!!! <br> <b> S Westaway <br> Ward 15, Visiting times <br> 3-5pm <br> </b> <br><i> Some kind of friend you are! Poor old Rob sounds like he's quite a romantic chap - I wish someone would send </i>me<i> roses (hint, hint). I only hope that Siobhan will notice him soon.

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the spots, scarf and boils on the neck have set in, there'll be no saving him from a fate worse than Casey Jones beefburgers. <b>Ed</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> SHE DEVIL</b></font><br> I hereby serve warning to all male members of the <i>YS</i> staff that Teresa Maughan, when rearranged becomes: UG!

A man so evil that he organised a day trip to the Nene Valley Railway for the whole of a junior and infant school. Who is this vile creature? He is none other than Peter Waszack <i>(Who? Ed)</i>, the school librarian of St John Fisher school in Peterborough. The sadistic man even had a book published about trains! How evil can you get? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I dare not take a photo of him because if he found out I may be forced to stand alongside him watching those Intercity 125's pass by. Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrggghhh! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can assure you he looks the part though with those infamous NHS specs, the bogey green cardigan and the quarter to three walk.

It may not have dawned on them that the stars of these two games are women - that's what women have got to do with computers. I mean, what has a topless bimbo got to do with the news?! But does that stop <i>The Sun</i> and does anyone write outraged letters to Rupert Murdoch? Nope! Tara. <br> <b> Gavin Thomas <br> Ebbw Vale, Gwent <br> </b> PS It's a great mag and I'm an Amstrad owner! <br> <br><i> I entirely agree with your point about Page Three bimbos being shown in rags like </i>The Sun, News Of The World<i> and </i>Sunday Sport<i>.

It's now too late but I would really do anything for a signed photo of Corrine Russell (<i><a href="vixen.htm">Vixen</a></i> girl). I would pay a stack of money or give you anything you want for a poster or photo of the lovely girl - I've been a fan of hers for years ever since she was a dancer on the Kenny Everett show. I'm 15 and may be suicidal if I don't get in touch with her somehow.
