Hello, ello, ello, what's all this then? A letter in the mailbag headed 'METROPOLITAN POLICE'? Yikes, they must have found the photos... what photos? Sorry officer; I never mentioned photos, who said anything about polaroid photos? Not me. Let's look again... yup, definitely says Metropolitan Police, 'No, 728 (Unruled)'. So who is this person wanting me to assist him with his enquiries into Dungeons, and threatening that if I don't he'll 'send the boys round?' Maybe I'd better keep his name an official secret or he might get in trouble for stealing police property, or maybe playing adventure games while on duty (so that was why they installed the police computer!). 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what I said to this copper from somewhere in Surrey, is what I say to all people who write in and ask me questions on Level 9 adventures, which is to write directly to Level 9 itself, including an sae and the coupon included with all its games, so you can get yourself an official and very helpful help sheet. This isn't laziness on my part, and is of course nothing to do with the fact that I couldn't find my own help sheet for <I><a href="jewelsofdarkness.htm">Dungeon Adventure</a></I>, but is because anyone who has a legitimate copy of a Level 9 adventure can get a free help sheet for themselves. As we all know, there are lots of pirated copies of games floating about, and neither myself nor Level 9 like to encourage the illegal copying of games by enabling people to get help when they haven't bought the game in the first place. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enough of this seriousness though, let's get silly and what could be sillier than <b>Andy Lowe</b> of Zodiac Software? <b>Dave Dutton</b> of Zodiac Software maybe? But anyway, it's Andy who's written in and said I might be interested in Zodiac's Top Five Silly Names Of People Who Have Written In And Bought Its Adventures Through The Recent Special Offer? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.	<b>P. Belcher</b> (Still at No. One!) 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Primoz Ferkulj</b> 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>John Leech</b> 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>A.M. Speed</b> 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>David Smith</b> 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of those names are hardly silly at all, but it's a good way to lose yourself five customers in one go! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next is a letter from someone with an even sillier name <b>David McCandless</b>. You can't fool me, I know you make these names up just to give me a laugh... but I can't help feeling this particular name is strangely familiar from somewhere... but where? Wherever it is, David says he's caught the adventure game bug 'after years of vapourising aliens and decades of sweaty joysticks'. And now he's got some tips to pass on to YS readers. In <I><a href="mindfighter.htm">Mindfighter</a></I>, you should LYRAD OT MROTSWONS EVIG. To find a copper key SBEWBOC KAERB (on the downstairs floor of the house). When you're near the clock tower, to find some useful objects: ELBBUR ENIMAXE. On July 3rd YTTEJ OT OG where Yabushi will appear with his Samurai Sword. This is the best weapon to have, and if you can't get it then TI YRRAC NAC TREBOR. David's tip in the first part of <I>Knight Orc</I> is that if you don't want any of your treasure or objects stolen then put them at the bottom of the well and EPOR EITNU so that no-one can get at them. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Malcolm Jardine</b> writes from Girvan, Ayrshire to say that he's just completed his first adventure, <I><a href="jadestone.htm">The Jade Stone</a></I>, which took him two solid days, and he's willing to help anyone out on that. However; he's still stuck in <I>Hammer Of Grimmold</I> and <I>Labours Of Hercules</I>. Now what makes me think Macolm's been taking advantage of my 'Best Indies' offers? Anyway, in the first one he wants to know how to deal with the sleeping Orc. This has proved to be one of those problems that ought to be no problem at all, yet I've had several letters asking about it. The fact that the Orc is sleeping is the nicely misleading statement, as all you need to do is DROWS HTIW MIH LLIK. In <I>Hercules</I> Malcolm asks what's the secret of getting through the Marsh of Lerna? No secret as far as I know, the only way through is to map it. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A quick thanks to <b>Wren Bull</b> of Carmarthen for sending in various solutions, including <I>Pete Bog</I> from Infected Software which he says he 'spent a pleasant couple of hours solving.' Wren's also just finished <I>The Jade Necklace</I>, and he warns other readers of what held him up near the end - after using two-word input for most of the adventure you're suddenly required to type in four words, and Wrens brain couldn't take the strain! Too many of those banking exams he's been taking. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And another quick thanks, this time from <b>Matthew 'Wehttam' Conway</b> of Berkshire to the anonymous reader from Peterborough who kindly sent him a map to <I><a href="ystop100_4.htm">Lords Of Midnight</a></I> but didn't enclose a name or address. And thanks too to all the other YS readers who helped. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now a quick plea, from <b>Ted Webb</b>, Waterlooville, Hants. Ted's trying to get hold of the two Delta 4 'Joystick' games, so can anyone help? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Colin Joyce</b> has a query about the <I>Quill</I> POKE that appeared back in the March issue. Unfortunately I don't have the POKEr's address, so if Richard Alexander is reading this, maybe he could contact Colin Craigavon, Co Amargh. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Linda XX Wyse</b> (well that's how she signs herself) of Bo'ness asks why there isn't a new photo of me on the adventure pages? Please, don't make me have my photo taken again. You should see the extra wrinkles since I started dealing with you lot. Lynda's other questions, which are definitely easier to deal with, concern <I>St Brides</I> and <I><a href="mastersoftheuniverse.htm">Masters Of The Universe</a></I>. In the first, what does she do after getting locked up when leaving the room wearing the dress? TNIAF OT DNETERP. In the second, how to get the second Timelink from Mantanna's cave? SETIMGALATS ENIMAXE DNA DROWS HTIW ANNATNAM LLIK. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>P. J. Edensor</b> of Rugeley asks for some dues on <I>Blizzard's Pass</I>. The best thing you can do is send me a stamped addressed envelope for a freebie on that game, and this is a reminder to everyone who writes in that if you send an sae then you'll get a reply, but if you don't... You might get your query answered inprint, but there isn't room to answer everyone and you'll also have to wait at least a month, maybe more, before it appears. So there! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>William Snowden</b> of Cheshire is stuck in <I><a href="jinxter.htm">Jinxter</a></I>, and says he just cannot figure out how to get the saddle across to the station to saddle the unicorn. He says every time he tries to get it across by sitting on the cloud, 'the stupid cloud chucks the saddle out of my possession. I have tried carrying nothing but the saddle and the pelican charm, but this doesn't seem to work either! Please put me out of my misery soon!' The answer to this problem is one of those delightful solutions that make adventure games worth playing... once you know it, that is. You don't take the saddle that way to the station: TI GNITSOP YRT. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lots of readers have been mis-led by my tip on <I><a href="gnomeranger.htm">Gnome Ranger</a></I>, that said the object to get from the shop was the spade, which was useful for digging at the end of the rainbow. Six million people (well, almost) have written in to say that they've done that and nothing happens. And I've written back six million times (well, almost) to point out that I didn't say it was Ingrid who did the digging. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One Scottish reader wrote in with a poetic plea, and says that if I publish her letter please refer to her as the <b>Aberdonian Adventurer</b>, as she's rather shy! With three kisses on the bottom (so to speak)? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another female reader is <b>Jillian Squiggly-Signature</b> of Torquay, who didn't send me any kisses but lots of questions on <I>The NeverEnding Story</I>. The answers to these are quite complicated, even if I print them forwards, so again the solution is to send me an sae for a freebie. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Bill Campbell</b> from Ireland asks about <I>Castle Blackstar</I>, and wants to know how to get past the skeleton (ENORHT HSUP DNA TI ENIMAXE) and how to get the sword out of the stone (ERTPECS DNA NWORC GNIRAEW FI TI LLUP). 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also from Ireland is <b>Fintan Ward</b>. Fintan complains that my <I><a href="rigelsrevenge.htm">Rigel's Revenge</a></I> hint-sheet was pretty bad as it only explained how to get out of the flat. Thanks for the tips on the rest of the game, Fintan, but I did say when I offered it that my mini-freebie was only meant to tell you how to get out of the flat! The things I have to put up with, honestly, I mean, am I appreciated, mumble-mumble, rant, rave... Okay I'll come quietly officer...
