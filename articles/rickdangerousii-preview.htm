<div><b>Rick Dangerous, eh? What a guy! 
Last year he dodged boulders, 
leapt impossible gaps and tussled 
with pigmies (amongst other 
equally risky things). This time 
round he's sneaking aboard alien 
space ships, wrestling polar 
bears, and bounding up rather 
tall trees. 'I'd rather stay at home 
and watch <I>Baywatch</I> actually,' 
says MATT BIELBY... </b>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Picture the scene: there we all were on 
the grass outside the <I>YS</I> shed, trying to 
make some choices for the <I>Games Of The 
Year '89</I> award thingies. As you might 
expect a lot of people plumped for the 
obvious (<I>Chase HQ, Carrier Command</I> 
and the like) but every so often a really 
simple looking, unpretentious little game 
would get mentioned. It wasn't a big 
arcade or film licence, it didn't push 
forward any great technical boundaries, 
to be honest it hadn't really attracted that 
much attention at all when it first came 
out. But somehow it'd still managed to 
make a surprisingly large impression, and it 
soon became crystal clear why that was. 
And why? Well, simply that everyone 
found it dead playable, of course! It didn't 
win any awards (either from us or 
elsewhere, if I remember) but nobody had 
a bad word to say about it. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That game (as you should have guessed 
by now if you're 
not ultra-thick) 
was the first <I><a href="rickdangerous.htm">Rick 
Dangerous</a></I>, and a 
right little corker it 
was too. At the 
time ( mid '89 I guess) it was 
mega-gigantic things like <I>Carrier 
Command, Times Of Lore</I> and <I>Total 
Eclipse II</I> that were making all the 
headlines, so when little <I>Rick</I> - 
something you didn't need a 124 
page manual to play! - came along 
it was like a breath of fresh air. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, I lied a bit a back there. 
People did have a bad thing to say 
about <I>Rick</I> - just one - and that's 
that they found it a little bit too hard. Just 
because a game is easy to get into 
doesn't mean it can't be incredibly tricky, 
and <i>Rick</I> is a case in point. MicroStyle 
actually brought out a special 'easier' 
edition of it fairly recently for all those 
people that never got past level two - an 
almost unprecedented step. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But anyway; the new <I><a href="rickdangerous.htm">Rick Dangerous</a></I> 
game. Those who completed the first one 
(ie. About three people probably) will 
know that the end of <I>Rick (1)</I> rather neatly 
sets the scene for <I>Rick (2)</I> - yep, they 
apparently planned for a sequel that early 
on! His first adventure completed, Rick is 
entertaining a lady friend in a restaurant in 
Hyde Park when - yikes! - a giant alien 
space ship plops down right next to them! 
Everybody else runs away (of course) but 
(Rick being Rick) our hero legs it in the 
opposite direction - straight up inside the 
alien ship! - thus paving the way for this 
newie. Yes, you guessed it, it's Rick in 
space! 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>Blimey! But wasn't Rick meant to be a 
jungle hero (just like Indiana Jones)?</b><br> 
Well yes, and then again, no. As you so 
cleverly deduced, <I>Rick (1)</I> was (ahem) 
'heavily influenced' by 
the Indiana Jones films 
(and the various jungle 
adventures that came 
before it). However 
Rick himself wasn't 
really conceived as an 
Indiana Jones type 
only - he was more 
your universal hero, 
who could (in sequels) 
look and act like any 
traditional adventurer 
the programmers 
fancied. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus <I>Rick (2)</I> leans 
heavily on another 
series of classic cliff hangers - those '30s 
<I><a href="flashgordon.htm">Flash Gordon</a></I> serials with Buster Crabbe 
and oodles of gothic space ships with 
sparklers sticking out the back. The levels 
in this new <I>Rick</I> are all pastiches of the 
environments from those films - the ice 
planet, the forest world, the mud mines 
(from <I>Buck Rogers</I> this one, but never 
mind) and (of course) Emperor Ming's 
Palace. (Doing the research must've been 
fun at least.) 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>Let's see how it all works shall we? </b><br>
In game design <I>Rick 2</I> is pretty identical to 
the first one. There are five levels this time 
(not four) but the flip screen horizontally/push scrolling vertically way of working 
and the slab side viewpoint remain the 
same. It's very colourful, with cute, squat 
little sprites and gameplay that more or 
less equally combines bits that require 
sheer game playing skill with sections 
where a bit of clever thinking is required. 
Actually I think I'll stress that 
colourful bit again (I 
skipped over it a bit back 
there). This is actually 
one of the most 
visually attractive 
platform and ladders 
games of recent times, 
packed with colour 
(but very little clash) 
and plenty of visual 
variety. Though the 
levels feature 
much the same 
sort of gameplay, 
they each have a 
very different 
atmosphere and 
feel. I won't stress it 
any further, but if 
you thought the 
first <I>Rick</I> was pretty 
(and it was) then 
check this one out. 
The other main 
improvement 
should (though I 
can't vouch for it 
yet) be that the 
game has a rather 
easier learning 
curve. Instead of 
bunglng you 
straight into things 
(though the lazer-bolt packed opening 
screen is similar to the 'leg it!' start of the 
first game) it tones things down a bit for 
the first level. Though it gets very hairy later 
on, this first section should give most 
gamesplayers few real problems - it's 
almost set up to show you how things work 
and get you into the feel of the game. 
I'll explain what I mean further as we take 
a look at the individual levels. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>Level One - The Alien Mothership </b><br>
A-ha! The very 
'learning' level I was 
going on about a 
minute ago, though 
to be honest I'd be lying if I said it was as 
easy as all that (it isn't, it's just not as hard 
as some of the later ones). So where are 
we? Well, it's the 1950s, you're in a 
restaurant in London's Hyde Park, and 
there's a giant alien space ship hovering 
above you. Instead of fedora, whip and 
so on (the outfit from the first game) Rick 
now comes in a fetching red jumpsuit 
thingie, (nasty) blond quiff and blue cape, 
and comes equipped with a few sticks of 
dynamite (useful for clearing blocked 
doorways or whatever) and the traditional 
hair-dryer style ray gun. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The screens themselves? Well, they're 
very colourful (pink, mainly!) and metallic 
looking, and in typical <I>Rick</I> style are 
basically a mass of platforms, ladders and 
dangerous drops. Typical gameplay 
elements, like the fact that you have to 
backtrack to press wall buttons (some of 
which are unfortunately booby-trapped!) 
on earlier screens in order to activate
doors, moving platforms or whatever crop 
up a lot, and are rather easier to work out 
than they may be later on in the game. 
The first of the tricky floor surfaces you'll 
come across throughout the game crops 
up too, this one being magnetised so you 
can't jump up onto platforms until you 
find an unmagnetised bit. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>Level Two - The Ice Caves Of Freezia </b><br>
This is based on the Ice World (I think it was 
a moon of Mango, Ming the Merciless's 
planet in the original, but I'm not sure) 
from the original serials and (before that) 
comic strip. Everything is very blue and icy 
looking of course, and really rather 
pretty. Baddies are yeti-type 
creatures, sort of mechanical 
penguins and various monsters 
that start off trapped in blocks 
of ice. These are quite neat - 
they fall from the ceiling as you 
pass by, thawing out quickly to 
reveal the nasties. The surface can 
be a bit spooky too, including (if I 
remember it all properly) deep snow that 
slows you right down. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>Level Three - The Forests Of Vegetalla </b><br>
Rather like the Ewok villages from the last 
<I><a href="starwars.htm">Star Wars</a></I> film (or Prince Barin's land in 
Flash Gordon), this basically takes the form 
of a whole series of platforms, ladders, 
huts (which you can walk into and out the 
other side) and so on based around the 
trunks of three giant trees. Unlike all the 
other levels, this one actually gives you a 
choice of routes - one up each tree, more 
or less, so you can chose a different one 
each time. Special bouncy floors help you 
jump to the higher platforms, and baddies 
take the form of Rick-eating plants, 
pigmies, super heavy leaves that knock 
you over if they land on you (!) and so on. 
It's the level that's most like what I
remember of the original Rick, but
perhaps a teeny bit more colourful.
It even features some tiny Ewoks 
bouncing around as a little joke in 
the 16 bit versions, but whether 
these'll filter down to the Speccy 
isn't clear yet. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>Level Four - Beneath The Alien Citadel</b><br>
Urn, don't know quite as much 
about this one, I'm afraid (perhaps 
because at the time I went to visit 
the programmers they'd hardly 
started it) but it's apparently very, 
urn, brown and muddy looking. It's 
basically set in a mud mine (an 
idea nicked from an old <I>Buck 
Rogers</I> apparently) filled with slimey 
mud men, conveyor belts, sticky 
floors that slow you 
down and moving 
mining carts. (It all 
sounds a bit like a '90s 
version of <I><a href="50bestspeccygames94.htm">Wanted: 
Monty Mole</a></I>.) 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>Level Five - The Citadel </b><br>
Urn, er, um. If they'd 
only just started the 
second level, they're 
hardly likely to have 
got very far with this 
one, have they? And 
indeed, they haven't. 
Expect bright, over the 
top decorations, lots 
of guards and various 
booby traps, I should 
think. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>Core blimey!</b><br>
So who are the guys behind <I>Rick The Dick 
2</I>? Well, they're the same bunch that did 
<I>Rick 1</I> (surprise surprise). Namely, Core 
Design - a bunch of about 12 or 13 mainly 
ex-Gremlln programmers who set up on 
their own a couple of years ago. Their stuff 
has included <I><a href="dynamitedux.htm">Dynamite Dux</a></I> for Activision, 
<I><a href="actionfighter.htm">Action Fighter</a></I> for Firebird, <I><a href="impossamole.htm">Impossamole</a></I> 
and the 16 bit <I><a href="switchblade.htm">Switchblade</a></I> (but not the 
upcoming 8 bit version) for 
Gremlin, <I>Monty Python</I> for Virgin 
(Just finished, and a bit of a 
nightmare to complete, 
apparently) and of course the two 
<I>Rick</I> games. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'It's quite fitting really,' says 
main man Jeremy Heath-Smith 
(an ex-Gremlln Sales Manager),
'we took the idea of <I>Rick</I> to Firebird 
a couple of years back and it turned out 
to be our first game as independent 
programmers. Now <I>Rick 2</I>'s almost ready 
and it'll be our last. You see, we're going 
to be publishing our own stuff from now on 
so we won't be doing programming for 
anyone else. The first of our own games 
will be out in August but it's 16 bit only I'm 
afraid - it'll be a long time (if ever) before 
you see another Speccy product from us.' 
The way Core tends to work is much more 
like a production line than you get at most 
developers. In this case Terry Lloyds and 
Simon Phipps (who designed the first Rick) 
came up with the basic ideas and then 
did the graphics, while Dave Pridmore 
wrote the code and did the music. All 
fairly normal you might think, but then a 
guy called Bob Churchill 
comes in, whose main 
job seems to be to 
actually work out the order in which each 
trap, platform and enemy appears. He's 
an experienced gamesplayer and tests 
the thing for ages, moving elements about 
until they appear at what he judges to be 
just the right time and in just the right 
order. If he thinks the first trap comes too 
soon after the second he'll move it along 
a bit. If he thinks half way through level 
two (say) is a bit boring, he'll shunt 
everything around to spice it up a bit. (It's 
a weird job alrlght but, well, somebody's 
got to do it). 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since everythlng's being done 
effectively in the same few rooms and 
each version is being developed at 
exactly the same speed as the rest, ideas 
filter through from one programmer to 
another quite rapidly. You'll find graphical 
differences between the machines of 
course, but the idea is that gameplay will 
be near as dammit exactly the same 
whatever version you buy. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Jeremy, did you come across any 
major massive problems doing this game? 
'Not at all. Not a sausage. Really, we 
knew what we wanted, we knew we 
could do it, and everythings's gone 
incredibly smoothly.' 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We ran out of tea once,' chips in Bob, 
'that was a bit of a disaster. We had to go 
down to Macro and buy 11,000 bags of 
new ones'. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The best bit, ' continued Jeremy,'was 
doing the research. Luckily the <I><a href="flashgordon.htm">Flash 
Gordon</a></I> serials were on TV quite recently 
so we've watched them all, and the film 
was on too so we got some ideas from 
that. Someone brought In a whole load of 
the original <I><a href="dandare.htm">Dan Dare</a></I> comics which got us 
into the feel of '50s sci-fi stuff too. Like with 
the first <I>Rick</I> we went through them all to 
see how they'd used each trap and 
situation and grabbed the best ideas for 
ourselves, then mixed them in with some 
we came up with on our own. Hopefully 
the game will remain very faithful to the 
spirit of the originals. And that's it really. 
<I>Rick</I>'s a lot of fun to write and a lot of fun 
to play. We hope this one does even 
better than the first.' 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if it's as good as (or better than!) 
the first we can only agree. Well done 
chaps, and if you change your minds 
about doing more Speccy games, give us 
a bell, y'hear?
