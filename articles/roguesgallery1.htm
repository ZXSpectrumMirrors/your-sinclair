<b>They made us laugh. They made us cry. They made us use words like "wibble". They were, of course, the salty seamen (and seawomen) at the helm of the good ship Your Sinclair, and they steered a bold course through the rocky shallows of the ZX Spectrum lagoon. They were the people who made it happen. Heroes. Scoundrels. Legends. Some claim these intrepid few are merely the half-remembered remnants of some fog-wreathed myth, etched into the primeval human consciousness like King Arthur, Robin Hood or Jeff Minter. Others believe they were the vessels for some benign other-worldly intelligence intent on planting the seeds of global harmony like ET, Starman or Jeff Minter. But they were real. They exist. They live! We found them; we quizzed them. Here's the whole sordid story in their own words...</b> 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><IMG ALIGN="LEFT" SRC="../jugglers/matt_bs.gif"><b><i><font size=+1>MATT BIELBY</font><br>"Look! You can see sheep in those fields!"</i></b><br> <br><b>Your YS nickname?</b><br> Oh God, I thought I'd escaped them at last. But as I recall, I was variously The Swoon King, because the ladies reputedly fell at my feet, a power that for some reason doesn't seem to work any more; Matt 'Goss', Your Sinclair's answer to Danny in The Partridge Family; and, eventually, Gadgy the Mutant Duck - this was when I was going a bit mad with power in my last few months on the magazine. I have, naturally, missed out the really embarrassing ones. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>What did you do on YS?</b><br> Well, I was Deputy Editor for two or three months, having arrived from <i>Computer & Video Games</i>, where I'd been a Staff Writer for most of a year. Then I became Editor. This was all from about Spring '89 to the beginning of '91, a significant time in the life of YS. For one thing, we became Britain's No.1-selling Speccy mag for the first time, and remained that way from then on (much more to do with the sterling work of many others than anything I had to offer, I hasten to add). For another, this was the period when Future Publishing bought the title, which meant moving lock stock from central London to Bath ("Look! You can see sheep in those fields!" we'd gibber, looking gobsmacked out of the window every day). It was pretty chaotic, all told, especially the bit in 1990 when we had to find a whole new team to replace the people we'd left behind in London. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>What have you done since?</b><br> I became Group Senior Editor at Future Publishing for many years, which was about as high up the editorial tree as you could go at the time, and personally launched a lot of the Future magazines in that period, including (deep breath): <i>Amiga Power</i>, <i>Super Play</i>, <i>PC Gamer</i>, <i>.net</i>, <i>SFX</i>, <i>Total Film</i>, <i>Arcade</i>, and <i>Official PlayStation 2</i>. I also did some work abroad for Future, including launching <i>PC Gamer</i> in the States. More recently, I've worked on various magazines for assorted companies, including the launch of Emap's <i>Zoo</i>. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><TABLE ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH=370><TR><TD ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="ys94pics/sheep.jpg"><br><b>Some sheep, in a field, yesterday</b></TD></TR></TABLE><b>What is your abiding memory of the Your Sinclair years?</b><br> Tiny offices - so small, at first, that David Wilson and I had to share the one desk, so one of us had to stand around like a lemon while the other typed, then vice versa. Great people - I learned about 80% of everything I know about magazines at YS, including the most important lesson of all: it's perfectly possible, and perhaps essential, to be both funny and serious at the same time. Pride - we looked at <i>Crash</i> (then past its best, admittedly) and <i>Sinclair User</i>, and knew we were the best. That was a nice feeling to have. And Whistlin' Rick Wilson's '<i>Hold My Hand Very Tightly (Very Tightly)</i>' being played on Radio One. The boy's a star! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>Favourite Spectrum game of all time?</b><br> I always liked my platform games, so maybe <i><a href="rainbowislands.htm">Rainbow Islands</a></i>, or going back a bit further, <i><a href="ystop100_4.htm">Manic Miner</a></i>. But it's the stuff that seemed truly original or ground-breaking that lingers: <i><a href="skooldaze.htm">Skool Daze</a></i>, <i><a href="headoverheels.htm">Head Over Heels</a></i>, <i>Ant Attack</i>. And who could forget Duncan MacDonald's truly hypnotic <i><a href="advancedlownmowersimulation.htm">Advanced Lawnmower Simulator</a></i>? Put it in a big installation at the Tate Modern, and it's a possible Turner Prize winner. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>Tell us a YS secret that you can now share with the world...</b><br> Contrary to popular belief, I was never a world-class games player. Indeed, to call my skills 'average' would be kind. Oh, and we never were based in a shed, as such. Artistic licence that one, I'm afraid. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><IMG SRC="../jugglers/tzer2.gif" ALIGN="LEFT"><b><i><font size=+1>TERESA MAUGHAN</font><br>"Nobody croons like David Wilson"</i></b><br> <br><b>Your YS nickname?</b><br> T'zer 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>What did you do on YS?</b><br> Production Editor, Deputy Editor, Editor and then Publisher. In reality, anything and everything. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>What have you done since?</b><br> All sorts, including cleaning up poo (I now have three children aged 11, 9 and 4), writing loads of pop books on everyone from Robbie Williams to Justin Timberlake, writing and editing the Channel 4 book on Model Behaviour, editing coffee-table book <i>Mohammed Ali: The Glory Years</i>, launching and packaging <i>Star Pets</i> magazine (aimed at girls and all about celebrities and their pets and pop) and a host of other more boring business stuff including doing production on <i>Linux User</i> magazine for a year or so. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR><TABLE WIDTH=210 ALIGN=LEFT><TR><TD ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="ys94pics/tzer_pic.jpg"><br><b>The thriving T'zer fan club continues to this day</b></TD></TR></TABLE><b>What is your abiding memory of the Your Sinclair years?</b><br> Laughing like a drain for four years solid. Listening to Snouty and Berkmann swap jokes continuously - some of them were actually funny. Dressing up in ridiculous outfits in the name of work. Young boys asking me to sign their T-shirts (and other things!) at the Earl's Court games shows - I could never understand why, as I didn't feel famous. Wondering whether Duncan MacDonald was going to show up for work or whether he was out on one of his 'jaunts'. <i>Hold My Hand Very Tightly</i> - nobody croons like David Wilson. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>Favourite Spectrum game of all time?</b><br> <i>Prince of Persia</i> - I loved the way he moved. Otherwise it has to be <i><a href="advancedlownmowersimulation.htm">Advanced Lawnmower Simulator</a></i> designed by Duncan McDonald. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>Tell us a YS secret that you can now share with the world...</b><br> Kevin Cox is a transvestite and likes to be known as Kylie to his friends.
