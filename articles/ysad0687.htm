Let's start with an incredibly important announcement. Well, a pretty ordinary announcement really, but you've got to try and make it dramatic, haven't you? What I'd like to do in a couple of months' time is prepare a page or two of hints and tips on <I>The Quill</I>, <I>GAC</I> and the other adventure writing utilities, which lots of you are asking about. Let me have your hints and also your questions, like this one from <b>Nic Malone</b>, Hindley, Wigan: "I bought <I>GAC</I> but the booklet doesn't mention character interaction. You don't seem to be able to hold conversations with characters. Can you do this?" Any experts care to comment? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mark Chapman</b> of Torquay has a useful POKE for PEEKing <I>Quill</I> vocabulary: 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10 For a = 27000 to 65535 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20 Let z = 233 - PEEK a + 32 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;30	IF z<32 or z>164 THEN GOTO 50 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;40 PRINT CHR$(z); 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;50 NEXT a 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheats of a different kind from <b>Rick Alexander</b> in Sale, who suggests that after climbing down the rope and pulling it in <I><a href="adventuregreats.htm">Bored Of The Rings</a></I>, part three, you type CHEAT to transport you past the basilisk. In <I><a href="tolkientrilogy.htm">The Hobbit</a></I>, if you find yourself trapped in the Elven Dungeon because the butler is dead and therefore unable to open the door, use the dreaded DO command to break down the door, then go to the cellar, take the barrel, throw it through the trap and jump after it. Finally, Rick says that to speed up completion of <I><a href="lordoftherings.htm">Lord Of The Rings</a></I> he gets Merry to kill the six riders on the East Road and the three in Bree and then Frodo and company can walk all the way along the East Road unharmed, not forgetting to pick Aragorn up on the way. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While mentioning <I><a href="tolkientrilogy.htm">The Hobbit</a></I>, thanks to all the readers who wrote to me pointing out that you can take Thorin through the Elven Dungeon with you towards the encounter with Smaug at the end. I'd said that you couldn't, you just picked him up on the way back. It just goes to show that there are different ways of completing this adventure. Some of you reckon you must have Thorin with you as he picks up Bard and takes him to kill Smaug. It ain't necessarily so. Most of the time Bard will respond to your instructions like BARD, "GO NORTH", and you don't need Thorin with you for that. Thanks to <b>Mark Haworth</b>, who wrote about this and also to say that the code for level 2 in <I><a href="adventuregreats.htm">Bored Of The Rings</a></I> is 'GOOD TIME'. Mark asks how to find a full solution to the game - send me an sae and ask for one! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lots of letters too about how to quench your thirst in <I><a href="eddiesmith.htm">Journey To The Centre Of Eddie Smith's Head</a></I>, and these also show there's more than one way to skin a cat or solve a problem. Among those taking the alcoholic approach is <b>Glynn Downing</b> of Waterlooville in Hants, who says that from the start you: TAKE AND WEAR COAT, TAKE KEYS, N, W, W, W, W, N, ENTER VAN, INSERT IGNITION KEYS, DRIVE NORTH, EXIT VAN, N, U, E, HIT WALL PANEL, E, TAKE BIG KEY, W, W, D, UNLOCK DOOR, D, TAKE WINE and drink the wine when you're thirsty. Another boozer with the same solution is <b>Terry Jones</b>, Northfleet, Kent. Terry adds that you should use the coffee to get rid of the teddy bear, though first you have to EEFFOC NOSIOP with CINESRA bought at the TSIMEHC. Now Terry's stuck, though, so can anyone tell him how the computer helps, what the sausages, drill, spade, gun and condenser are for, and is the cat that's sometimes in the maze any use at all? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hints are in already on <I><a href="mastersoftheuniverse.htm">Masters Of The Universe</a></I> from <b>Steven Conibear</b> of Birmingham. To find the sword, examine the bed and the post in the chamber, then go south, SSECER ENIMAXE and DROWS EKAT. To open the drawbridge you should TAOM MIWS as soon as you get to it, then DROWS HTIW SMRA FO TAOC TIH. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now a challenge to the <I>Really Kind Souls</I> out there. <b>Nicola Chottin</b>, who's 11 and lives at Brentwood in Essex, is trying to get hold of a poster and adventure player's guide to <I>Twin Kingdom Valley</I>. I don't know if a guide ever appeared from Bug-Byte, but maybe someone has a poster they wouldn't mind passing on to Nicola. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Always a <I>Really Kind Soul</I> is <b>Tom Frost</b>, who's sent me a solution to <I><a href="operationstallion.htm">Operation Stallion</a></I>, even though he's chasing the &pound;500 prize on offer from Wrightchoice for the first to complete the trilogy. I won't give away too many of the secrets, but one of the game's frustrations is knowing what to take from part one into part two. Tom's advice is to make sure you've got a flashlight, a file and a pencil, and then from the catalogue choose numbers 6, 11, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 and 23. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to <B>Peter Walsh</b> who sent me a solution to <I>Imagination</I> in exchange for the help I gave him, and so let me pass on some titbits from that. To get the yoyo, ELCICI EVIG. At the start of game four, don't forget to KCOSDNIW ENIMAXE. A useful command in game three is EGDIRB SSORCA EOTPIT. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>S. Wood</b> of Bishop Auckland writes saying that he or she bought <I><a href="bugsy.htm">Bugsy</a></I> on Feb 28th and solved it on March 1st. Is this a record? Could well be, provided it's not a leap year! S also asks how to defeat the dragon in the first part of <I><a href="sinbadandthegoldenship.htm">Sinbad And The Golden Ship</a></I>: EXA HTIW GNOG TIH then EXA HTIW NIAHC TIH. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Derek Tate</b> from Norfolk sent various bits and pieces of advice for <I><a href="lordoftherings.htm">Lord Of The Rings</a></I>, as well as asking me two million and one questions. Included in his advice was "A Derek the Troll Freebie!", so I'll pass that on now. To get through the Tower Hills, first go to the forest on the northern side of the hills, with the exits, N, SE and SW. From there go SW/S/E/NE/SW and you will now be out and able to explore the lands westwards. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My old friend Arthur Daley, sorry, <b>Arthur Simmons</b> of Birmingham says "How dare you say Birmingham's a foreign country, just think what Birmingham gave this country: <I>Crossroads</I>, Amy Turtle, Spaghetti Junction, the NEC and Ricardo Mapp, so what more could you want?" To which the country replies: let us know when you want them back and you can have them - except for Ricardo, who I'm a bit worried about as I haven't heard from him for a while. Are you still out there, Ricardo? Arthur says that my review of <I>Apache Gold</I> mentions an eagle with sticky wings, which is just what he needs as the unsticky eagle keeps swooping down and stealing the corn needed to make some moonshine. "Can you remember how you came across this perishing eagle?" Yes, I can, near to the protruding rock: KCOR TA ESOON WORHT. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From rocks to rock faces, and the sheer one in <I>Terrors Of Trantoss</I> that's puzzling several readers, including <b>BD Taylor</b> of Wirral. Thanks to <b>John Wilson</b>, who's cracked this tricky game at last, I can let you know that if you examine the location picture carefully you'll see a small red hole. This, you're meant to deduce without any help whatsoever, is a keyhole. Use the stone key on it. I won't print that one backwards as it sounds decidedly unfair to me. BD Taylor also asks how to open the crystal lid in the chest at Vendas Vault. First you must FFATS LYTE, if you haven't already, and forgive the spelling but that's what you need to do. Then you ELOH OTNI FFATS TRESNI. A handy object, that FFATS, 'cos it's also useful for knocking on doors and breaking them with. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another extremely sneaky problem that's puzzling plenty of readers is how to get anywhere at the start of <I>The Secret Of St Brides</I>. Some people have guessed that the secret lies with the mysterious door, and to open that door you need a LICNEP and a REPAPSWEN. You also need to enter four consecutive commands, thanks to <I>The Quill</I>'s two-word input routine, these being: ELOHYEK NI/LICNEP ESU/ROOD REDNU/REPAP ESU. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've mentioned before that although <b>John Barnsley</b>'s sent me a full solution for <I>St Brides</I> this makes no mention of a roundhead in the game. Lots of people have asked how to get rid of the roundhead, so thanks to all of you who wrote in, including Weymouth Adventurers Inc, to say that you DAEHDNUOR TOOHS with something you get from the station in the middle of nowhere. Even with a solution, I'm still having trouble with this game - I want to get through it to find where this blasted roundhead is, but although I've returned the cat to the woman and gone into the alchemist's workshop I can't get any further. TAKE DISSOLVER and STAND ON PLANK, is what I'm told I should do, but I can't get any response to the second input at all. So now it's my turn to ask you for clues this month - does anyone out there know what's going on? Help!!!
