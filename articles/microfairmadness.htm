<div>It's been quite a while since 
the last adventure based 
around the goings on at a 
Microfair, and this offering 
fills the gap quite nicely. It 
was written by Gareth 
Pitchford, programmed by The 
Spud, and this is a review of 
the 128K version... 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst waiting for the game 
to load you can gaze in awe at 
the game's central character 
(presumably) and a rather 
large green dragon who has 
his paws draped over a 
treasure chest. The game itself 
takes place at the marvellous 
Sir Clive Exhibition Hall and 
the occasion is a rather special 
one... it's the 100th Personal 
Computer Whirled Microfair! 
Only one small thing stops you 
enjoying the occasion, you've 
turned up without bringing 
your prized entrance ticket. 
The first three game locations 
will see that situation swiftly 
remedied, and you'll soon find 
yourself breezing past the 
hostile security guard who 
certainly wouldn't have let you 
in without one. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inside the hall it's a 
veritable world of wonders. 
Feel free to wander around for 
a bit and take in the sights. 
Progress past the first 12 or so 
locations is made impossible 
by the presence of a locked 
door in one direction, a dragon 
in another and a rather 
peculiar crate with a door in it 
which resides near some of the 
main Microfair stalls. As 
usual, all the best stalls selling 
all the best goodies are 
concentrated in one small 
area. There's Delbert The 
Hamster's stall, a Zenobi lookalike counter stands nearby 
(complete with fearsome, 
money-grabbing, whip-brandishing Balrog), and then 
there's the rather splendid 
<I>Your Sinclair</I> Adventures 
stall, complete with a rather 
shady character with his 
suitcase packed, waiting to 
leave on a holiday. The sign 
above the stall reads: <I>YS</I> 
Adventures, Under New 
Management! 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The early problems you 
encounter in Part One are, 
quite sensibly, simple to 
overcome. So it won't be too 
long before you're making 
steady progress. The only 
thing that had me reaching for 
the help-sheet, oh the shame of 
it, was that pesky dragon. The 
answer turned out to be 
simple, but I failed to make 
the connection between certain 
objects and the location of the 
dragon. I'd certainly advise 
you to try to take as much 
notice of locations, their 
contents, objects, character's 
fixtures and furnishings as you 
possibly can. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the dragon and the 
locked door, the game starts to 
open out. The problems may 
not come thick and fast, but 
there's certainly plenty to 
think about. The game scores 
high for originality and is also, 
on the whole, friendly enough 
to allow you to make a few 
attempts at finding the right 
words to do certain things 
without having to be spot on 
with your inputs. Likewise 
there's a rather noticeable lack 
of sudden deaths. Fortunately 
there's not too many places 
where you meet a sticky end, 
and the ones that are there are 
generally very well sign-posted. You know if you make 
a boo-boo you'll be paying for 
it! 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, back in the main 
hall things are buzzing along 
quite nicely. You can make a 
few purchases (and pinch the 
odd object too) and use these 
newly acquired items to gain 
access to other areas of the 
Microfair. The main problems 
to solve tend to be of the 'Get 
Objects X and Y', 'Manipulate 
X and Y to create Z' and 'Use Z' 
to overcome a problem that X 
and Y couldn't deal with on 
their own variety! There are 
several mini-adventures 
within the game and this has 
allowed the author to cram in 
some different and amusing 
sub-games to keep you on your 
toes. One of these gamettes 
consists of buying a disk, (from 
the Balrog) and using it on a 
computer to play <I>The Crazy 
Caravan Caper</I> adventure! Be 
warned that these sub-games 
offer the toughest challenges 
throughout the game. Once 
again I found myself reaching 
for the old help-sheet in order 
to complete the first mini-adventure. It wasn't 
particularly hard, it just had a 
rather severe time limit, so I 
just used the help-sheet to find 
the best and quickest way of 
doing things. Honest. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What would a Microfair be 
without its full compliment of 
performing fools and wacky 
characters? Well they're all 
here, from the annoying 
'Goons' who wander round 
being, er, annoying, to the 
'Steel Band' who don't need to 
wander around to be annoying! 
Later in the game you'll see 
that this is certainly no 
ordinary venue, for cutting its 
way though one part of the 
building is a river. This really 
needs to be crossed, and can 
indeed be overcome if you use 
a somewhat musical solution 
in a traditional way. (The most 
inventive method of crossing a 
river I've seen in a while.) 
The trick is to combine one 
third lateral thinking, one 
third object 
manipulation/examination and 
one third common sense. Those 
proportions, when properly 
mixed, usually result in a good 
game. <I>Microfair Madness</I> is no 
exception to that rule. There's 
more than enough to see and 
do on your travels, plenty of 
unusual objects to work out 
how (and where) to use, and a 
nice line in understated 
humour that bubbles around 
the surface of the game 
without getting in the way. 
Despite being a 128K two-parter, it's not especially huge 
on the surface. However, the 
little extra touches that have 
been worked into it, and the 
way you have to back-track 
every now and then, make it 
seem rather larger. The 48K 
version is, I'm assured, pretty 
much similar to this one, and 
is only missing some problems, 
text and locations. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A password is needed to 
access Part Two of the game 
(gained at the end of Part One) 
and it features more of the 
same type of thing found in the 
first bit, though things are 
definitely a shade tougher all 
round. Keep your eyes open for 
plenty more trade stalls, and 
characters with familiar 
sounding names. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I liked Delbert The 
Hamster's first release, 
<I>Desmond And Gertrude</I>, and 
<I>Microfair Madness</I> is an 
altogether better adventure, 
more polished, more inventive 
and it even manages to be 
funny when it tries to be. (A 
rare thing indeed!) It's a 
challenging game for the 
inexperienced adventurer, and 
should even give the hardened 
pros a bit of a run for their 
money.
