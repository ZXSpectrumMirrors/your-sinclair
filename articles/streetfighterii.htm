<div><b>Want to know how much 
Blanka weighs? Or what 
Chun Li's blood type is? 
Then <i>Street Fighter 2</i> is the 
game for you. The manual 
is full of this kind of stuff. Why? 
Nobody knows. It plays no part in the 
game itself, and not even the most 
ardent <i><a href="streetfighter.htm">Street Fighter</a></i> fans could think 
the characters are, well, real. <i>(Oh no!
Thousands of </i>Street Fighter<i> fans.)</i>
Oh, what a faux pas! </b>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the benefit of folk who've managed to 
steer clear of the consoles, the saturation 
advertising and every playground in the 
world for the last six months, <i>Street Fighter 2</i>
is a beat-'em-up. But that's not all! (Thinks.) 
Oh, yes it is. (Cough.) <i>(I remember that joke!
Coo, takes me back a bit. Ed)</i> It can be played 
two ways - either you're a single character out 
to beat up all the others in turn, or you take on 
a friend head-to-head. Whichever game 
you play, you'll have to master a 
complicated control method which 
involves pressing buttons and 
moving joysticks in strange ways. 
At least it's a little different, eh? Oh, 
please yourselves. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b><i>The good, the bad and 
the ugly </i></b><br>
<i>Street Fighter 2</i> is crammed with good points, 
bad points and, erm, ugly points. 
<i>(Congratulations! I take great pleasure in 
awarding you the trophy for Most Tenuously-Linked Headline On Page Twelve. Ed)</i> It's as if 
two sets of programmers were 
employed - one lot, studious 
and talented, intent on coding 
the best conversion possible, 
and another group who, 
basically, are crap. Let's take 
a trip through the game to 
demonstrate. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loading the program is a nightmare. It 
suffers from the worst ever Speccy multiload 
(yes folks, this 128K only game is a multiload... 
but it doesn't come on +3 disk). After loading 
the first bit, choosing a one- or two-player 
game, selecting your characters and the 
country they fight in, setting the 
difficulty level and defining the 
keys, you're presented with the 
message 'Start the tape'. No 
block names come up and 
there's no indication of which 
chunk of code the Speccy's 
looking for. So you have to let the 
tape run through the entire first side 
to pick up on the anonymous blocks the 
program wants. (Hope the two fighters you 
picked are near the beginning, because <i>Street 
Fighter 2</i> comes on a C60 tape.) And, after the 
fighters have loaded, you have to turn over and 
load the background graphics (though to be 
fair, you can turn these off from the main 
menu). And, yup, you have to run through the 
lot with no idea of the section the Speccy is 
looking for. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then! When you've 
finished your fight (which 
doesn't take that long) you 
have to rewind to the 
beginning of the first side 
(this is no joke, folks) and 
reload the entire thing to 
select your next opponent. 
Truly, a game where you 
spend more time loading than 
playing. Five words spring to 
mind: stupid, stupid, stupid. 
Stupid and STUPID. I had to 
snap various levels on to my 
+D just to save enough time to 
play the game. Ooo, I'm 
annoyed. <i>(Better move on to 
the good points then. Ed)</i>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the game has loaded 
(AARGHH!) and an obliging 
relative has woken 
you up, you can get on with the serious 
business of hitting somebody rather a lot. As 
we said in the preview a couple of issues ago, 
the graphics are very big (like <i><a href="finalfight.htm">Final Fight</a></i>'s) 
and very fast (not like <i><a href="finalfight.htm">Final 
Fight</a></i>'s at all then). The level 
of detail is, to be jolly 
honest, stunning. Rarely 
has a late-period Speccy 
game looked so good. And 
the artists haven't shirked 
on the backgrounds either 
- they're also packed with 
excitingly grouped pixels. 
The sound is okayish - 
some white noise thumps and crunches - but 
nothing special. Still, eh? <i>(Well put. Ed)</i> 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As mentioned above, control is a mixture of 
button pushing and odd joystick movements. 
Apart from the obvious punching, jumping and 
kicking, each fighter has a load of secret 
moves. The trick is, you have to work out 
exactly what to push and pull in order to 
access them. Some are fairly straightforward - 
to make Ken punch up and knock out any 
jumping opponents 
you pull him down into a crouch, 
then hit jump and fire 
simultaneously - but the majority 
will only be found by twiddling 
everything in sight. (Have those 
notepads ready, folks.) In addition, 
the fighters have special attacks, 
like piledrivers, fireballs and so on. 
Luckily, the manual tells you how to 
do these. Phew, eh? Playing 
against a Speccy opponent, I very 
quickly got bored, gameplay being 
reduced to the oh-so-usual hit the 
buttons at random nonsense. 
However, with two players it's a 
whole different kettle of lemons. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b><i>It's a knockout!</i></b><br>
Sample two-player <i>Street Fighter 2</i>
game: 'Ha!' 'Aarghh!' 'Oh, come <i>on</i>!' 
'You rat!' 'I felt that!' 'You complete 
rat!' 'Bite yer head!' 'Rats!' 
'Didn't see that one coming, did 
you?' 'I hate you.' 'Another 
go?' You get the idea. 
Because of the sheer variety 
of moves each player can 
make, a bit of strategy creeps 
in to the game in the form of 
deciding who's the best character 
to beat your opponent's champion. You 
find yourself trying all sorts of unlikely joystick 
combinations to try to unearth those secret 
moves. (There's nothing quite like unleashing a 
move that your opponent doesn't even know 
exists, heh heh heh.) It is, to put in non-YS, 
sensible language, incredibly good fun. Or, to 
put it in YS-y lingo, it's a stonking corker with 
marvy graphics and the elusive cherry of 
playability perched on top. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the atmosphere of corporate 
facelessness doesn't spoil the game. <i>(Eh? Ed)</i>
Let me explain. <i>(Oh good. Ed)</i> The manual is 
quite smart, detailing most of the moves the 
characters can perform in a friendly and 
readable style. Then! When you load 
the game (AARGHH!) you get a 
message saying 'Due to machine 
limitations, this version may differ 
from examples in the manual.' So, 
erm, what you're saying then, US 
Gold, is that unspecified portions of 
the the manual are, erm again, 
useless. Or in other words, the profit 
margin wasn't enough to print a bit 
of paper saying 'So-and-so moves 
aren't available on the Speccy 
version' rather than leaving you to 
work out whether the move is really 
missing, or whether you're just not 
trying to access it properly. Well, 
thanks a bunch. <i>(Steady on, 
Jonathan. Ed) </i>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But enough of this scampish 
sarcasm. It's summary time! 
(Sound of small fanfare on plastic 
trumpets.) From the top - the one-player mode is very boring. Without 
another human player, the game is 
just another fight number. But! 
Grab that close friend and give 
'em a joystick (using keys is far 
easier) and I think everyone will 
agree that <i>Street Fighter 2</i> is highly 
playable and immense fun. What a 
tragedy then that it's been seriously 
injured (nay, practically crippled) by a 
horrible, asinine multiload system. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As with all beat-'em-ups it's a one-note 
game, but the diversity of moves and 
characters ensures it will last a good deal 
longer than most. (If your tape recorder can 
stand it.) Now if you'll excuse me, I'm off to 
challenge Linda. She doesn't know about 
Zangief's spinning piledriver, and I'll feign 
innocence until (ar-har) she's in me power! 
(Twiddles imaginary moustache.) <i>(Not so fast, 
you dastardly villain! You forgot that I have to 
check the page before it goes to the printers. 
Ed)</i> Curses! Foiled again. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>Stuart Fighter 2</b><br>
<i>Street Fighter 2</i> has stopped the largest 
number of passers-by since <i>Invaders</i>. Mostly 
the gawpers have been people amazed US 
Gold could fit the game on to the Speccy, but 
a few have taken up the challenge of actually 
playing the blessed thing and comparing it to 
the umpteen other versions around. Stuart 
Campbell and his haircut are just such a truly 
inimitable pair.

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, so Jonathan's    
pretty well covered 
Speccy <i>SF2</i> as a game, 
but how does it measure up 
to the other format versions? 
Um... oh dear. The graphics are actually very 
close to the original (except colour-wise, 
obviously), but in all honesty the gameplay 
(which ought to be perfectly feasibly 
convertible) just doesn't cut the mustard. The 
Speccy is positively awash with keys, which 
ought to make recreating the coin-op's six-button control an absolute doddle, but the 
one-fire-button system used here doesn't work 
nearly as well as even the Amiga version, and 
the SNES leaves them both behind. 
Combined with the icky key responses, 
Speccy <i>SF2</i> is more of a 'hit the controls at 
random and hope for the best' affair than ever. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>A useful guide to <i>Street 
Fighter 2</i> phrases</b><br>
Although the Speccy version lacks the 
speech samples of the console programs, 
the manual handily prints all the things the 
fighters shout at each other. YS presents a 
short phrasebook that will gain you instant 
credibility wherever two console owners are 
gathered, as you interrupt their chatter by 
translating that enigmatic fightin' talk. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ha do ken</b>        Hello, Ken 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tatsu maki sen 
pu kyaku</b>         I would like to purchase 
that oversized hamster. 
Do you accept credit 
cards? Please post my 
hamster in a tube to 
circumvent inconvenient 
quarantine laws. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Sho ryu ken</b>       Are you sure you're 
Ken? 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Yoga nugie</b>       Yoda would like some
