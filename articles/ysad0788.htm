Corrections first. If any of you grubby little perverts out there managed to drag your eyes away from the cover of the May issue and read the adventure section, then you would have seen the following sentence, "<b>Peter Robinson</b> from Grimsby wants to know what to do after the Post Office job in <I><a href="bugsy.htm">Bugsy</a></I>" This was fine as far as it went - trouble is, it was only the first half of the sentence, as someone snipped out the next bit, with the answer to Peter's question! <I>(Ooops, sorry! Inefficient Prod Ed)</I> So, two months late, here's the second half: SELCSUM DNA EIVOL ERIH. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, my own deliberate mistake has been to lose someone's address, so if <b>Anne Turnbull</b> of Co. Durham wants the thrill of appearing in <I>Kind Souls</I> she'd better let me know where she lives! What a way to treat a lady, and after she sent me a map to <I>Serfs Tale</I> too. Which I <I>didn't</I> lose. What I am in danger of losing is what's left of my sanity, which may not be much after so long at YS, but I want to hang onto what's left! What chance, though, when you have to deal with the likes of the Berk-ing mad <b>Matthew Conway</B> and the <b>Abertillery Ariagram</b>. At least the Anagram makes himself useful by sending me in solutions, like the recent one to <I>Don't Panic, Panic Now!</I>, and by sending me in utility-writing tips, which I'm collecting for a future issue. Good job he does, as he also asks me silly questions, like 'Where's the birdseed in <I>Serfs Tale</I>? Guffaw. Just 'cos there's a bird doesn't mean there's seed. If you want to get the bird, which you certainly should after a question like that, DOR TON TUB EGAC EVAH. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Conway, what can you do with him? Ignore him and hope he'll go away? Maybe some reader can help keep him occupied by providing him with the map that he wants for <I><a href="ystop100_4.htm">Lords Of Midnight</a></i>. I've never seen such an object in all my adventuring existence, but if you happen to have one and a 20-ton truck to deliver it in, send it over to <b>Matthew Conway</b>, Lambourn, Berks. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps I could introduce Conway to Infected Software and hope he comes down with the Dreaded Lurgy. Infected Software is the tastefully named company who produced <I>Basque Terrorists Loose In Dartford</I>, an adventure whose very existence I doubted when <b>Philip Hancock</b> asked a question about it back in the April issue. Infected Software has written back in the shape of R. Smith, who signs himself Managing Director, Packaging Director, Advertising Director...! A busy man, but not too busy to explain that the code to open the safe is obtained by comparing the code with the note you find in the car. Pick the correct letters out of the message "Don't forget to drop my water, now," and the answer has a Turkish connection - and I don't mean you'll be delighted when you work it out. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone else with a bad code is <b>Alan Kinniburgh</b> of No Fixed Abode, who asks what the password is to the gravestone in <I>Matt Lucas</I>. The answer: TUO. Another kind-hearted software company is Pelagon Software, who helped out a <I>Lost Soul</I> who was stuck in a game of its called <I>Terraform</I>. Author of the game, G. Power, never missing the chance for a quick plug, says it's still available from him for just &pound;1.30. Okay, okay, you'll get your free ad for your kindness. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Andrew Pendrick</b> of Bury St Edmunds is struggling along in <I><a href="gnomeranger.htm">Gnome Ranger</a></I>, and I could have helped him stop struggling a lot sooner if he'd sent the compulsory stamped addressed envelope, but the poor lad obviously couldn't afford 13p. Shame. Still, to get out of the bog without dropping everything, ENOEMOS WOLLOF. What use is the shovel? WOBNIAR EHT TA GID OT. How to get at the witch before being turned to stone? That's easy as you can't, but someone you haven't met yet can. Besides, it's the last thing you do in part one. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another pauper is <b>Robert Wilkins</b> of Carmarthen, who's a newcomer to adventures and asks for tips on the four of them in <I>Scott Adams Scoops</I>. But no sae! Naughty boy. In fact <I>Scott Adams</I> games are not the best for newcomers, but I'll send you some help if you help me by enclosing a sae. Oh, I'm a real meanie, I know. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Nigel Jeffries</b> of Cardiff was a good boy so I was able to answer his questions on <I><a href="adventuregreats.htm">Valkyrie 17</a></I>, and tell him to ignore the ventilation grille in the laundry, ignore the ski hut (but take what's outside), and ignore the room across the corridor opposite the one with the safe in it. See. I can be helpful sometimes! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>W J Harley</b> of Newbury says he's been disappointed not to see any tips on <I>Knight Orc</I> in recent issues. I dunno, you can't win sometimes. Some readers tell you off for giving out hints on new releases, and others tell you off if you don't. You rotten lot. Anyway, Mr Harley (any relation to Jim Davidson?), the mouse in <I>Knight Orc</I> takes a lot of catching, and to get it you'll need the EYE spell first. You'll also need the silver moon, pebble and sack. And you can't deal with the dragon till you've caught the mouse, and you can't deal with the troll till you've dealt with the mouse and the dragon! To get into the castle you'll need to cast a spell on part of the drawbridge. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll give a quick mention to <b>Kez Gray</b>, as I'm sure you could all do with a good laugh. Kez nominates herself for a Manuel Award because she was creating some adventure graphics screens and carefully saved all seven of them onto tape... and then recorded over them with Jasper Carrott's version of <I>The Magic Roundabout</I>... Oh how I laughed. Well, we've all done it once - bet you don't do it again, though. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ben Allard</b> of Norwich asks about that golden oldie, <I>Golden Apple</I>, which obviously hasn't lost its appeal. Cor, what an adventure! To use the ON LAMP command you must, SEHCTAM EHT YRRAC. And you can't repair the bridge till you've got something you need from within the cave, for which you need the lamp, though there's a little sneaky twist when you go into the cave so watch out for that. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bundle of questions from <b>Trevor Taylor</b> of York, including some of Tartan's games. In <I>Castle Eerie</I>, what use is the oil? WAS EHT LIO. To open the metal box in the cellar REMMAH EHT HTIW TI KAERB. In <I>Ship Wreck</I>, to get some money, NIBAC RUOY YDIT Like several people, Trevor asks about getting through the Iris Door in <I><a href="kayleth.htm">Kayleth</a></I>. This is almost the last thing you do in the game, and you won't be able to sort it out till you have five AZAP codes, but when you've got those five you should be able to rearrange the letters to make some kind of sense. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ray Cole</b> of Nottingham sends some tips on <I>Rigel</I>, which I know will be helpful to lots of people who've written in. If you're struggling in Suburbia, TSOPPMAL BMILC. If you're stuck in the desert, SPETS ECARTER. To get past the robo-tank, GOD LLAMS OT ENOB EVIG then go back to the tank and HTUOS OG. In the plaza in part two, HCTAP EHT ERONGI TUB SEHCNEB REDNU KOOL. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any would-be artists out there willing to help a fellow adventurer? <b>Paul Cardin</b> of Wallasey, Merseyside is just finishing off an adventure he's written using <I>GAC</I> and <I>The GACPAC</I>, ("excellent... I'd be lost without it," Paul says), but he hasn't a clue about doing a loading screen and would like to hear from anyone who could help him out. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Labouring in <I><a href="thelaboursofhecules.htm">The Labours Of Hercules</a></I> are Mr and Mrs Carney of Leeds. "Can you or anybody please tell us how to capture the hind? Reference books state that it was his easiest task, so how come we've spent weeks trying to do it?" Ah, these devious adventure writers. You can't capture the hind (actually it's the Cerynitian Stag), in the location where you first meet it, instead you have to look around for a place where you think it might come to graze. EERT BMILC and then TIAW. When the Stag appears, just TEN PORD on it, then go down and EPOR HTIW GATS EIT, otherwise it'll be up and away within three moves. And for anyone who hasn't tried this game, I've had nothing but praise for its professionalism and deviousness from everyone that's played it. Definitely worth taking advantage of the YS special offer on this one. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, adventure-playing <b>Daniel Haigh</b> of Leicestershire has been musing (they can't touch you for it), on the face that if Sir Clive Sinclair had had a different name, then we might have bad to call the mag <I>Your Trumpington-Smythe</I> or something similar. Well, it could have been worse. Suppose Graham Willie had invented the Spectrum? What would you have been holding in your hands right now?
