<div><b>As it says on the box of 
this game, '1 WAR 
WUNDERBAR, 2 WAR 
SCHRECKLICH UND 3 IST 
DIE ENDGULTIGE 
HERAUSFORDERUNG!' What? Oops, 
been reading the German instructions 
by mistake. What it actually says is '1 
WAS WONDERFUL, 2 WAS 
TERRIFIC, 3 IS THE ULTIMATE 
CHALLENGE'. What could they be 
talking about? The Alien movies? 
The Popeye games? The World 
Wars? <I>(They're talking about the 
</I>Football Manager<I> games, stop 
being so ruddy stupid. Ed) </I></b>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, blimey. Another Speccy football 
management game, eh? Just what we needed. 
What next, I wonder? <I>Football Manager Dizzy</I>? 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Football Manager 3</I>, the latest in a long line, 
has had nearly ten years to take the best 
aspects of hundreds of other footy 
management games and turn them all into one 
indisputable, unbeatable classic. What's it 
come up with? Well. You get to pick your team, 
and choose which style they play in. You can 
buy other players, by ringing up their 
manager on the telephone and offering him 
lots of money - realistic or whal? You can train 
all your players individually, so that some of 
them are really good and some of them are 
really crap (or something). You can, er, switch 
on a desktop computer and, urn, see what
games you've got coming tip in the next few 
weeks. Or - AHA! - you can actually play a 
game and watch the action unfold in front of
your eyes! Brilliant! Let's get on with it, then! 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b><I>Swings and 
roundabouts </I></b><br>
Oh dear. The rnatch sequence in 
<I>Football Manager 3</I> consists of a tiny 
little rectangular pitch occupying about 
half of the screen, (with no centre circle or 
penalty-box arcs, natch) covered in little stick 
players even smaller than the ones in the 
original <I><a href="ystop100.htm">Football Manager</a></I>, which all lurch 
around colour-clashing horribly. This is 
accompanied by a fantastic commentary along 
the lines of 'Number Six has the ball', 'Number 
Ten goes in for the tackle', 'lnnes shoots', 
'Graeme Souness gets sent out of the dugout' 
and all that kind of thing. It is, frankly, crap. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But. Hey, ifs not all bad. Apart from the 
rubbish match sequence, <I>Football Manager 3</I> 
is all right, as far as this kind of thing goes. It's 
not quite up to the standard of <I><a href="footballmanagerii.htm">Football
Manager 2</a></I>, to be honest, with vastly inferior 
presentation and graphics, and lots of hanging around while the computer thinks and doesn't seem to be working properly. Still, it's got enough statistics and stuff to be passably realistic, without having so many that you get completely lost in a maze of menus and totally bored. The front end leaves a lot to be desired, but I did really like the way it said "Hello!!!" as its program name when it loaded up. So, swings and roundabouts really.

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<center><b><I>Football Manager 3</I> - just why has it 
got such a blimmin' big box, then? </b></center>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most interesting thing of all about 
<I>Football Manager 3</I> is probably its 
packaging. As well as a tape containing 
both the Speccy and Amstrad versions 
of the game (don't try and load the 
Amstrad version then come back ten 
minutes later and wonder why nothing's 
happened, like I did) and a tiny little bit 
of folded paper containing the 
instructions, you also get a cardboard 
box the size of Albania. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is this? Is it so that you can take 
the whole thing along to 
real football matches 
and use it as a 
rattle? I shouldn't 
think so. Is it so 
that you don't lose 
it in the piles of 
rubbish on the floor 
of your bedroom and 
then accidentally stand on it? Probably 
not. No, it's more likely something to do 
with what the software 'industry' calls 
'perceived value'. Apparently, they think 
that if you see a huge great box on the 
shelf at WH Smith's instead of a poxy 
little cassette case, you'll automatically 
go 'Coo! That game's in a really big 
cardboard box, so it must be at least 
four times as good as one that comes 
in a box a quarter of the size! I'm going 
to buy that at once, and what's more 
it's such a great-looking package that I'll 
quite happily pay much more than the 
usual price for it. Hurrah!' 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is, of course, extremely stupid. 
As we all know, what you really think is 
'Coo! That game's in a really big 
cardboard box, so it'll never fit in my 
tape racks, and it's so big that when I 
put it on the floor I won't possibly be 
able to avoid standing on it and 
rendering it completely crumpled, tatty 
and crap-looking. I'll be avoiding that 
one like the plague until it comes out as 
a budget re-release in a nice sensible 
compact cassette case in six months' 
time, that's for sure.' 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Software houses, eh? 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<center><b>The <I><a href="ystop100.htm">Football Manager</a></I> saga - an 
exhaustive historical essay </b></center>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first <I><a href="ystop100.htm">Football Manager</a></I> game is a bit of a 
legend in Speccy (indeed, computers in 
general) gaming history. Released in 1983, 
from roots on the ZX81, it boasted lots of 
complicated footy strategy stuff (injuries, 
transfers, and, er, not much else, really), but 
more importantly '3D animated match 
highlights!' While these consisted of static 
line-drawn screens of the goalmouth with tiny 
character-square players lurching around in 
leaps of about 10 feet at a time and stretched 
the definition of '3D' to its very limits, they 
were still a complete revolution, as well as 
being fantastically entertaining. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Largely as a result of this, the game, 
written by a middle-aged giant of a man with 
a very suspect beard called Kevin Toms (the 
man, that is, not the beard), was a massive 
success. It sold well over 100,000 copies (an 
absolutely staggering figure - for comparison, 
a top-selling Speccy title these days will shift 
about, ooh, 1500 if it's lucky), and inspired a 
million (approximately) imitators. These were 
all totally crap, because they missed the point 
utterly and concentrated on filling the game 
with thousands and thousands of statistics 
and number-juggling and dispensed with the 
match graphics sequence completely. How 
stupid can you get, eh? All that tedious 
traipsing around a million menu screens, 
hanging around for hours while the program 
(invariably written in BASIC) decided what it 
wanted to do, and then no reward at the end 
of it all other than a black screen announcing 
'Hartlepool 1 Walsall 0'. Whoopee. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, dozens of crap clones later, the 
man the universe had come to know as 
'Uncle Kevin' decided that enough was 
enough, and set about writing a proper 
sequel. <I><a href="footballmanagerii.htm">Football Manager 2</a></I> added all sorts of 
clever extra stuff with tactics and formations 
and substitutions and training and so on, as 
well as a vastly-prettier match 
highlights section which 
actually showed you (ulp!) 
the entire game! 
Unfortunately, in a 
particularly action-packed 
match, watching the whole 
game could take anything 
up to ten minutes, which 
meant that playing through 
a whole season could call 
for a nine-hour session. 
Still, apart from that, 
<I><a href="footballmanagerii.htm">Football Manager 2</a></I> was a 
bit of a corker, striking just 
about the best balance to 
date between trainspotter 
technical accuracy and 
strategic depth, and the 
zingier, prettier, action side 
of things. More crap copies 
followed, all of which were 
unbearably dull, with the 
possible exception of <I><a href="tracksuitmanager.htm">Tracksuit Manager</a></I>, 
which Jon likes. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around the time of the last World Cup, 
Addictive produced a <I>Football Manager - 
World Cup Edition</I>, which was a completely 
new game featuring a revolutionary 
manager's pep-talk session, where you could 
shout at your players after a heavy beating, 
or lavish praise on them after an impressive 
win, in an attempt to goad them into 
action/pump up their morale. It was cute, but 
novelty-value only, really, and nothing very 
much came of it. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, of course, we've got <I>Football 
Manager 3</I>. Um...
