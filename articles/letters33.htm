<p> <font size=4><b> SOOTHSAYER?</b></font><br> I am very angry about the covers of your magazine. They have become more and more lurid every month. My son is 11 and I am going to stop him getting <i>YS</i> on subscription as there is too much emphasis on violence (page 18, June issue) and a blatantly sexy picture on page four. What are you going to do about this as a responsible editor? Do you want our children fed on a diet of sex and violence? Your artist is getting carried away and the June cover of <i>Psycho Pig</i> is utterly revolting. I shall also be complaining to the advertising standards authority. <br> <b> Mrs R. Sayer <br> </b> <br><i> Blatantly sexy picture on page four??? Surely you can't mean that adorable little rodent, </i><a href="mickeymouse.htm">Mickey Mouse</a><i>? Perhaps you mean page six, and if you do we certainly owe you an apology. That piccie of Bob Holness was a bit extreme - even for us! <b>Ed</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> EWE WHAT?</b></font><br> I would like to put the record straight about the RAM in the 48K Spectrum. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maximum amount of RAM in the 48K is 49152 bytes. This does not equal 48000 I hear you say... If you divide 49152 by 1024 (which is exactly 1K), hey presto, you get the answer 48!!! So now you know why Clive Sinclair called the 48K Spectrum a 48K Spectrum. <br> <b> Andrew West <br> Newton Abbot <br> </b> <br><i> Okay clever clogs. Why did he call the C5 the C5 ? <b>Ed</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> WORRA TACKLE</b></font><br> Today I bought <i><a href="targetrenegade.htm">Target Renegade</a></i>, loaded it up and started to play. I managed to reach the second level and then I died. I was that mad that I smashed my hands on the right hand side of my +3. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly I had all my lives back, and was back on level two. Eventually I reached the last level where I was shaken to death by a large man, but I was awarded more lives. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well.... is this a poke? <br> <b> Darren Godfrey <br> Rugby, Warks <br> </b> <br><i> No, but it's quite funny though! It's the way I tell 'em! <b>Ed</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> THE STYLESTICKS</b></font><br> I like your style. Who makes up the titles for the competitions? Do you just cut up a lot of magazines and throw the pieces at a wet desk and print what sticks? <br> <b> Kathleen McHale <br> Normanton, West <br> Yorkshire <br> </b> <br><i> Those heads take hours to come up with, I can tell you. We spend ages cutting up the mags and use gallons of water. And you should see the size of the desk! <b>Ed</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> PRICELESS</b></font><br> I just wrote to point out that the bods at Gremlin obviously overlooked the fact that <i><a href="northstar.htm">Northstar</a></i> is actually an industrial estate in Swindon, and not an abandoned orbiting space station as they would have us believe. <br> <b> Thomas Price <br> Exmouth, Devon <br> </b> <br><i> You'll be telling us next that the Magic Knight isn't a hero with special powers born of a land of fantasy, but a British Rail ticket collector at Swansea! <b>Ed</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> IT'S A MYSTERY</b></font><br> So who thought a Speccy was perfect in every way? Type this in first. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10 PRINT "Any old trash" 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20 GOTO 10 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now type in RUN and when it gets to the point of saying SCROLL?, press Caps-Lock and pow!... It prints the last thing you typed! But still there is no end; type in anything else (try Enter - weird) and you have a screen full of trash. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Explain that then! What the heck is it? <br> <b> L. Geary <br> Walsall, W. Midlands <br> </b> <br><i> Well I'm jiggered if I know! Does anybody out there know what's going on? Sounds like a load of old garbage to me! <b>Ed</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> MAD DOGS AND ENGLISHMEN</b></font><br> The sun rises as the cumbersome craft streaks across the sky. The occupant - Colonel Sledger McCoy of the E.D.F. <br> <b> Martin 'Mad-Dog' Lawless <br> E.D.F. Information Inc. <br> Bury, Lancs <br> </b> <br><i> Are you the real McCoy? You know, the one who travelled on the very famous spaceship, The Starship Enterprise? If so, that's highly illogical, 'cos he's dead, Jim! <b>Ed</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> THREE OF A KIND</b></font><br> I get your mag every month from the shop (and will be subscribing soon), and I enjoy it greatly, but I do have a criticism which led me to write this letter. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I own a totally wazzy +3 and prefer to buy games on disk as so many things go wrong with tapes, but your mag does not cater for us +3 users. When I want to buy a game I refer back to <i>YS</i> to help me choose, but l don't know from your reviews whether the game is on disk and if so how much it costs. So PLEASE could you list the disk price along with the tape price at the top of your reviews, and if there isn't a disk version then say so! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from that, keep up the good work and I will remain a regular purchaser of your brill meg. <br> <b> Nell Kingham <br> South Woodford <br> </b> <br><i> Usually we do mention if the game's on disk and how much it costs. Sometimes though the companies producing the games haven't yet decided whether a particular title will be on disk or how much it will cost. But rest assured that from now on we will endeavour to put all +3 details in the review. Happy now? <b>Ed</b> </i> <p> <TABLE align=center BORDER BGCOLOR=white BACKGROUND=""><TR><TD> <FONT SIZE=6><B><U>STAR LETTER</U></b></font><br><font size=4><b> THE GBOOD, THE BGAD AND THE UGLY</b></font><br> I have noticed a strange word which appears on your letters page often. The word is '(fnar)'. What does this mean?, I puzzled. After some time I came to the conclusion that (a) I am old and out of touch, and (b) that it means neither near nor far, i.e. 'It is fnar to the shop' would mean 'It is not far to the shop, nor is the shop near.' 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further reading of your June issue <i>Letters Page</i> gave me rather a bgad (neither bad nor good) idea. It would be a gbood (neither good nor bad), idea if your magazine set aside a page devoted to your oyld (neither old nor young), readers. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <i>Oyld Page</i> could possibly contain reminiscences of days gone by - old <i>Bisto</i> adverts, thrupenny bits, ten-bob notes and Jack Wild. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would be willing to be appointed Ed of the <i>Oyld Page</i> and my credentials are as follows: bags under eyes, the odd grey strand of hair and this letter (a token of my journalistic talents). I have numerous ideas for the <i>Oyld Page</i> and await your cheque before sending you my first article. <br> <b> Mrs. M. Inman <br> Luton, Beds <br> </b> <br><i> A page for senior citizens? No thanks. You lot can just stick to blocking the aisles of buses with your carrier bags and complaining about the price of stamps. Besides if we do need an oldie on the staff then the new dep Ed is more than qualified. <b>Ed</b> </i> <p> </td></tr></table><p> <font size=4><b> STREETS AHEAD</b></font><br> I'm writing to point out but three things: 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. When I bought last month's mag I was so upset that you didn't print my letter thanking you for sending me those brill badges, so I hope you'll print this one. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. In last month's mag (again), I was doing the prize crossword on page 88 <i>(Pete's Puzzlers)</i> when I noticed something wrong. Next to 20 across should be another word down, but there's no number on it! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Looking at your picture at the top of the letters page I gasped in amazement at the resemblance between you and Janet Street-Porter! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just take a butchers at the two piccies! <br> <b> Rosaria Di Natale <br> London, SW4 <br> </b> PS I love that cartoon shcp called <i>Monty &amp; Chums</i> about the potatoes. <br> <br><i> <p><center><a href="../thumbs/letters/big/33b.jpg"><IMG SRC="../thumbs/letters/33b.jpg"></a></center><p> How dare you! I look nothing like Janet Street-Porter! She's got long hair! And yes we know there was a mistake in </i>Pete's Puzzlers<i> - as punishment Peter will be taking the starring role as a potato in the next </i>Monty &amp; Chums<i> cartoon! <b>Ed</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> DARLING, DARLING...</b></font><br> I love you. I have fallen so much in love with you that I take my <i>YS</i> to bed with me. Anyway, back to the point: I have compiled a chart of your cover-mounted games. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 ) p.88 Pete Shaw's Prize Kwizword - There are two unnumbered words in the grid that have no clues to them! If Pete Shaw improves on this in the July issue, somebody should give him the prize. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) p.47 &amp; p.63 The screenshots from <i><a href="sophistry.htm">Sophistry</a></i> and <i><a href="rastan.htm">Rastan</a></i> have been printed on the wrong page! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) p. 106 Backstabbin' - The header contains the name Zaza Gabor. Surely you mean Zsa Zsa Gabor? Zaza was a character from the BBC-TV series <i>Hector's House</i>! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4) p.58 Mickey Review - The first cartoon that Mickey Mouse appeared in was called <i>Plane Crazy</i> (1928 silent), and not <i>Steamboat Willie</i> ( 1928 sound) as suggested. This only goes to prove what I've said all along - Marcus Berkmann is Goofy! 
<BR>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>ARIES </b><br> (Mar 21-Apr 20) Mercury has just moved into your sign which means there's an incredible amount of romance on the cards. Trouble is that being such a fast moving planet, it's just moved out of your sign again. Seems you've 'missed the boat' as they say. Bad luck 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR><B>TAURUS </b><br> (Apr 21-May 21) Mercury's bombing through your sign. Go and ask someone out. Quick, quick, quick ... aaaaaahhhh, too late. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>GEMINI </b><br> (May 22-Jun 21) Oh dear. Mercury seems to have crashed into the sun and explodcd. This doesn't auger too well for shopping trips on the l9th or the 22nd. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>CANCER </b><br> (Jun 22-Jul 22) The sign of the crab. Incredibly apt this month actually, as you will be shuffling around sideways on a beach somewhere. Watch ouf for predators wearing green. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>LEO </b><br> (Jul 23-Aug 23) The King of the Zodiac - aren't you the lucky one. In a survey, eight out of l0 doctored birth certificates had been altered to place their owners under this sign. The frauds! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>VIRGO </b><br> (Aug 24-Sep 23) All the planets have just moved into Virgo. As a consequence there isn't much room left for you, so I suggest you move temporarily to another starsign. (Leo's quite a good one) 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>LIBRA</b><br> (Sep 24-Oct 23) Pluto sauntering through your fourth quadrant indicates a right Royal carry on this month. You'll go fishing with Charles on the 25th and you might bump into Di at the hairdressers on the 28th. Wear blue. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><B>SCORPIO </b><br> (Oct 24-Nov 22) Nasty pieces of work, Scorpios! They'll bite off their nose to spite their face, and steal chocolate from babies - things like that. This month keep your eyes peeled for a toddler in red. His smarties will be easy to 'liberate'. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>SAGITTARIUS </b><br> (Nov 23-Dec 21) Mars will be entering your sign at the end of the month, which is a bit embarrassing really as it owns two of the crappiest moons in the Solar System: Phobos and Deimos, the 'giant potato' satellites. Lie low and wear orange. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>CAPRICORN </b><br> (Dec 22-Jan 20) Thanks to the appearance of Neptune you will become an advertising copywriter. Your third slogan; "Birds Eye Chicklets - pieces of hen you thought we'd never sell" gets you the sack on the 27th. Avoid oxtail soup. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>AQUARIUS </b><br> (Jan 21-Feb 19) Bit of an ethereal 'hippy' sign, this one. <i>Coronation Street</i>'s Ken Barlowe will pay you a visit with some of his Druid friends and you'll all go for a 'mystic pic-nic' at Stonehenge. Wear flares. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>PISCES </b><br> (Feb 20-Mar 20) You'll have a frightening dream about Billingsgate fishmarket on the 18th. On the 10th you'll go swimming in the sea and get caught m the nets of an Icelandic fishing trawler. You should take more notice of your dreams in future. </font></td></tr></table> <p> <TABLE BORDER=0 ALIGN=center VALIGN=center><tr><td align=right> <TABLE BORDER=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 bgcolor="black" background=""><TR bgcolor="black" background=""><TD><font size=2 color=white><i><b>Doodlebugs</b></i></font></td></tr> <tr><td bgcolor="black" background=""><a href="http://wos.meulie.net/pub/sinclair/./magazines/YourSinclair/Issue33/Doodlebugs/YS33Doodlebugs01.jpg"><IMG SRC="../thumbs/YS33Doodlebugs01.jpg" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=196 ALT="Doodlebugs"></a> </td></tr></table> </td><td></td></tr></table> <p>
