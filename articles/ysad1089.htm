Not a month goes by without a few letters about adventure-writing utilities. <b>J Gow</b> of Fleetwood got a copy of <I>GAC</I> and heard about something called <I>The GACPAC</I>, but what does it do, where is it available and how much? Well, I suppose you want the details. Okay, just this once, but only 'cos I can't find which issue I originally reviewed it in way back in the mists of time. <I>GACPAC</I> contains several programs that improve the performance of GAC. One program makes the most of your memory, and gets over one of <I>GAC</I>'s major faults. This is that if you enter something in the database, and subsequently remove it, <I>GAC</I> removes it from the table but for some reason the memory space it took up is not returned to the user! <I>GACPAC</I> goes through a <I>GAC</I> datafile like a dose of salts and grabs that unused memory, as well as allowing the program to run faster. Another program allows you to load in a finished adventure and save it out as a datafile to load into your own <I>GAC</I> - so you can examine commercial releases and see how they're written. Yet another program gives you 14 different fonts to use in your own programs, and there's also a font designer so you can do your own. And yet another program lets you load in these different fonts, and also add a loading screen at the same time. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not bad, is it? I'd say that no-one writing with <I>GAC</I> can really afford to be without it, especially as it only costs &pound;5.95, is fully documented and comes with a free copy of <I>The Ultimate GAC Guide</I>, a very useful booklet full of advice. <I>The GACPAC</I> was written by The Essential Myth programming team, and is available from them in Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire. They're the authors of CRL's <I>Book Of The Dead</I>, as well as the award-winning <I>Jekyll And Hyde</I>. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Richard Coley</b> of Northants has seen Gilsoft's <I>Quill</I> and <I>Illustrator</I> advertised in YS for only &pound;5.99 the pair. Is it worth it, he asks, and which is the best utility anyway? First, there's no doubt that it's a terrific bargain at that price - when you consider it would have cost you five or six times as much to buy them when they first came out. Later programs like <I>GAC</I> and <I>PAW</I> are better, without a doubt, but you can still produce first rate adventures on <I>The Quill</I>. John Wilson of Zenobi Software still uses it because he knows it so well, and his games earned him the title of Mail Order Software House Of The Year for 1988! Not everyone finds utilities easy to use, so at that price you're not wasting too much money if you find the program beyond you, or you find writing adventures harder work than you thought. The question of cost can't be ignored, and you can also get <I>GAC</I> quite cheaply through the Home Software Club. But which is the best utility? I'd go for <I>PAW</I>, even though it's a bit more expensive, plus the add-on <I>PAW-Phosis</I>. Second choice would be <I>GAC</I> with a copy of <I>GACPAC</I>. Third, but only just, would be a combination of <I>Quill</I>/<I>Illustrator</I> with <I>The Press</I> and other recent enhancements. <I>PAW</I> is way ahead of the field, no doubt, but the quality of the adventures is, in the end, down to the writer, not just how it's written. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard also says he was foolish enough to swop his copy of <I><a href="rigelsrevenge.htm">Rigel's Revenge</a></I> ages ago, and has regretted it ever since, especially now it seems very hard to get hold of. Anyone finished it and want to pass it on? If so, contact Richard. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>IF Duffree</b> of Harlow says that "in <I><a href="kayleth.htm">Kayleth</a></I>, which is very good, I cannot go south after teleporting using Azap code EPO. I break through the wall but then get killed and cannot work out a solution." The answer to that is not to go through it! You do break it at that point, but you cannot get through it safely while you're an android. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Questions of a +3 variety from <b>Angela Cheung</b> from Zummerzet. Firstly, is there a +3 version of the <I>Mortville Manor</I> adventure, published originally for the QL? I've never heard of a Spectrum conversion, but if anyone has come across it then please let Angela know. She also asks for recommended +3 adventures, which I've written to her about, but one that I'd like to mention here is <I><a href="thehermitage.htm">The Hermitage</a></I>, available in a special +3 version from Tony Collins. I have done a full review of this game but unfortunately there hasn't been room to print it. This is a great shame as it's an excellent adventure which earned a personal rating of 8/10 and even a 9/10 for value. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I><a href="thehermitage.htm">The Hermitage</a></I> uses the 'B' side of the disk to store the excellent graphics (8/10). The lengthy text is on the 'A' side with a free bonus adventure, <I>Teacher Trouble</I>. The main game is a gothic tale in which you play the part of a monk, sent on a pilgrimage to distant mountains in order to destroy an evil hermit who some say is the devil incarnate. The text is a bit gory in places, but there's a very strong, atmospheric story, enhanced by those terrific piccies which put Level 9 to shame. If you're looking for an adventure that makes it worth having bought a +3, send for this one. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And blow me down with an aardvark, but here, the very next day, is a letter from <b>Tony Collins</b> himself, author of <I><a href="thehermitage.htm">The Hermitage</a></I>, telling me that he's cut the prices on his game quite a bit. I'll say he has, not so much cut them as hacked them to death! The cost of the 48K version is now just &pound;1.99, the 128K version &pound;2.99 and the +3 version only &pound;4.99. Blimey. If it was 9/10 for value at the original prices, at these the rating shoots off the scale. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>James Doughty</b> of Nottingham asks me about <I><a href="knighttyme.htm">Knight Tyme</a></I>, which is an arcade adventure, so the answer to that is that you should either write to <I>Dr Berkmann's</I> Clinic or check through the Kind Souls in back issues to find someone who's offered help on that game. You might have found Andrew Orwin or John Docherty. And if you'd enclosed an sae, James, I could have told you all that yonks ago! Never mind, I'm sure you'll remember next time. The same goes for <b>James Bloom</b> of Lincoln - send an sae and I'll send you a help sheet to <I>Golden Eggcup</I>. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone who hasn't signed his letter, but who lives in Mid Glamorgan, asks for help on... oh no, not <I><a href="tolkientrilogy.htm">The Hobbit</a></I> again! Yep, there are people still lost in there, and I think it's only our duty to help them get out again. How do you get Elrond to read the map? That's so easy I'm not even going to print it backwards. SAY TO ELROND 'READ MAP'. How do you... yes, here it comes, folks... how do you get out of the Goblins' Dungeon? First you must wait till either Gandalf or Thorin arrives. Then you ask whoever comes first to WODNIW NEPO, and then ask him to EM YRRAC. Then if you're talking to Gandalf ask him to EVAEL, or if it's Thorin WODNIW OG. How do you find the ring? Once you're out of the dungeon and have saved your game, go TSAE/ES/TSAE/ES. Does Beorn ever return to his house? I don't know, and I don't think it matters. How do you get into the forest? Slight confusion here. Beyond Beorn's house there is a location described as 'The Forest', but you just travel through it, you can't ENTER FORFST if that's what you mean. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In return for all this help (just wait till he gets the bill, hee-hee!), this anonymous reader offers advice on <I>The Runes Of Zendos</I>. In fact 15 bits of advice in all, so here are the edited highlights. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To get the corkscrew - KOOC TEERG. To get rid of the butler - WERCSKROC EVIG. To get rid of the maiden - DNOMAID EVIG. To get past Vultus - TAEM EVIG. To kill the werewolf - REGGAD ESU. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was good to hear from <b>Audrey Meredith</b> of Sandycove in Northern Ireland. Chances are you've played one of Audrey's adventures without realising it, as she wrote the story for our Cover Tape freebie, <I><a href="sixinone.htm">Red Door</a></I>, which Tom Frost programmed for Tartan Software. Audrey also wrote the stories for <I><a href="sixinone.htm">Green Door</a></I> and <I>Yellow Door</I>, both on Tartan's <I><a href="sixinone.htm">Six-In-One</a></I> tape. This was all news to me, as Audrey doesn't get a mention anywhere! Oh well, that's life. Audrey's got her own <I>PAW</I>ed game coming out soon, which I'll look forward to seeing, a 128K job called <I>Macabre Laboratory</I>. Sounds tasteful! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile Audrey needs help on <I>Ashkeron</I>. What to do with the executioner and what to do with the tomb are two of the questions. Well, why not EKAT the executioner BMOT EHT OT and ask him to DIL EHT TFIL UOY PLEH? Finally Audrey asks how to get out of the locked room. The answer is that you do what I do every time the postman delivers another sack full of readers' letters: MAERCS DNA DRAOBPUC EHT OTNI TEG. Here he comes now... Arrrgggghhhh!!!!
