Bet you didn't know that my great grandma was Irish, did you? But now you do it probably explains a lot, including the reason why I love Irish place names. I met someone on holiday who comes from Nutt's Corner near Belfast, and my first letter this month is from <b>Bill Campbell</b> of Sallynoggin, County Dublin. Bill's problem, apart from people not believing his address, is to do with <I>Castle Blackstar</I>. He says he was 24 when he started playing it, and he's now 26 and still hasn't finished! Where's the Orb? He wants to know. LENNUT YDNIW EHT NWOD. How do you stop the wind blowing in the windy tunnel? HCTID NI HCTAH ESOLC. But don't forget to open it again before the end of the game. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Irish do have a way with words, don't they? <b>Alan Thorpe</b> from a place called Swords, also in County Dublin, says that he reads my adventure column every week. What, four times in one month? Even I don't read it that often, and I have to check it for mistakes. Oh well, he'd probably been at the Guinness when he wrote in. He says he's got as far as Zelda's lair and the Black Tower in <I>Kentilla</I>, so what should he do next? Pack it in, I'd say, as the game's got bugs in it and you won't be able to finish it anyway. But, in any case, advice isn't as simple as that on this game. The best thing to do is send an sae (or in your case, an International Reply Coupon) and I'll send you a help sheet. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Questions and answers from <b>Paul Appleton</b> of Coventry. The answer is for the reader who wanted to know how to get on to the spaceship in <I><a href="ystop100_2.htm">Popeye</a></I> This bit is forwards, as it's too long to write it all backwards. Climb to the top of the lighthouse, taking care to avoid the fly, walk right, then forwards, then right, and you should now be on a platform. All you have to do then (I love that phrase!) is walk forwards when the spaceship goes past, taking care to time it correctly, and you should be on board. Paul says that if you walk too far forwards you'll fall down and have to do it fall over again, so be warned. In return Paul wants to know a few things about <I><a href="thebalrogandthecat.htm">The Balrog And The Cat</a></I> Paul read in my review of this game that you find the entry form for the races behind the toilet. But where is it? It's there, Paul, it really is, just examine everything in sight, check all the words in all the messages and all the location text. And how to fill it in? Well, I'm not telling you that as you haven't even got it yet, come on! What to do inside the rabbit warren? DAERB HTIW TIBBAR DEEF. What to do with the twigs and coin? Use the coin ENIHCAM OEDIV EHT NO, and as for the twigs, MEHT ERONGI. There are several red herrings in this game, although there's a lot of fun to be had with them just the same - EERT YRATILOS, RETSOP, ENOTS, SGIWT, EXA, PAM. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only does <b>David Aitken</b> forget to give me his address, he can't count either! He says he's got two questions on <I>Play It Again Sam</I>, and then only asks me one. How did the Maths exams go this year, David? What he wants to know is in Part Two of the game, once you've got Gloria's car running, what next? The answer is yet another example of this game's awful parser, as it only accepts the single command YAWA EVIRD. There are umpteen ways of phrasing that, but only one is acceptable to the program. Grrr! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Nic Banister</b> (any relation to Minnie?) says that as I'm such a generous person, could I answer his questions on <I><a href="thepawn.htm">The Pawn</a></I>? Flattery gets you everywhere. But an sae would get you the answers even quicker! How to find Kronos when you've got the dead adventurer's body? First you have to solve the problem of the dragon in the chamber. Where is the key to unlock the door at the top of the ice tower, and where is the voting paper? The ballot paper is EFAS EHT NI, and the key is multi-purpose and can be found LATSEDEP EHT RAEN EHCIN A NI. You have to do something to the pedestal first, mind. If the key ain't there then the adventurer's nicked it! Finally, the alchemist ECIR EHT STNAW. You say you've given him that but still can't get past, in which case I admit I don't know what's stopping you. Any offers? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still in the red rose county, and still on a Magnetic Scrolls game, <b>John Fearon</b> of Bury says that in <I><a href="jinxter.htm">Jinxter</a></I> he's assembled the bracelet and gone upstairs to the hallway, but as soon as he enters one of the doors the game finishes and he's told he's not far enough up the luck scale. As he's got 175 points and is 'incredibly lucky' at that point, what has he done wrong? I'd have to go through the entire game with you to find that out, but if I tell you what the points are awarded for that might help. Five points for getting out of the bus, for getting into the orchard via either the bull or the wire, for getting the spectacles and for making the bracelet. John must have got all those, so it must be one of these tasks that he's missed, all of which earn you ten points - unlocking Xam's mailbox, getting the oil, getting the sack from the gardener, floating the canoe in the lagoon, getting past the mound of dirt, opening the safe, getting on to the girder, getting to the station, getting the ticket, getting on the train, getting to the castle, rescuing Xam, getting out of the cell, opening the dome and finally for getting into Jannedor's sanctum. You also get 15 points for getting rid of the postmistress. Why you don't get ten points for that, too, to make the total a round 2001 don't know. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John also says that he sent off for <I>Jekyll And Hyde</I> from the recent special offer coupons and thinks that it's "brill!" 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A quick thanks to <b>Paul Busow</b> of Liverpool and <b>Martin McKenzie</b> of Glasgow for their advice to people having trouble loading <I>Blzzard Pass</I>. I've already printed this info in the September issue, but in case you missed it you must first go into 128 BASIC, then type OUT 32765,23. This might look like a crash but ignore it, and now type LOAD "" as normal. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My usually reliable readers have let me down recently. You rotten lot! Come on, you can do it. I mentioned in the June issue that reader <b>Alan Biggs</b> of Swindon Village, Cheltenham had got a copy of <I>Ten Little Indians</I> which his daughter had bought for &pound;1.50 in a sale. Unfortunately, when they got it home it turned out not to be a Spectrum version - in fact they can't get it to load on any machine - but the shop wouldn't give them a refund. Surely some kind-hearted reader somewhere has got a Spectrum version of this game that they've finished with and could pass on to Alan? I'm sure he'd even let you have it back when he'd finished solving it. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Stephen Tellam</b> of Plymouth is stuck in <I><a href="frankenstein.htm">Frankenstein</a></I>, and wants to know how to open the chest in the garden - EFINK HTIW SEGNIH WERCSNU. And to escape the bear- ROOLF OTNO PMUJ NEHT EERT BMILC. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>AB Reid</b> of Glasgow isn't a very good adventurer, so they say, and wants to know what to do in the first part of <I>Zacaron Mystery</I> once you've got the crystal. The answer (forwards) is to move the altar, search, search the boat, get the oars, enter the boat (GO BOAT), row the boat and go south, south, west, north. To deal with the hydra in <I>Labours Of Hercules</I> once you've got the burning arrow you should fire it into the cave, then DROWS HTIW DAEH FFO POHC. You've then got one move to HCROT HTIW KCEN NRUB. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Jim Halligan</b> of Liverpool is sinking in <I><a href="adventuregreats.htm">Subsunk</a></I>. How to deal with the overflowing basin, is it something to do with the broom with the sucker on it? Indeed it is, and you're probably looking for the command NISAB EGNULP. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commands are also at the root of the trouble that <I>Wolfman</I>'s causing <b>Yvonne Izzard</b> of Kent. She's got the key, pushed it into the keyhole of the showcase, but it won't open. What's going on? You have to do three things in the right order - YEK EVOMER, YEK HSUP, YEK TRESNI. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Rita Guinness</b> of Staffs writes a multi-coloured missive containing the solution to <I>Mystery Of The Indus Valley</I>, and a warning that she solved it in 65 turns in less than an hour on the same day she bought it! In the unlikely event that anyone's stuck, Rita says that there are only six items you need, the rest are red herrings. The six are MUR, KNALP, EPOR, EFINK, EXAKCIP, HCROT. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More help needed from you lot out there. <b>John Tabtahara</b> bought a copy of <I>The Best Of Beyond</I>, but this didn't include the maps for <I>Doomdark's Revenge</I> and <I>Sorderon's Shadow</I>. If anyone has spare copies John would very much welcome them and be forever in your debt. I'm only helping him 'cos my dad was born in Prescot - see, you're getting the entire family tree this month. More fascinating personal titbits next time round...
