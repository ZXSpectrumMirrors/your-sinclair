I"ve got a new word this month, and the word is <I>SPLUT!</I> You can try saying it backwards but it doesn't improve any. So what's <I>SPLUT!</I> when it's at home? It's a Bristol-based Spectrum fanzine edited by <b>Richard Pelley</b> of Westbury-on-Trym, Bristol. Richard says that to give you an idea of how hopeless he is at adventures, he's still stuck in <I>Planet Of Death</I> after all these years. This is why he's getting someone else to write the adventure section. To get a copy of the latest <I>SPLUT!</I> just send 20p and a stamp. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next letter's also from Bristol, which makes a pair of them. This one's from <b>Garry Lancaster</b>, who gave me some interesting information which is, that I get a credit on the final screen of <I>Doomsday Papers</I>. Do I? (Guess who hasn't finished that adventure then.) Garry's a Play By Mail fan and recommends one from KJC games called <I>Troll's Bottom</I>, but the least said about that the better, I'd have thought. I've enough trouble with <I>Goblins' Dungeons</I> without getting into... 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyone got a copy of an adventure called <I>Journeys End</I> which you're prepared to flog or even give away to someone who's having trouble tracking it down? If so, contact <b>Mrs Hill</b>, Telford, Shropshire. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tony Holmes</b> of London NW1 is stuck right at the end of part one of <I><a href="rigelsrevenge.htm">Rigel's Revenge</a></I>, and asks how to deal with the soldiers who keep saying SLIB - which makes a change from the knight who says NIC. How to deal with them? BMOB EHT DEEN OUY. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Paul Rigby</b> of Liddypool is stuck in the 128K version of <I><a href="thecalling.htm">The Calling</a></I>, and I told him his next step was to insert the charm into the hollow confidently. Paul wrote back to say that he tried INSERT CHARM INTO HOLLOW CONFIDENTLY and nothing happened. No, no, I told him. What I meant was first you MRAHC TRESNI then you "ECNEDIFNOC" YAS. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People write in quite regularly to ask about the photos that you take in <I>Terrormolinos</I>, such as Tim O'Reilly from Staffordshire. Tim's scored 87 percent, but can only find eight pictures: on the beach, at the monastery, at the bull ring, at the wine-tasting, at the plaza, the night club, the boats and the bay. So where are the other two? Both on the beach, you blind or sometink? I can't tell you what they are as I don't know which one you've got, but open your peepers and you should see them. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What no-one can help seeing at the moment is the vast number of bugs in commercial releases, and <b>Ted Webb</b> of Hants has a lot to say on that subject: "When you fork out a tenner for a decent game from a reputable company, you don't expect to have to send it back with your gameplay marred by an unchecked bug. Surely CRL and Adventuresoft have heard of playtesting and bug-checking?" The game in question is <I>Jack The Ripper</I> and the bug occurs in Part 3 when Ted's Speccy seizes up whenever he tries to go into the picturesque garden. I've heard other reports of a <I>Jack The Ripper</I> bug that prevents you completing the game, so that's yet another adventure to add to the bug-box. But thanks anyway to <b>David Moore</b> of Everton for his solution to the first part of that game. Some tips on that one are that when you are in your own room near the start, be sure to TOLS NI NEP TUP. Don't forget to EVAHS A EVAH and to ROOD KCOL. When in the hotel or club location, after your cab ride, you must LLOD HCNERF DAEHEB and GNITNIAP REFICUL EVOM. Password to part two? ENOIMREH LLAC. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lengthy and interesting letter from <b>William McLachlan</b> of Stirling contains another password, this one for Part Two of <I>Play It Again Sam</I>: ENOPAC. The only object you need from Part One is the gun. William's forthright opinion of this game? "So bug-ridden it's hardly worthwhile buying it. If you carry too many objects in part two the game crashes. The worst thing is the taxi. It's not difficult to solve the game, the problem lies in overcoming the bugs." And when starting Part Two of <I><a href="rigelsrevenge.htm">Rigel's Revenge</a></I>, William says to be sure you've got the satchel, screwdriver, stun gun, bomb, uniform and goggles. There were lots more clues from William, and I'd like to thank him for those - I only wish I'd more room to reveal them all. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Gregsy Quinn</b> of Portadown, which is right next door to Portakabin, asks a salty question in <I>Savage Island I</I>. To get some salt (and this is going to be printed forwards, folks, so watch out), take the seater from the tidepool to the hot rocky cliff outside the volcano, pour the water from the bottle to make a puddle and then wait for it to dry out leaving the salt behind. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know why, but that makes me think of <b>Conway The Barbed Hairy-Un</b> of Lambourn, who's written again with some tips for those less fortunate than himself. In <I>Temple Of Terror</I>, you kill the giant centipede with WOBSSORC EHT. In <I><a href="swordsandsorcery.htm">Swords And Sorcery</a></I> before you can go to the Ascension Hall to end the game you need RUOMRA S'BOZ FO SECEIP RUOF. He also asks if I've not heard of one of the first adventures ever, <I>Babbage Quest</I>, which was written for the Analytical Machine in 1882. Honestly, the weird readers we have. I blame the rest of the magazine, they get no encouragement from the very sensible adventure section. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Iwan Davies</b> of Neath claims a Manuel Award, though being stuck in umpteen adventures simultaneously is not enough on its own to earn you the award. I think Iwan sounds like a deserving case though, judging by one of his questions: how do you get into the car in <I><a href="thebigsleaze.htm">The Big Sleaze</a></I>? Well, the input is a bit complicated so I'll print it forwards: GET INTO THE CAR. So there you go then, Manuel Davies. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any adventurers in the Bradford area who are a dab hand with the graphics? If so, contact Jason Micholls. Jason's writing an adventure but needs someone to do the graphics and generally help out. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bit of a moan from <b>Allan Phillips</b> of Camden, not one normally given to moaning, but Allan says he was disappointed with Bug-Byte's <I>STI</I>. Not for the game itself, which he said wasn't bad for a budget release, but for the inlay notes which tell you what part one's all about, and then say "Part two is up to you.." In fact when Allan got to the end of what he thought was part one, all he got was a screen telling him to watch out for part two in the shops. Naughty! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was naughty too the other month when I said that there wasn't a bone in <I><a href="inspectorflukeit.htm">Inspector Flukeit</a></I>. That was because I'd gone and poisoned the dog and thought that readers who said they were looking for bones were definitely barking (ho-ho) up the wrong tree. You'll be barking up the right tree if you can deal with the vicar correctly. He's a bit naughty too, you'll discover. Then investigate the graveyard. <b>Jonathan Borer</b> asked about this, and also how to stop the taxis in <I>Play It Again, Sam</I>. The answer to that one is: IXAT LIAH. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Gary O'Neill</b> of Fife complained that he never sees any tips for <I>Twice Shy</I> in any magazines (not even YS!) What he didn't say, though, was whereabouts he was stuck. <b>James Donaldson</b> of Glasgow was more precise on the same game and said that he's got the tapes and been to the races, so what now? Once you've got the tapes you must DET OT MEHT EVIG. To find out where he is, visit ETIS NAVARAC EHT. As another bit of general advice to Gary, try offering to buy someone a drink fairly early on in the game. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Andrew Tracey</b> of Perivale wants to know about the only adventure game that sounds like a nasal blast, <I><a href="kobyashinaru.htm">Kobyashi Naru</a></I>. To get the shiny object from the clam you need, ECNAL A. Then if you SWAJ NEPO PORP you can MALC OTNI MIWS. To deal with the Krakod you need, DOP EHT. To get the wheel, ETILASAL ETAVITCA. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very pleasing to get a letter from Pete Pointon, author of <I><a href="skelvullyntwine.htm">Skelvullyn Twine</a></I>, thanking me for my encouragement (blush, blush) and letting me know that instead of publishing the game himself it'll now be done by 8th Day Software. Pete admits to a sigh of relief about this, as "you could write everything I know about business on the back of an ant (should you be so inclined!)." Mike White of 8th Day has now offered Pete some graphics work on other projects, and Smart Egg too has told him it might have something. Not bad when all you've produced is a text-only adventure - it tells you how good the loading and introductory graphics must be. And I did like the way Pete ended his letter, "must stop before I get as boring as an icon-driven adventure." 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several readers write in every month asking for help which I could give them if only they'd include sae's with their letters. There isn't room in the column to mention everything, so write again with sae's, Robert Gregson, Jason Knight, Damian Cooper, Chris Delahunty and Brian Squiggly-Signature of Ipswich!
