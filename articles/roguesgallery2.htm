<b>They made us laugh. They made us cry. They made us use words like "wibble". They were, of course, the salty seamen (and seawomen) at the helm of the good ship Your Sinclair, and they steered a bold course through the rocky shallows of the ZX Spectrum lagoon. They were the people who made it happen. Heroes. Scoundrels. Legends. Some claim these intrepid few are merely the half-remembered remnants of some fog-wreathed myth, etched into the primeval human consciousness like King Arthur, Robin Hood or Jeff Minter. Others believe they were the vessels for some benign other-worldly intelligence intent on planting the seeds of global harmony like ET, Starman or Jeff Minter. But they were real. They exist. They live! We found them; we quizzed them. Here's the whole sordid story in their own words...</b>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>What did you do on YS?</b><br> Hacking Away, then Program Pitstop, then reviews, then, apparently, everything. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR><TABLE WIDTH=150 ALIGN="RIGHT"><TR><TD ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="ys94pics/david.jpg"><br><b>David thinks back to the days before jealous bullies smashed his specs</b></TD></TR></TABLE> <b>What have you done since?</b><br> After spells on <i>PC Zone</i> and other computer rags, I managed, somehow, to make the transition from specialist computer-spod writer to proper journalist. Over the last few years, I've written a bunch of articles for <i>Wired</i>, <i>The Guardian</i>, and the BBC about games, technology and drugs. I kept playing games. My eerie skills won me the title UK <i>Doom</i> Champion 1995. I went on to compete in the world deathmatch and lost in the first round to a 14-year-old boy from New Jersey with a moustache. I retired from gaming shortly after. As a musician, I recorded an album, Smoother & Faster, which won a <i>Q Magazine</i> Unsigned Artist award in 1997. It then went on to sell 40 copies. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking the piss, though, is my true love. I wrote and edited <i>seethru.co.uk</i>, the satirical webzine that accompanied the BBC2 drama series <i>Attachments</i>. That was fun. It also featured the short-lived resurrection of Duncan MacDonald writing about his life on the dole in the South Coast Diaries. Currently, I'm writing screenplays that are hilarious in their terribleness. And still doing the odd bit of Web comedy. And whoring myself for the Government and the papers.

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>What is your abiding memory of the Your Sinclair years?</b><br> The coppery excitement of visiting the hallowed YS offices for the first time. 15 years old, I wore a tie and had my mum in tow. Meeting the Gods from the mag - Phil South, T'zer, and Marcus Berkmann - in the flesh. They took me trembling to the pub. I had a shandy. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>Favourite Spectrum game of all time?</b><br> <i>Dragontorc of Avalon</i>. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>Tell us a YS secret that you can now share with the world...</b><br> The competitions were often rigged so friends of staff members won. Very few Program Pitstop programs worked (not my fault!). Having my 15-year-old face in a national magazine did not go down well with my peers at school. My bragging about it all the time didn't help. I was routinely and ruthlessly beaten and still bear the scars today. WARREN McKILWAYNE - I KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE! ONE DAY - WHEN YOU LEAST EXPECT IT... 'SPECCY TWAT' WILL BE COMING...

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><IMG SRC="../jugglers/mike_ger.gif" ALIGN="LEFT"><b><i><font size=+1>MIKE GERRARD</font><br> "I didn't only play adventure games"</i></b><br> <br><b>Your YS nickname?</b><br> Did I have one? I was maybe referred to as the Bearded One, or something like that. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><TABLE WIDTH=160 ALIGN="RIGHT"><TR><TD ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="ys94pics/mike.jpg"><br><b>Mike Gerrard, sans beard, looking a lot less like Matthew Kelly these days</b></TD></TR></TABLE> <b>What did you do on YS?</b><br> Wrote the adventure pages. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>What have you done since?</b><br> Become a travel writer, written three radio plays and shaved off my beard. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>What is your abiding memory of the Your Sinclair years?</b><br> Fun. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>Favourite Spectrum game of all time?</b><br> <i><a href="ystop100_4.htm">Manic Miner</a></i> - just to prove I didn't only play adventure games. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>Tell us a YS secret that you can now share with the world...</b><br> Phil South often worked in the nude. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><IMG SRC="../jugglers/philsout.gif" ALIGN="LEFT"><b><i><font size=+1>PHIL SOUTH</font><br>"I was some kind of small probing creature in the undergrowth, like a shrew"</i></b><br> <br><b>Your YS nickname?</b><br> Snouty. Marcus Berkmann started that one, because I was always nipping out for a pack of cigarettes, and being as this was London we were fond of prison slang, so I would always say "just going out for some snouts", and it kinda stuck. Plus I think there was some joke about my nose, and it made it sound like I was some kind of small probing creature in the undergrowth, like a shrew or something. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>What did you do on YS?</b><br> I was the Staff Writer but later on the Technical Editor. I would do hardware reviews mostly but also my fair share of game reviews as did anyone we could grab who happened to be passing. As the years rolled on it was odd how many people happened to be passing all the time. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>What have you done since?</b><br> I wrote a game with John Molloy called <i><a href="fish.htm">Fish!</a></i> for Magnetic Scrolls. After YS I moved out of London and landed in Frome in Somerset. A huge amount of writing - technical books on <i>AMOS</i> and other Amiga topics, plus writing and editing books on <i>Lightwave 3D</i>. After that I became a computer graphics and 'new media' guru, making websites for corporations. After a bit of bad luck my business went down the pan, so I had to go looking for a job, and got a really good one at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School, maintaining the computers, designing programmes and posters, and teaching film and video studies. It's one of the most respected drama schools in the world, and I'm honoured to be part of the family. Plus I get to be a film-maker half the time which has always been my dream. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><TABLE WIDTH=190 ALIGN="RIGHT"><TR><TD ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="ys94pics/panto.jpg"><br><b>That's Phantom Phil and Mingey Marcus behind all that slap</b></TD></TR></TABLE> <b>What is your abiding memory of the Your Sinclair years?</b><br> It has to be the time we did a panto spread one year. Pete Shaw and some of his buddies from the Madame Jo-Jo's gay piano bar made Marcus and I dress up as panto dames, except we looked more like drag queens for obvious reasons. It was a funny spread - I nearly popped a vein in my skull at the time laughing. Oh, and the time I was sitting there on my own one morning, at about 8am, in our office right behind the reception area, and a car came crashing through the front window. Fortunately the receptionist was making coffee in the back at the time, and the only casualty was my nerves. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>Favourite Spectrum game of all time?</b><br> Oh man, so many games! It's a toss up between <i><a href="tetris.htm">Tetris</a></i>, <i><a href="headoverheels.htm">Head Over Heels</a></i> or <i><a href="sentinel.htm">The Sentinel</a></i>. I think <i><a href="sentinel.htm">The Sentinel</a></i> was a work of genius, by far the furthest extension of the game makers art at that time. I mean how in blue blazes do you fit all that <i>game</i> into 48Kb? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>Tell us a YS secret that you can now share with the world...</b><br> On the whole I think the lid should stay on that particular box. Outing all the gay guys has been done, saying that I was in love with every female art editor I ever worked with is both a no brainer and obvious because I'm so transparent and juvenile. The people who were total bastards to work with... don't exist, as most people were kind, professional, scarily smart and lovely people to be around. It was the time of my life and I think most people who lived through that era would say that if a meteor had crashed through YS while we were working there (instead of some silly woman who couldn't drive her car) we would have died happy.
