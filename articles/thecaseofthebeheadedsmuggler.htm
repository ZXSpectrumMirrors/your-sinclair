<div>We've had quite a few Sherlock 
Holmes send-up adventures 
over the past year, so it's good 
to see someone going back to 
the original character and 
producing a terrific adventure as a result 
- knowing that the Sherlock character 
and stories are safely out of copyright, of 
course. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a two-part text-only adventure, 
so how come there are four programs on 
the tape? Elementary, my dear readers. 
The first prog's an intro and the last 
prog's a free bonus adventure called 
<I>Yuppie</I>. This revolves around a day in the 
life of an aspiring yuppie, Nigel Ffoulkes-Smythe. It's amusingly done, and 
raised a few chuckles from me. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intro program, which is written in 
Basic, loads up a menu from which you 
can choose several options. There are 
the credits and some brief adverts (and 
no, I don't mean they're adverts for 
briefs!), with lists of some of the 
commands each adventure understands. 
Useful in <I>Smuggler</I> will be X for 
examine, Z to wait, ALL commands, 
FIND (another character), TALK TO/QUESTION/ACCUSE (another 
character), TS/TL for tape save/load and 
RS/RL for RAM save/load. <I>Yuppie</I> has 
even more interesting commands, like 
PROPOSE, REMOVE and INSERT, 
though sadly I didn't get far enough into 
the adventure to try those out. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back at <I>Smuggler</I>, the scene-setting 
story is a really well-written piece, an 
extract from Dr Watson's casebook that's 
full of the feeling of the original Holmes 
stories. In fact it reads to me like it must 
have come from a real Conan Doyle story 
- either that or programmer Patrick 
Walsh is very good at pastiche (this 
month's big word). 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the intro you meet Victor Wathley, 
who's consulting Holmes about his 
uncle, George Wathley. George has been 
a tea-importer for 20 years, and is a very 
wealthy man, though Victor suspects the 
wealth may have more to do with 
importing opium, alcohol and other such 
stuff than just the old PG Tips. But he 
also suspects that someone has a hold on 
his uncle, and is forcing him to do this, 
so he wants to know if Holmes can help. 
He shows Sherlock a note he found at his 
uncle's house on a recent visit, which 
says 'REMEMBER JOHNSON, YOU 
WILL GET THE SAME'. Holmes recalls 
the recent murder of Nathaniel Johnson, 
whose body had a note attached which 
showed two crossed swords. This is the 
symbol of the Fellowship of the Swords, 
a masonic-like society. Holmes arranges 
to meet Victor at his uncle's house in 
Horsham, where they then find the 
decapitated body of the uncle lying in a 
pool of blood. Your task as Holmes is to 
find the killer, the weapon and the 
motive. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On loading up the first part, it's 2pm 
and there you are outside Wathley's 
country house with Watson, Victor and a 
headless corpse at your feet. Don't tread 
in the blood, it could be evidence. 
Watson finds a button and a note on the 
body - the note, needless to say, has 
two crossed swords on it. Victor runs off 
to fetch the fuzz, leaving you and Watson 
to explore. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the entrance hall you find a walking 
stick, with an ivory tip and a top that's 
encrusted with diamonds. This suggests 
robbery wasn't the motive, though the 
stick requires a close examination. A fire 
is still burning in the grate, so the crime 
must have been fairly recent. If you can 
find the secret room, which is none too 
difficult, you will unearth a diary which 
explains quite a lot about what's been 
going on. You also trigger off an amusing 
little message, where Watson's startled 
by a spider that runs up his trouser leg. 
As you point out what it is he brushes it 
off "and tries to regain his usual air of 
dignity". There are quite a few of these 
random messages which add to the 
enjoyment of the game. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I played further into it, I found it 
very slightly disappointing - not that it's 
bad, not at all, just that I think more 
could have been made of it, when so 
much trouble has been taken with the 
story background. There aren't too many 
problems, and those that are there are 
comparatively easy - more a case of 
examining objects to find clues, and 
watching your score slowly mount up. 
You hope. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This certainly didn't put me off the 
game, but it shows the difficulty of 
adapting a Holmes-like investigation into 
an adventure game. It can be done, but I 
think you need a bit of problem-solving 
to your evidence-gathering. It's a 
different approach to an adventure game, 
I suppose, as you're faced more with the 
way things would be in the real world  -
a lot of objects to examine and to see 
what you can make of them, rather than 
just trying to get through locked doors, 
although there's one of those for you too! 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's also the traditional adventure 
bug, which I hope the author sorts out. 
In Wathley's bedroom, if you open the 
wardrobe you're told there's a coat 
inside, which then appears in the 
location description. Try to GET COAT, 
and you're informed that it ain't there! GET 
COAT FROM WARDROBE? Nope. 
ENTER WARDROBE? Nope. EXAMINE 
COAT, WEAR COAT? OPEN 
WARDROBE, CLOSE WARDROBE? 
Nope, can't be done. I checked the hint 
sheet I'd been given, which suggested it 
would be useful to me if I got something 
from Wathley's wardrobe. I wish I could. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assuming that bug's sorted out, this'll
be an excellent game to play as what I 
saw of the rest of it was perfectly bug-free. The inclusion of a few tougher 
problems would have improved it, but it 
still rates very highly for entertainment 
value and professionalism. It's the first 
time I've heard of Patrick Walsh and 
Mental Image, but if <I>The Case Of The 
Beheaded Smuggler</I>'s anything to go by it 
won't be the last.
