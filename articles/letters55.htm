<b> Er, I'd better warn you in advance that I may be a little bit 'tetchy' this month - I'm rather sunburnt you see - and, as a result, in a considerable amount of pain. Yaaaarrgghhh, I just accidentally scraped my back on a nail sticking out of the bit of the shed behind my desk. Arrgghh, aaarghhh, loads of skin has come off!! Aaaarggh! Right onto you lot! (Aaaargghh!) </b> <p> <font size=4><b> UH-OH....</b></font><br> I am writing in response to the letter in the May issue from Mr Sam Jeffreys. I have not corresponded with a magazine before but I feel that Mr Jeffreys is correct and deserves support from all like-minded readers who, as you know, do have a choice. Like him, I must express my dismay at the journalistic direction you seem to be taking. Until I read his letter I thought I was the only one who.......!! <i>(The only one who what??? Ed)</i> Now Sam knows he is not alone, and perhaps others may write to you on this same subject. Please, please, give us readers what we want in future. MORE computing science articles. Less comic cuts. Some utility programs on a Cover Tape or 3.5" MGT disk. If you want to take early retirement we will be sorry to see you go, our loss would be Canada's gain. The Spectrum has many colours, or differing shades, that make the whole, so a magazine editor must reflect all good values more in keeping with those high traditions of journalism. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that I've had my say, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Things will get better I pray, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For things can't get worse, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or other readers too may curse, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just for Sam and I, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put on your thinking cap, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cut out the trivia right now 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks a lot, old chap! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They say if you can't stand the heat stay out of the kitchen. Is that why the cold climate in Canada appeals to you, I wonder? <br> <b> Mr PJ Breslin <br> Plymouth, Devon <br> </b> <br><i> Look, do you want a fist fight or something? And no, it's not the cold climate that appeals to me - like I said, I just want to go somewhere where there are raccoons and friendly grizzly bears. Anyway, just to be democratic, I'll put something to the vote - in a couple of months I'm thinking of doing a totally serious 45 page feature on the Spectrum 128K sound chip (with a further four pages of complicated graphs thrown in for good measure). Write either "Yes please" or "No, don't do it!" on the back of a post card and send it in. We'll sort this out once and for all. <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> WEIRD</b></font><br> Hello! I'm a French <i>YS</i> fan, and I have to protest! You are always say that French are weird! Yes, you say that French are WEIRD! And I prove that... 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><center><a href="../thumbs/letters/big/55a.jpg"><IMG SRC="../thumbs/letters/55a.jpg"></a></center><p> 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I prefer not to mention the name of the author of that. <i>(It was Dunc actually. Ed)</i> Okay, if you speak of Vanessa Paradis, you're right. But except that, I don't know why French are weird. Oh, I suppose it's because we are eating frogs and snails! But it's very good. (If you want, I invite all the team of <i>YS</i> into France and I cook you some snails and some frogs with butter and parsley.) <i>(Er, no thanks. Ed)</i> Well, I hope you stop to say French are weird and now you will say that French are fantastic. <i>YS</i>, stay the best for me, and you will become the best of the best if you put a football game soon in a Smash Tape - or if we have a graphic adventure in French. <br> <b> Kevin Berthier <br> St Consorce, France <br> </b> <br><i> Well, what with 1992 and the Channel Tunnel and all that, I suppose I really ought to bite my lip hard and say that, yes, the French are fab. But I'm not going to. Especially as when I was on holiday recently a rather scary wrinkled woman accosted me in Champery and told me she could see into the future and that the car I was driving was going to explode and burn me to death. Was it a joke? Or are the French weird? Maybe a bit of both. Oh, all right then, the French are weird in a fantastic sort of a way. Happy now? <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> IGNORED CHICKS</b></font><br> How do you win the way to the hearts of computer-mad boys who take no notice of anything else? We are sick and tired of being ignored. We even sit down with our skirts half-way up our thighs and still they stare at the screen. <i>(Blimey. Ed)</i> So how do you get through to a human being who talks computer jargon all the time? Please help. <br> <b> Meryl Streep and Meg Ryan <br> Starbridge, West Midlands <br> </b> PS Thanks to CJ of Australia for the info on what's going to happen in <i><a href="neighbours.htm">Neighbours</a></i>, but we can't stand the program, so can he tell us anything about <i>Home And Away</i> instead? <br> PPS And we'd like two badges, because the boys might take some notice then. <br> <br><i> Maybe you're not being obvious enough. Give the lads a smacker on the lips (a kiss that is, not a clenched fist). A snog-up isn't the sort of message that can be ignored - their computers will be immediately turned off, I virtually guarantee it. Oh, and regarding </i>Home And Away<i> - Alex Papps gets killed in a forest fire and widowed Nicolle Dixon ends up marrying Peter Vroom (ie Lance). <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> GASSED</b></font><br> This letter contained an unknown poisonous gas. You now have only 27 days to live. However, if you print this letter I will send you the antidote. <br> <b> Tristan Moss <br> Cirencester, Glos <br> </b> PS Love the mag, by the way. <br> <br><i> I couldn't care less about the gas - Andy opened the mail this month, you see, Mind you, I'd be obliged if you could send the antidote anyway - after all, it costs a bomb advertising for new staff members these days. <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> COUPE CONNECTION</b></font><br> Recently you will have received a letter telling you of a User Group called the Coupe Connection. We have recently heard from MGT that Coupe is a trademark of theirs and so we are taking legal advice on the subject. We therefore wish that you do not call us the Coupe Connection until you hear from us further. However, we would still appreciate you mentioning the PD library if you would, but please do not call us the Coupe Connection. <br> <b> JP Hemmings <br> Old Windsor, Berks. <br> </b> <br><i> You old Coupe Connection, you! <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> TO THE DEFENCE</b></font><br> Who is this Sam Jeffreys person? He says that computing is an art and a science, and he is right - but what other Sinclair mag contains regulars like <i>Rage Hard</i> and <i>Program Pitstop</i>? I mean, he says that you have dirty articles and that you feature "evil" games. Aaargh!! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All right, so the only review I could find in issue 53 which was not involved with injuring or killing things was <i><a href="klax.htm">Klax</a></i>, and <i>YS</i> would not be very exciting with only one review in it. If he's going to complain to anyone it should be the software houses. I'm sure you could modify <i>YS</i> to Sam's standards, but it would mean cutting the readership from over 70,000 to 3 (and that's including Matt's mum and a spare copy for back issues). He thinks you shouldn't be at the number one slot - so who should? A gutter fanzine run by a rabid teddy bear? Or an advertising leaflet with a tape of very old games on the front? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Answer that, Sam. The only thing that's blackened the name of Sinclair is that it was bought by Amstrad. And what's a horrible picture, for heaven's sake? All the covers and inside artwork are brilliant, with a great picture rounding up a game featured inside, or a humorous cartoon to liven the pages up a bit. What do you want, Sam? Circuit diagrams? Or maybe illustrations from the original Noddy books? Listen, Sam, you blacken the name of the Coupe! <br> <b> Matthew Zavian Holland <br> Aylesbury, Bucks <br> </b> <br><i> Circuit diagrams! Brilliant, I hadn't thought of that. You know I was going on about the issue with 45 pages dedicated to the sound chip and four pages of graphs? Well, how about 30 circuit diagrams in black and white as well? As I said, on a post card please. <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> CRAP DOG</b></font><br> I was sorting out my cupboard searching for my old copies of <i>YS</i> when I found <i><a href="redoctober.htm">The Hunt For Red October</a></i>. I loaded the game up and was instantly shot in the backside by torpedos - I think I need a POKE or a solution. Anyway, I think your mag is great. Oh, and if you don't publish this letter you may have to run rather fast as I will be setting my alsation onto you. <br> <b> Jim Clark <br> Addlestone <br> Weybridge <br> </b> <br><i> You don't honestly think anybody is scared of alsations anymore do you? They're right down at the bottom of the 'terrifying canine creature league' in about 23rd place - along with golden retrievers and things. Bull mastiffs and rotweillers are the real business nowadays (although you can still sort them out if you've got a big enough iron bar. With a spike on the end). <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <TABLE align=center BORDER BGCOLOR=white BACKGROUND=""><TR><TD> <FONT SIZE=6><B><U>STAR LETTER</U></b></font><br>Hello. I have a question. Why do English cartoonists (ie in your mag) always draw underpants like this... 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><center><a href="../thumbs/letters/big/55b.jpg"><IMG SRC="../thumbs/letters/55b.jpg"></a></center><p> 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody wears that kind of underpants down here! The modern Dutch pair of underpants nowadays looks like this... 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><center><a href="../thumbs/letters/big/55c.jpg"><IMG SRC="../thumbs/letters/55c.jpg"></a></center><p> 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be because the cultural development in England is 100 years behind ours (eg acid on French fries). 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, now I understand why you dribbling on with that pathetic 'Holland, land of the clog' joke - you must think the Dutch culture is stuck in the Middle Ages, like yours! <br> <b> Martin Van Spanje <br> Heemstede <br> Holland <br> </b> PS If you mention the words 'clog', 'tulip', '(wind)mill', '(Edam) cheese', 'chocolate' or 'dyke' in your answer I'll send my mother round to bash you up. <br> <br><i> Um, obviously the word 'sexy' has rather a different meaning in the Land of the Clog/Tulip/Windmill/Edam Cheese/Chocolate/Dyke/Underpants from what it does over here. (By the way, what's chocolate got to do with Holland? That's Belgium, isn't it?) Still, you can have the Star Letter, but only if you promise to send us a sample pair of the remarkable 'modem Dutch pair of underpants' (new, of course) so we can see what they're all about for ourselves. <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> </td></tr></table><p> <TABLE align=center BORDER BGCOLOR="#208020" BACKGROUND=""><TR><TD><center><font size=6><b>THE WONDERFUL WORLD OF SPECCY</b></font></center><p> <b>More letters from around the globe... </b> <p> <font size=4><b> TWO COMPLAINTS</b></font><br> I allow two complaints - in my <i>YS</i> 52 there isn't the Smash Tape.

In the last column of the <i>YS</i>/Incentive/Domark Compo it says "Bung your name and address on the coupon, chop it out and sick it on the back of a postcard". I think you meant "stick". I mean, you don't really expect us to spew up or something do you? <br> <b> Ben Fryer <br> St Helens <br> Merseyside <br> </b> <br><i> Um, that was the general idea actually, yes. We were trying to save you wasting loads of money on expensive bonding agents (everyone knows how firm congealed vomit gets). Still, you probably won't believe me, so you can have a Trainspotter. <b>Ed.</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> E=MC2</b></font><br> I hereby claim a Trainspotter award for your condition of erring in judgement concerning your preview of <i><a href="emotion.htm">E-Motion</a></i> in the April issue in which you stated that Einstein's equivalence of the mass and energy equation, E=MC2, was formulated by him in the 1950s. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The equation appeared in his special theory of relativity published in 1905. This theory explained the Michelson/Morley experiment of 1887 in which the speed of light is always 299,792,458 m/s-1 irrespective of the measuring body's motion. It also shows that there is no absolute standard of time and that nothing can travel faster than light because from the equation it would take an infinitely massive body an infinite amount of energy (since matter is stored energy) to reach the speed of light. This theory, however, was inconsistent with Newtonian gravity which assumes that gravitational effects travel at an infinite speed, ie the effect of an alteration in the gravitational field of one body would be instantaneously recognised by everything else. In 1915 Einstein published his infamous general theory of relativity which suggested that gravity is not a force in its assumed understanding, but simply a consequence of four dimensional space-time being curved. A practical example of this is the orbit of the Earth around the Sun. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earth does not follow a curved orbit, it travels in a straight path through four dimensions. Since space-time is curved, in three dimensional space (as we see the universe) the orbit of the Earth and other planetary bodies appears curved. Also this curvature is affected by the mass and energy contained in the universe. Because of this a distant star appears to move around considerably when it's in the line of sight of a closer massive body. The increase in space-time curvature near this body appears to bend the beam of light from the star in three dimensions. In actual fact the light beam doesn't bend at all, it just appears to because of this increase in the curvature of four dimensions near this body. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Referring back to my original point though, you may possibly be confused with Einstein's death in 1955. <br> <b> Professor 'Joplin The Strippit <br> Operator' PhD <br> Eastleigh, Hants <br> </b> <br><i> Sorry, I wasn't really listening. Can you say all that again? Actually I drifted off around the second paragraph - and I think you were saying something about how nothing can go faster than the speed of light. Ha!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is my rap and it goes like this.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I started buying <i>YS</i> about a squillion years ago,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Dear Bud Pico <br>I would just like to say how grateful I am to you after the advice you offered me in issue 50. Following your suggestion of sprinkling Rice Krispies around all our doors and windows we attracted an extra house guest. It was an exceedingly rare Naked Mole Rat (Heterocephalus Glaber) which had been on loan to the local zoo but had escaped! My husband returned it and for our efforts we received a very generous reward. We now have a new burglar alarm and enough left over for a big meal at a local restaurant.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Dear Bud <br>Thanks for the advice you offered me recently in your excellent publication.
