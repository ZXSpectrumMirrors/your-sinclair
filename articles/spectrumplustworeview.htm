Sneaking up on the "Sinclair" stand at this year's PCW show/madhouse, I couldn't find what I was looking for. True enough, the Sinclair ZX Spectrum +2 was there. Just like everyone's been saying since Amstrad bought out Sinclair all those moons ago. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I prised a +2 from where it had been nailed to the table. It wasn't underneath it. It wasn't bolted to the end or sticking out the back. It wasn't even inside. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It might well be an Amstrad. But it hasn't got a stigma attached to it. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big A's done a pretty good job of tarting up the late and great Speccy 128. &pound;150 gets you a 128 in a nice grey case and somewhat less change than you'll need for the bus home. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's got an Amstrad-style built-in cassette deck to reduce the chances of accidentally strangling the cat with all those leads. In theory, it's more reliable too and you don't even have to faff with a volume control. But be warned - there's no tape counter, which is less of a good idea. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The keyboard's much improved. Amstrad's made the big decision to wipe off all the old Basic keywords so not only does it feel better, it looks better. Bit of a problem when you come to program in 48K Basic mode though. You can't see what you're doing. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two built-in joystick ports too though Amstrad has done the dirty and made sure you can't use them with anybody else's joysticks. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only other new thingy is a sound socket on the back to let you get the sound out when there's a monitor plugged in. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Software wise not a lot's changed either. The copyright messages now mention this funny new company and the 128's <I>Tape Tester</I> has been suppressed. Otherwise - all the same. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The +2 runs everything the 128 does. So it will work with many 48K tapes (in 48K mode) and the slowly growing pile of 128K mode taps. Amstrad is plonking a 'Sinclair Quality Control' sticker on all the games it has tested and warns you to beware of anything that hasn't got one. However, if it says it will go on a 128, it'll go on the +2. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it works the other way round. All those tapes and hardware bits - like ZX Printers, disk drives, RGB adapters and so on - that don't go on the 128, won't go on the +2 either. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All-in-all, it's got to be a goer. The +2 should give thousands of new people the ideal opportunity to get into Speccy computing - be prepared for an invasion. Best of all, it's gonna give the software houses the final excuse they need to get on with producing decent 128 software. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>The Manual</b><br> Now we're talking real manuals here! This one's got all the techie stuff as well as great quantities of the original Spectrum's Vickers/Bradbeer masterpiece. All the new stuff is pretty well written too and there's a decent index. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>A Sticky Problem</b><br> At long last, a Speccy with a built-in joystick port - two in fact! They're compatible with the Sinclair/Interface II protocol which most games can handle (although Kempston is still the more popular). 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What they're not compatible with is any joystick except the thing pictured here - the new Sinclair/Amstrad SJS1. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, this little bit of sabotage won't stop all the Speccy's add-on makers. Already, new joysticks are arriving with twin plugs for both old Speccys and the +2. Cheetah also has an adapter to let you use your normal joystick. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, we suspect, it wouldn't take a genius to prise open a Quickshot and do a quick re-wire. Let you know when we've tried it... 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>FAX BOX</b><br> News from Amstrad says that the +2 will sell for &pound;149 and the SJS1 joystick for about &pound;12. However, some shops will be selling the machine, the joystick and six games for &pound;159.95. What a bargain!
