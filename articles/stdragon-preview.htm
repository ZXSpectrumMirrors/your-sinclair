<div><b>Remember our giant shoot-'em-ups 
guide from a couple of issues back? 
(Snazzy, wasn't it?) We raved on about 
Activision's <I><a href="rtype.htm">R-Type</a></I> conversion a bit, 
didn't we? (Hardly surprising really - it is 
one of the best Speccy shoot-'em-ups 
ever!) Well, <I>St Dragon</I>, from new 
software label Storm, looks just the same 
- but with knobs on! MATT BIELBY just 
had to pop along to investigate! </b>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's quite a bit of explaining to be done 
right here at the beginning so you'll know 
what I'm wobbling on about, but I'm not 
going to do it. Pop over to the 'What On Earth 
Is...?' bit at the end if you're confused about 
Jaleco, Storm or whatever, but otherwise we'll 
dive in head-first - you'll have to pick things up 
as best you can as we go along. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right, to the game itself. A picture's worth 
a squillion words (or so they say) so it might be 
wise to take a few ganders at the screens <I>[Or, in our case, screen... - NickH]</I>
before we go any further. Back already? 
Okay. What did you manage 
to work out? If you said it's a 
horizontally-scrolling shoot-'em-up, then you're 
absolutely right (but I'm hardly impressed). A 
horizontal scroller with little space ships in it? Yes, 
okay. And one with a nifty metallic look to 
everything? Getting warmer, but I think you're 
missing something. Look, what if l was to tell you 
there's a giant alien spaceship on one level that 
more than fills the screen (and which you have to 
fly all the way around, destroying one bit at a 
time)? Sounds familiar yet? Yes! It's an 
unashamed <I><a href="rtype.htm">R-Type</a></I> clone, isn't it!? (But - I hasten 
to add - one of the best yet!) Hurrah!! 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, at first glance, <I>St Dragon</I> really does 
look just like <I><a href="rtype.htm">R-Type</a></I> with knobs on. Or rather, with 
a tail on. You see, your little spaceship is a wiggly 
dragon/snake-shaped doobrie, the tail being far 
more invulnerable than the head of the ship, so 
you can sort of wrap it round yourself when you're 
in real trouble, giving a similar degree of 
protection to the droid/ball thing you could stick 
on the front or back of your ship in <I><a href="rtype.htm">R-Type</a></I>. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plot is of the standard 'quest against an evil 
empire' sort (though in this case you've got to 
rescue a giant space-dragon from the baddies) 
and that's really all you need to know. Oh yes, 
except (of course) that things really have moved 
on a-pace from the original <I><a href="rtype.htm">R-Type</a></I>, and the 
baddies in <I>St Dragon</I> do much more interesting 
and complicated things. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, want to know more? Then come with me, 
let's nip on a train down to London (unless you 
live there already of course, in which 
case you can meet me at the station), 
make our way to the swank(ish) Storm 
offices near Clapham Junction, and take 
a gander for ourselves. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>A chat with the crew </b><br>
Dan Marchant is the software manager in 
charge of this project, so let's have a word 
with him first. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi, Dan! How's is going, matey? 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Really well, actually. We've at last got a lot 
(though by no means all) of the graphics sorted, 
so things are starting to really come together. Up 
until now, instead of spaceships, we had all these 
rubbishy little sprites drawn by the programmer 
whizzing around all over the screen, including little 
messages like 'I can't draw' standing in for baddies 
and things. In fact (by a spooky coincidence) the 
programmer's just over there. He's called Andy 
Taylor. Why don't we pop over and talk to him? </I>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And why not? What a splendid idea! Hello, you 
must be Andy. How's it going? 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Oh, okay actually. We've at last got Virgin's 
</I>Judge Dredd<I> out of the way (the last game I 
programmed), so I'm concentrating totally on </I>St 
Dragon<I> at the moment. I've just returned to 
programming actually - </I>Dredd<I> was the first since 
some Codies budgie stuff about four years ago. I've 
been in Germany and all sorts since then. Sean 
McClurg (yes, like Doug McClurg from </I>The Virginian<I> 
and all those crappy monster films, fact-fans), did 
the graphics (he's an old budget man too) and I 
think Tony Williams will do the music. </I>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brillo. Any big problems with it?

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Well, we realised quite early on that we'd 
never get it all in 48K, so it's 128-only game I'm 
afraid. You could call that a problem if you're a 
humble 48K Speccy owner.</I> 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should cocoa! What else? 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Well, the sprite system caused some probs too - 
there are some huge sprites in here, some half the 
size of the screen, which use up a vast amount of 
memory. The other thing is that in </I>St Dragon<I> each 
alien seems to make a much more complicated 
series of moves than in, say, </I>R-Type<I>, so we've got to 
try and reproduce them all, which is pretty 
complicated. That's all the really difficult stuff, I think. 
The rest was just very hard. </I>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Erm, righty-ho.

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>SO WHAT ON EARTH IS... <br>
... Storm? </b><br>
A-ha! Now you're asking. Well, it's a software 
house, isn't it, and the reason you've never heard 
of it before is because it's new. Or rather, it's sort 
of new. You see, the company and people 
behind Storm have been around for quite a while 
now, it's just that they've always been a bit 
behind the scenes. Their proper name is actually 
The Sales Curve, and they're a bunch of 
programming and marketing people who've got 
very close ties with Accolade in the UK (in fact, 
they share the same offices), have produced hit 
games like <I>Silkworm, Ninja Warriors</I> and the 
upcoming <I><a href="judgedredd.htm">Judge Dredd</a></I> for Virgin in recent(ish) 
months, and are generally rated by 'those who 
know' as being worth watching over the next six 
months or so - they could well be rather 'big'. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>...Jaleco? </b><br>
Well, they're the coin-op people who came up 
with the original <I>St Dragon</I> machine, and they're 
fairly unknown too. Besides <I>St Dragon</I>, you may 
have seen their Porsche rally game <I>Big Run</I>, which 
allowed you to link up a series of machines to 
play your friends (we covered it in <I>Slots Of Fun</I> last 
year) or the super-sickly-cute <I><a href="rodland.htm">Rodland</a></I>, which is 
like <I><a href="bubblebobble-69.htm">Bubble Bobble</a></I> crossed with <I>My Little Pony. St 
Dragon</I> will be the first of their games to be 
converted to the Speccy (that we can think of at 
least - let us know if we're wrong) but (spook!) the 
other two will be done by Storm later in the year. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>...Dan Marchant? </b><br>
He's just this blond bloke who works at The Sales 
Curve and who supervised the development of <I>St 
Dragon</I>. You don't need to worry about him too 
much. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b><I>ST DRAGON</I>, STAGE BY STAGE </b><br>
Okay, Dan, can we go through all the different levels and 
the differences between them? 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>Level One</b><br>
Sure thing. Okay, this first level (the one you can see in the 
Screenshots <I>[or not, as the case may be - NickH]</I>) is set over the surface of some alien planet. The 
baddies are of the mechanical crab, larvae, snake and insect 
vadety in the main - someone took weeks going through the 
coin-op giving names to them all and working out all their 
individual abilities! - but towards the end of the level you get the 
most spectacular baddies, which are these giant mechanical 
pumas, which leap at you and are very hard to kill. End-of level-guardian is a giant (mad) cow with rockets for feet. Bizarre! 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>Level Two</b><br>
This one's in a sort of alien jungle, populated with mechanical 
jellyfish, butterfly and <I><a href="rtype.htm">R-Type</a></I> snake Iookalikes. There are some 
laser-firing rocks in here too, a wraith thing (which is like an evil 
mirror-image version of yourself), and a bizarre flying saucer at 
the end that splits in half and shoots a weird pattern of stars all 
over the place. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>Level Three</b><br>
This is more your traditional <I><a href="rtype.htm">R-Type</a></I>-style tunnel affair. There are 
slugs crawling along the floors and ceilings, giant laser ships that 
almost block your path, a bizarre thing that bounces along on 
one foot (and looks like a robotic version of one of those 
cartoons from <I>Monty Python</I>), and a rather indescribable end-of-level monster. What, you really want me to try and describe it 
to you? Oh, alright. It's sort of like an alien from, er, <I><a href="ystop100_4.htm">Alien</a></I>, 
trapped in a test tube. The tube splits open, and it shoots fireballs 
which move in a sort of maze pattern, creating a weird network 
of flames which you've got to avoid. Actually, I find it totally 
impossible, this bit. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>Level Four</b><br>
This is set in space, with the baddies including alien spaceships 
that appear to be totally made up out of tubes. The end-of-level 
monster looks like an upside-down bath tub (or perhaps one of 
those old Mallard steam trains) and drops from the top of the 
screen, before spewing out various horrible, um, 'thingies'. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>Level Five</b><br>
We're not sure if we'll be able to do this one in the Speccy 
version yet, but, if we do, it's the one with a giant alien 
spaceship you have to fly around, making sure you don't get 
crushed at the edges of the screen, frazzled by the rocket 
motors or shot to pieces by the various gun eraplacements. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>Level Six</b><br>
A space port level with giant cranes and so on to avoid, big drill 
heads that drop from the ceiling, and a giant baddie that 
consists of loads of stars that bounce around the screen. One 
neat touch on this level is that you can see a massive graphic of 
the trapped dragon you've got to rescue (which looks like an 
organic, and five hundred times bigger, version of yourself) 
revealed slowly behind you as you progress. Finish the game, 
and you get a final screen of the two dragons flying off the 
planet together. (Well, you do in the arcade version anyway!)
