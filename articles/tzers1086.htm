It was a hot and sultry day. The air was still and nothing stirred around me. I gazed wistfully across the meadow (well, the <I>YS</I> office actually), a crystal tear sliding down my cheek. Suddenly, a dark horse and rider appeared on the horizon, his mane flowing over his lithe body - I do wish the Ed would get his hair cut. He'd come to tell me that it's T'zers time again. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A shrill high-pitched sound broke the silence. I grabbed the heaving telephone, trembling as I spoke, "Hhhh-ello." "Hi there, it's Richard Tisdall from US Gold." I swooned. Could this be news of new US Gold games? "Hey, there are simply millions of things I want to tell you if only I could find the words. I'll come straight to the point. US Gold has licensed some really big arcade games for Christmas. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"First of all, there's <b><a href="gauntlet.htm">Gauntlet</a></b>, based on the successful arcade game. You've got to survive monster attacks for as long as possible whilst trying to find food, treasure and magic potions. And what's more there's even a two player option. Other licensed products are <b><a href="expressraider.htm">Express Raider</a></b> and <b><a href="breakthru.htm">Breakthru</a></b> from Data East and <b><a href="xevious.htm">Xevious</a></b> from Atari. US Gold is also launching Infiltrator and two Epyx titles <b><a href="worldgames.htm">World Games</a></b> and <b><a href="supercycle.htm">Super Cycle</a></b>. And don't hang up on me yet 'cos I've got more. There'll be an adventure called <b><a href="kayleth.htm">Kayleth</a></b> based on the American Isaac Asimov science fiction magazine. And last but not least we'll be marketing Vortex's new game, <b><a href="revolution.htm">Revolution</a></b>. Phew!! It was everything I expected and more. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I replaced the receiver and breathed a sigh, struggling to pull myself together -- now where did I leave my arm? It was then that I first set eyes on him ... Tall, dark and handsome. He was tall anyway. His manly torso filled the doorway. He approached me tenderly and our eyes met - well, they would've done if he hadn't been wearing a crash helmet. He whispered my name. My pulse quickened. Boom-bang-a-boom. Yes, it was the bike messenger with news of Argus's new products. I couldn't believe it. Things like this only happened in Bills and Moon. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Lothlorien label there's <b>World War I, Circus Maximus</b> and <b>Roundhead. World War I</b> is an icon-driven game about, no prizes for guessing this, World War I. Dakka, dakka, dakka. <b>Circus Maximus</b> gives you the chance to play at being Ben Hur in your own living room (I'd much rather play with Charlton Heston myself) and <b>Roundhead</b> is set in the civil war and features the fracas between the Cavaliers and Roundheads. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mind Games is launching <b><a href="grangehill.htm">Grange Hill</a></b>, knicker elastic and peashooters all round, and on the A'n'F label there'll be an all action shoot'em up called <b>Colony</b> and a kinda space age shove 'alfpenny, <b><a href="xenon.htm">Xenon</a></b>. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if that isn't satisfying enough for you, go and buy a Mars Bar. Okay, how about trying this for size -- Bug-Byte is bringing out <b><a href="miamidice.htm">Miami Dice</a></b>. Ger-oan. It's basically a load of crap... no, no the dice game. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;37,24, 5... Hut hut hut! Watch out for Mind Games' <b>American Football</b> which is being re-released on the cheapie label. After hearing all that I knew it would never be the same again. I had to tell him that we must part. "On yer bike, sunshine!" 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then it hit me... <b><a href="room10.htm">Room 10</a></b>. I remembered those carefree, heady times. Ah, he was sleek and lithe like a leopard - yes, he had spots. But what he hadn't told me was that CRL is releasing o game called <b><a href="room10.htm">Room 10</a></b>. It's a bit like a two player ping pong in 3D but it's got split screen views of either end of the court. CRL is releasing olhers too --- <b><a href="academy.htm">Academy</a>, Dr What, <a href="bugsy.htm">Bugsy</a></b> and <b>Cyborg</b>. When it's that good you never really forget. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've never been the same since - constantly slipping into daydreaming and boy, were they Electric Dreams. Which brings me very nicely to the new releases. Go all weak at the knees with <b><a href="tempest.htm">Tempest</a></b> based on the arcade game, feel good'n'dandy with <b>Dandy The Dauntless</b> and look out for <b>Explorer</b>, <b>Wardlock, <a href="starraidersii.htm">Star Raiders II</a></b> and <b>Alien II</b>. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I couldn't bear the waiting any longer - I'd call him. OI YOU!!! It was no good, he couldn't hear me -- well he did live in Manchester! I'd have to use the phone. My hand trembled. A deep, sexy, husky voice answered - it had to be a wrong number. Was my heart destined to languish in the telephone exchange of life? No, it was Gary from Ocean. Well, at least he could tell me about Ocean's new releases. <b><a href="nightmarerally.htm">Nightmare Rally</a></b> is a surreal car rally game in which the car flies through space -- weird - and by all accounts it's going to be good. There's also <b><a href="itsaknockout.htm">It's A Knockout</a></b> which is based on the TV series ... could this be Ocean's joker? If you're feeling athletic there's Imagine's <b><a href="ktennis.htm">Tennis</a></b> which features doubles - completely unique on a Spectrum Tennis simulation. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, I started. Well, I had to start sometime. Phil rushed in where Eds fear to tread -- the YS office. He clipped me to his manly breast. I clipped his ear "Guess what?" he gushed in deep pants. L've told him to buy a new pair of trousers but does he listen? "Elite's bringing out the coln-op conversion of <b><a href="spaceharrier.htm">Space Harrier</a></b> by SNK." My bliss was just about to burst. Yeuch. "And the arcade conversion of <b>Ikari Warrier</b>..." Maybe things were looking up. "...and <b><a href="scoobydoo.htm">Scooby Doo</a></b>!" My mood. Of gloom and despondency disappeared. I skipped horne with a new lightness in my step. I rushed into my bedroom -- he was sitting on the bed. I caressed his warm and furry chest and from that moment I knew - I'd never leave my Teddy at home again. 
<BR>
