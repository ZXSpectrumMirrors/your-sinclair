<p> <font size=4><b> STAR PERV</b></font><br> I bought the November 87 issue of your magazine and it is fair to say that I am very disappointed with it. There were no naked women, no whips, no stimulating stories and no readers' wives. Instead, there was just a lot of highly amusing, entertaining and informative talk about computers, computer games and other computery things - though there was a comic called <i><a href="viz.htm">Viz</a></i> which was very funny. I don't see how you can expect to compete with other titles such as <i>Knave, Men Only, Fiesta</i> and <i>Sunday Sport</i> with this approach. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest you rapidly change your content to feature more breasts, buttocks, tongues, whips and so on - the only people I can see buying your magazine are computer owners - so come on, pull your socks off (and the rest! ). <br> <b> A Star Reader (slaver, <br> pant, bonk, bonk!) <br> </b> <br><i> I'm disgusted at your attitude. You're probably one of those rubber keyboard owners with a floppy one! If you want a seedy magazine full of filth and garbage go and buy...... And for your information I don't wear socks, I wear stockings with suspenders and a garter and... oo-er whatagiveaway! <B>Ed</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> BIG EARS!</b></font><br> I was cleaning out all the black bits from between my toes with a ZX81 the other day, when I suddenly realised the answer to the ultimate question - how to become a star letter winner. It's really easy - all you have to do is follow these simple instructions... 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Complain about the price of <i>YS</i>: Groan, waffle, quid, drone, pound, blah. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Talk about a cheat in a game: In Mastertronic's <i>Jason's Gem</i>, pressing A, S and W at the same time on the menu screen gives you infinite lives. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Comment on the price of games: Ten quid!!! Think how many Mars bars you could buy for that! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Say something about machine code listings: AOF 123BOE87! 6C9507D!!! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Mention the reviews: I think (wow) that two people should review each game to give a more general impression. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. Write a sentence about sending off to software houses: Ultimate sent me a giant poster for a C*mm*d*re game. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. Ask 'Are you a goblin?': Are you a goblin? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. Pretend to live in the future: My space-ship is parked at a parking meteor. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. Think up some stupid use for <i>YS</i>: I've got a stupid one all right. I <i>read</i> it! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. Claim how poor you are: We had to sell our Jaguar XJS to buy a copy of <i>YS</i>. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. Suck up to <i>YS</i>: It's great, it's fantastic, it's amazing. (So is <i>YS</i>) 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. List a great game you've written: 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10 PRINT "HEY I'M ON TV!" 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20 PRINT "PRESS ANY KEY": PAUSE 0 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;30 GOTO 10 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;83. Claim you can't count: I can't count. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you've done all that, put it in an envelope (along with a fiver) and send to <i>YS</i>. <br> <b> Andrew "Noddy" <br> Carmichael <br> Dollar, Clackmannanshire <br> </b> <br><i> Sorry, but you don't qualify for a star letter because you forgot to mention how beautiful I am. Not only that, but you reckon we can be bought for &pound;5. That's an insult - we'd want at least &pound;20! <b>Ed</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> <i>YS</i> RULES OK!</b></font><br> Last week at school, the class had to think up a survey. We were asked to go out and ask people questions that we had thought of. My topic was computer magazines. A hundred people were asked "What do you think the best computer magazines are?" 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here are the results (Spectrum magazines only): 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Your Sinclair</i> 51% 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Crash</i> 30% 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Sinclair User</i> 19% 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this proves that <i>YS</i> is the most popular magazine of the 80s. <br> <b> Marc Rogers <br> South Benfleet, Essex <br> </b> <br><i> Thanks, Marc. The cheque's in the post. <b>Ed</b> </i> <p> <TABLE align=center BORDER BGCOLOR=white BACKGROUND=""><TR><TD> <FONT SIZE=6><B><U>STAR LETTER</U></b></font><br><font size=4><b> SPOT THE PILLOCK</b></font><br> So!

Summing up though I'd say it's six of one and half a dozen of the other when it comes to putting two and two together to make four! <b>Ed</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> OCH AYE</b></font><br> Why is it that <i><a href="montypythonsflyingcircus.htm">Monty Python's Flying Circus</a></i> gets shown in England but not in Scotland? <br> <b> An eagerly awaited piece <br> of tin foil from Vulcan <br> </b> PS People who put things in bathtubs should be denied access to railway stations. <br> <br><i> </i><a href="montypythonsflyingcircus.htm">Monty Python's Flying Circus</a><i> wouldn't be quite the same with sub-titles now would it?

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps that was the only way <i><a href="playforyourlife.htm">Play For Your Life</a></i> could get into people's homes. Run For Your Life would be more appropriate, run away as far as you can from one of the most boring, slow, unskilful, unplayable load of unrepeatable trash. What a letdown after the brilliant <i><a href="batty.htm">Batty</a></i>. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who missed the 'giveaway', thank your lucky stars. Don't waste the time or more to the point, money, in trying to buy it.

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My son is ten years old. He takes great pleasure from his monthly computer magazine, <i>Your Sinclair</i>. He does not expect to receive copies of vulgar comics with it. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought <i><a href="viz.htm">Viz</a></i> to be rude and nasty and totally unsuitable for the type of children reading your computer magazine. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think you should think more carefully about enclosing such material again or I am afraid you will lose your valued customers. <br> <b> Mrs Hilary Shaw <br> Wilmslow, Cheshire <br> </b> <p> My son, aged 12, has bought <i>Your Sinclair</i> for the past 12 months and we have been, on the whole, pleased that he should have the magazine. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the recent edition incorporated the <i><a href="viz.htm">Viz</a></i> comic which is not only highly questionable but also, on its own admission, is unsuitable for children under 16 years, without parent's consent. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I cannot rely on <i>Your Sinclair</i> to stick to computers and avoid material such as <i><a href="viz.htm">Viz</a></i> which I do not want given to my children, then the magazine cannot be bought. <br> <b> J T Lamb <br> Ashford, Kent <br> </b> <p> Having purchased <i>Your Sinclair</i> magazine for my son every month since he owned a computer I was disgusted with the <i><a href="viz.htm">Viz</a></i> comic enclosed with the latest edition. I have no wish for such filth to come into my house in this underhand manner. Surely it should be possible to buy a computer magazine without worrying about hidden offensive material. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like your assurance that this, or anything like it, will not be repeated. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am certainly considering cancelling my order at my newsagents. <br> <b> Mrs Sheila Summerville <br> Rochdale, Lancs <br> </b> <br><i> We have had a few complaints about the contents of </i><a href="viz.htm">Viz</a><i>, but it's our opinion now - as it was before it was published - that there is little, if anything in it that can't be seen every day in the national press or on prime time television. The word 'crap', for instance, is now acceptable on TV before 8pm, which is when one or two </i>YS<i> readers do occasionally watch it. Moreover, a swift journey on public transport should be enough to convince even the most sheltered parent that worse language than this is used in regular conversation by a large proportion of the population. We do not necessarily condone this - and we would never print anything that we considered offensive - but we stand by our decision to enclose the </i><a href="viz.htm">Viz</a><i> sampler. While the normal </i><a href="viz.htm">Viz</a><i> comic, as Mr Lamb says, is not usually available to anyone under 16, this supplement was specially prepared to appeal to a younger readership - ours, in fact. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did you think of it? <b>Ed</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> VIZOUT IT!</b></font><br> I am writing to complain to you about the free comic with the November ish of <i>YS</i>. I didn't get it! I bought the mag whilst on holiday in Birmingham (exotic, eh?) and there was no sign of an advert for a free comic on the cover of the mag, and I bought it without realising there was anything else to go with it. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, a couple of weeks later in Colwyn Bay I noticed a November ish of <i>YS</i> with a free comic attached. Why didn't you mention the comic on the cover of the mag? If you had done I would have asked at the till about the comic. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have bought your mag since ish one and I think it's great, and until now you have always mentioned the free gifts on the cover, so that I was able to get them at the counter. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, is there anywhere I could get hold of this comic without forking out the quid to buy <i>YS</i> again? <br> <b> Gary "Completed <i>Road <br> Runner</i>" Jones <br> Colwyn Bay, Clwyd <br> </b> <br><i> Some newsagents didn't get the </i><a href="viz.htm">Viz</a><i> supplements, through no fault of theirs (or indeed ours). So unfortunately there's no way you can get a copy unless you obtain a back issue of </i>YS<i>. Sorry about that, but they're now as scarce as an aardvark in a nunnery! <b>Ed</b> </i> <p> </font></td></tr></table><p> <font size=4><b> AFTERNOON CLOSING</b></font><br> As a regular overseas reader I've had a right gutsful of paying the top dollar for your magazine and getting as much use out of your compos as an ashtray on a motorbike. What chance have we got of competing in a compo which closed two months before we get the latest issue? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tidy up your act on this one, 'cos on your present track record you deserve a bagful of the latest stock bonds tied around your neck with a red hot Speccy heat sink... c'mon, you can do better! <br> <b> Ron Scarlin <br> Mataura, New Zealand <br> </b> <br><i> We have so many competitions an issue that it would be impossible to extend the closing date. You would have to wait even longer before you get your prize. If you took out a subscription to the mag not only would you get it earlier but it would cost you less as well. <b>Ed</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> EEE BYE GUM</b></font><br> I am writing in complaint <i>(Not another one! Ed)</i> about an article in the November issue of <i>YS</i>. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this article it says about Alton Towers, and I quote, "There may not be many reasons to venture further than Watford Gap" I find this an insult to all the northern readers and I feel an apology is necessary before I can buy your magazine again. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing wrong with the north and there are many reasons why you should venture further afield. For instance, we have all the good football teams, Alton Towers, Sellafield Nuclear Reprocessing Plant, and let's not forget <i>Coronation Street</i>! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While on the subject of <i>Coronation Street</i>, may I point out to all southern readers that we don't all talk like Curly Watts (October's Great Trainspotter) and we are not all dustmen! <br> <b> Simon Cronan <br> Poynton, Cheshire <br> </b> <br><i> True, I do know one person who lives up north who isn't a dustman - he keeps whippets instead. <b>Ed</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> TANX VERY MUCH</b></font><br> I claim to be the first person who has ever mapped <i>3D Tanx</i>, destroyed the mothership in <i><a href="tolkientrilogy.htm">The Hobbit</a></i>, not used the cheat mode in <i><a href="supremechallenge.htm">Elite</a></i>, played <i>Eye Of The Moon</i> and <i>Star Trek</i>, got infinite lives on a Lenslok and been impressed by the ZX81 's graphics. <br> <b> Michael Brocklehurst <br> Carterknowle, Sheffield <br> </b> PS If this gets to be star letter, how can you send me my fave games?

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well you are wrong.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A: The bucket? </font></td></tr></table><p> <TABLE border align=center bgcolor=white BACKGROUND=""><TR><TD><font color=black> <center><font size=6><b>DESERT ISLAND DISKS</b></font></center> <p><center><a href="../thumbs/letters/big/26b.jpg"><IMG SRC="../thumbs/letters/26b.jpg"></a></center><p> This month's castaway is in fact one of the winners of our PCW Show <i><a href="batty.htm">Batty</a></i> Challenge, Andy Lowe, who knocked up 77,130 in about 0.1 second. Here are his all-time faves... 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><i><a href="ultimatethecollectedworks.htm">Sabre Wulf</a></i>/Ultimate </b><br> In my eyes THE best, most addictive Ultimate offering. Anyway, it's still great fun just jabbing the sleeping hippos! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><i><a href="backtoskool.htm">Back To Skool</a></i>/Microsphere </b><br> Fantastically playable venture into school naughtiness. A jump ahead from <i><a href="skooldaze.htm">Skool Daze</a></i>, if only because of the snogging. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><i><a href="zynaps.htm">Zynaps</a></i>/Hewson </b><br> About the closest that the Speccy will ever get to a good, solid, arcade-style shoot 'em up. It's fast, has brilliant graphics, and it's difficult but <i>possible</i> to complete. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><i>Blind Alley</i>/Sunshine </b> Phew! Now this is going back a bit! But this, definitely the best attempt at the Tron light-cycles format, gets breathtakingly fast on later screens. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><i><a href="dynamitedan2.htm">Dynamite Dan II</a></i>/Mirrorsoft </b><br> Superbly designed platform game that takes a well-worn format to its limits. Has some great extra weapons and facilities - the Jesus walk-on-water boots being the best! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><i><a href="ystop100_2.htm">Hyper Sports</a></i>/Imagine </b><br> Jonathan Smith is an excellent programmer and I wish he'd hurry up and do something else! This kept my wrists vibrating for a week! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><i><a href="bubblebobble-69.htm">Bubble Bobble</a></i>/Firebird </b><br> Dangerously addictive, cute, varied, lots of extra features. Quite mega-ace, actually. (Can anyone beat 1,259,120 - round 72?) 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><i><a href="ystop100_4.htm">Manic Miner</a></i>/Bug-Byte </b><br> Probably my sole driving force throughout 1983. <i>(Worrabout food? Phil)</i> This game had it all - 20 screens (massive at the time), brilliant graphics, addictive gameplay, wicked humour. </font></td></tr></table> <p> <TABLE BORDER=0 ALIGN=center VALIGN=center><tr><td align=right> <TABLE BORDER=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 bgcolor="black" background=""><TR bgcolor="black" background=""><TD><font size=2 color=white><i><b>Doodlebugs</b></i></font></td></tr> <tr><td bgcolor="black" background=""><a href="http://wos.meulie.net/pub/sinclair/./magazines/YourSinclair/Issue26/Doodlebugs/YS26Doodlebugs01.jpg"><IMG SRC="../thumbs/YS26Doodlebugs01.jpg" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=173 ALT="Doodlebugs"></a> </td></tr></table> </td><td></td></tr></table> <p>
