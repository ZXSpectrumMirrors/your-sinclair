<div><b>I've just got a car from my 
brother. She's a beautiful 
twenty-one-year old orange 
Beetle called Gigi, so I can 
sing songs from the film to 
her. The only thing is, I can't actually 
drive yet so I thought that <I>Nigel 
Mansell's World Championship</I> would 
give me a push in the right direction 
before the driving lessons proper 
start. I sat down ready to take the 
wheel and find out how it's really 
done, oblivious to Andy O's 
observation that "real driving's a bit 
more difficult than sitting down in 
front of a computer." Pah! If I want to 
learn how to drive, who better to teach 
me the basics than Nigel Mansell? The 
problem was that Nigel Mansell 
doesn't really deal with basics. Ho 
hummmity hum! </b>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Nigel Mansell (the 
man) has taken part in one hundred and 
seventy-six Grand Prix, you only have to 
deal with the one. There are sixteen 
different tracks in sixteen countries so 
you've got the weather element to cope with 
too, as well as the other eleven drivers. As 
with most other driving games you've got 
options such as souping-up your car a bit 
and choosing your driver and nationality. 
Then, of course, there are all the different 
gaming options. Do you want to play the 
whole Grand Prix, or just a lap? 
Or maybe you fancy a spot of 
training with our Nige? What 
a choice! 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b><I>One of our Nigels is 
missing </I></b><br>
I was remarkably sensible and opted for the 
training session. At no point did Nigel Mansell 
appear and give me instructions. He didn't 
even pop up on screen when I drove my new 
car off the road. Call that instructive? Pah! I 
was quite disappointed, I can tell you. All I did 
was drive around the circuit on my own for 
hours getting better and better. <I>(So it was 
a help then? Jonathan)</I> Well, yes but it 
wasn't quite what I expected. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I did enjoy racing round 
the track. It's a cockpit-view racer and 
you can get a good look at your 
hands on the wheel. So, as you 
turn left you can see the wheel 
turning which helps when you 
start worrying about what 
direction you're going in. 
<I>(Linda, are you sure you want 
to learn how to drive? Andy O) </I>
The graphics are nice and simple, a bit 
like the game itself. There's nothing 
amazingly special here, the main races 
are naturally more entertaining than the 
training 
sessions 
due to the 
presence of 
(da-da-da-daaa!) other 
cars. Hurrah! 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b><I>Baby you 
can drive my car. 
Yes I'm gonna be 
a star! </I></b><br>
Before you can really start racing, 
you have to qualify. The first couple 
of times I tried to do this, I found 
myself a full two laps behind some of 
the other drivers cos I couldn't work out how to 
start. <I>(That's because you've got no idea about 
driving. In fact, you're a bit stupid when it 
comes to cars. Honestly, the way you were 
racing round - you spent most of your time on 
the grassy verges. Andy O)</I> And it wasn't cos 
I'm stupid, as Stuart Campbell had the same 
problem, so there. Actually, he didn't get 
started at all whereas I managed to qualify, 
despite my initial, erm, 'disadvantage'. (The 
trick is to press forward and fire together 
before accelerating.) 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you're really keen on winning then you 
might want to take a peek at the control 
section. Here's where you can soup up 
your car by fiddling with the tyres and 
the aerofoils. Such fiddlings can 
prove very useful if you've got to 
deal with inclement or unusual 
weather. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each circuit comes 
complete with a weather 
report along the lines of 
'overcome the effects of thin 
air. The reduction of air 
pressure means less drag... the 
oxygen means that the engines produce less 
power.' If you're up on your racing cars no 
doubt you'll read such a description and 
immediately think, "Ooh, I'd better take a look 
at those tyres. Hmmm. And the aerofoil could 
be tilted slightly more..." Unfortunately, such 
subtle points are a bit lost on me. But no 
matter, I can still see that they're a good thing! 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b><I>Slipping and sliding </I></b><br>
And now we come to the part of the 
programme where you get told about the not-so-good things. We were 
given <I>Nigel Mansell's World 
Championship</I> on disk and  
it took a helluva lot of
turning over and waiting in 
between the game bits. 
Jonathan and I shuddered 
<I>(Shuddered, we did. 
Jonathan)</I> when we thought 
of the tape version. If this is 
what you have to do with the 
disk, just imagine the loading 
times and tape-turnings. Agh! 
<I><a href="streetfighterii.htm">Street Fighter 2</a></I> revisited. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite being called <I>Nigel 
Mansell's World Championship</I>, 
this game has absolutely nothing 
whatsoever to do with the 
moustachioed one. Oh yeah, his 
name appears now and then but 
never his face. Or even his 
moustache. I mean, it's not as if we're 
asking Gremlin to do the impossible. I 
would have been satisfied with just 
Nigel's grinning visage on the loading 
screen. After all, Bob Monkhouse 
appeared in digitised form in <I><a href="bobsfullhouse.htm">Bob's Full 
House</a></I>, as did Bob Holness in 
<I><a href="blockbusters.htm">Blockbusters</a></I>. Hang on, maybe it only 
works with people called Bob. </I>(No, 
Huxley Pig did it too, and Max 
Headroom. Jonathan)</I> They're not 
exactly people though, are they? No, 
Nige has definitely fallen foul of the 
Curse of the Not-Bobs. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorry about that little 
tirade, but I was
kinda banking on 
Nigel making an 
appearance so it 
was all very 
disappointing 
indeed. But I shouldn't be too harsh cos overall 
the game is actually very good. 
Well, it is if sitting glued to a screen 
for hours following a track is your 
idea of fun. Me? I could do it for 
ages - even if I don't get to meet 
Nige at the end! Y'know, I could 
really wow the driving instructor 
when I go for my first lesson. What I 
really need to do is a bit of real 
driving... Ahh, I know! Oi, Andy! You 
know your bike? Well, how about 
letting me have a little go on it, just 
to get used to the roads, like? <I>(Not 
blummin' likely, I've 
watched you on that 
computer. You're
dangerous and I'm 
not letting you 
anywhere near my beloved crap bike. Andy O)</I>
