have thought, feared (or even 
hoped) <I>Teenage Mutant Hero 
Turtles</I> is actually jolly good. There, I've 
said it. (The rest should be easy.) </b>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's very, very (very) colourful for a start (but 
you've no doubt spotted that from the 
screenshots), very well put together, and if the 
simple gameplay seems more reminiscent of a 
console game than a classic Speccy product, well, 
that's probably ideal for the younger Spec-chum 
they're aiming at here. Put any prejudices you 
might have aside - if you ignore the <I>Turtles</I>, you're 
actually ignoring a rather snazzy piece of Speccy 
programming. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, so you've bought the game and loaded it 
up. What's the first thing to strike you? Well, it's 
the graphics, isn't it? They really are very (very) 
pretty indeed. The turtles themselves are green 
and yellow and look exactly how you think they 
should (unlike many licenced characters depicted 
on the Speccy who end up looking like, well, 
anyone). They can't do that many fighting moves, 
it has to be said - there's no crouch or duck for 
instance - but what they can do (attack with 
whatever that turtle's particular weapon is, jump 
by curling up into a spinning shell) works 
very well indeed. Even when they're 
climbing up ladders - normally a graphical 
disaster in most games - it all looks okay,     l 
possibly because 
they're such 
cartoony characters 
and so easy to 
animate. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact the whole thing 
looks very much like a 
cartoon - the baddies aren't 
the ninja assassins of the upcoming film or 
original comics, but big, bright and colourful 
monsters like in the TV show. The first level 
features giant jumping eyeballs, mutant flies, 
some sort of fiery yellow characters who look like 
they're made out of lava and a purple Tasmanian 
Devil-shaped end-of-level 
chappie who's an absolute bast 
to kill. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, they're all very 
reminiscent of the colourful 
mutants from <I>Dan Dare Iil</I> - no 
surprise when you realise the 
Speccy <I>Turtles</I> has actually been done by the 
same programmers. These are the guys (Dave 
'Code' Perry and Nick 'Graphics' Bruty, both of 
whom freelance for Probe) who've been 
responsible for a goodly number of the really 
bright and colour-packed Speccy games of recent 
years, including <I><a href="savage.htm">Savage</a></I>, <I><a href="tintinmoon.htm">Tintin On The Moon</a></I> and 
their more personal project, <I><a href="extreme.htm">Extreme</a></I> (which is 
reviewed this ish). From these results I'd say they 
were an ideal choice for the <I>Turtles</I> - you can't 
imagine the 'heroes in a half shell' (whatever that's 
meant to mean) looking any better on the Speccy. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As is perhaps fitting with such cartoony 
characters, gameplay is on the same simple (but 
very well thought-out) sort of level as cutsie 
arcade games like <I>Super Mario Brothers</I>. This 
really does come across as the sort of thing you 
might play on a Nintendo or Sega console - lots of 
platforms, lots of baddies, lots of collectable extra 
energy doobries (in this case bits of pizza) and 
even backgrounds built up largely of massive 
bricks. Perhaps it's got a bit more of a beat-'em-up 
emphasis than many similar games, but then that's 
only fitting considering the fact that the turtles are 
meant to be (whisper it) ninjas and everything. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what do you have 
to do? Well, our
heroes must take 
part in a series 
of missions, 
most of which 
consist of
some 
running around on a big overhead-view street map 
(on which each Turtle is the tiniest green speck) 
before popping down one of many available sewer 
entrances. Suddenly you find yourself in a split-level platform-and-ladders environment (the 
cleanest, driest and - it must be said - reddest
sewer I've ever seen in my life). 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you were no doubt 
hoping, this is packed with 
baddies to duff up, and 
it isn't likely to be particularly 
long - reach the end and 
one of two things happens. 
Either a) you reach a ladder 
to the outside world 
(indicating that you've been down the wrong 
entrance and should search around for the 
right one) or b) you come across your objective. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first mission, for instance, your 
job is to try and rescue your girlie reporter 
friend April O'Neil from the minions of 
the evil Shredder. It won't take that 
long to come across her (she's 
down the sewer entrance nearest 
the end of the dock) but oh no! Just 
as you find her this purple devil 
thing attacks (and he's much harder to beat than 
most of Shredder's, erm, 'men'). Beat him (if you 
can) and by the time you get back to where April 
was it's too late - the rest of Shredder's hench-things have come along and whisked her away! 
(Time to move onto the second mission, methinks.) 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so it goes on. Later levels not 
only see you having to do a lot 
more searching around on the 
surface (where you've got to 
avoid tiny hazards 
like men and 
tiddly trucks) 
before you 
can find the 
right 
platform-and-ladders bit to 
enter, they also 
feature longer and 
more complicated 
platform bits. One mission 
(set in a warehouse) sees 
you running around on a series 
of conveyor belts, while another 
has you actually swimming through a network of 
underwater tunnels, trying to defuse bombs which 
are set to blow up the Hudson River (or 
something)! This is slightly less successful than 
the platform levels (mainly because the turtle 
sprite looks rather ridiculous in 
swimming mode) but it's quite well 
done nonetheless. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What else is there to be said? Well 
- though it's not really got all that 
much to do with the game - it's rather 
strange that considering how cuddly 
and friendly they've made all the turtles, they've 
left them with all their various bits of martial arts 
weaponry. The Image Works packaging cleverly 
'forgets' to show Raphael's Sai (a sort of big knife 
with hand guards) or Michaelangelo's Nunchukus 
(those things with two bits of wood joined with a 
chain) - the two most obviously ninja-like weapons 
- though it's perfectly happy to depict the more 
normal sword and stick. (Presumably these are 
less likely to put mums off buying the game.) All 
four oriental weapons still appear quite distinctly in 
the gameplay however - and worse too. Take the 
shurikens (those throwing star thingies) which you 
can collect - they're rather brutal for a cartoon 
game, aren't they? 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, enough of that. What else is there to 
say? Well, I've not yet pointed out (or not 
properly anyway) that extra energy can of 
course be got from pieces of pizza 
left lying around the sewers (yuck!) 
while ropes (for climbing from 
building to building), missiles, 
temporary invulnerability and other 
collectables are to be found dotted 
around the place. Each time a turtle 
dies he actually 'gets captured' and 
you get to pick another one to 
continue the mission - 
it's not impossible that you may come across the 
captured one and rescue him a bit later however. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You want more? Well, how about the bit 
where you're invited to 'party down in the 
party wagon', which apparently 
involves firing missiles from a 
modified VW Microbus at the 
Foot Clan (Shredder's lot)? 
Sounds good, though 
unfortunately I haven't got to 
that bit yet. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what's the verdict? Well, 
for me <I>Turtles</I> has been a very 
pleasant surprise. Rumours had 
been circulating around the industry for ages 
that the game was really bad - apparently the 
American Nintendo and Amiga versions are 
absolutely terrible or something, and this 
game is based on them - but no, Probe 
have modified it rather a lot, and the 
finished Speccy thing only bears them a 
slight resemblance. In fact, it's really rather 
nifty. Don't expect the most in-depth game 
of all time - but for what it is, it's more or 
less perfect. I think it's excellent fun. 
Hurrah! (There you go - an entire Turtles 
review, and not one mention of the dreaded 
word "Cowabunga!") Oops!
