<div>Larry Horsfiled's 
<i>Starship Quest</i> is the 
follow-up to his very 
popular <i><a href="magneticmoon.htm">Magnetic 
Moon</a></i>, and, before I forget, if 
you want to buy both games 
together you can do it at the 
reduced price of &pound;4.50. 
<i><a href="magneticmoon.htm">Magnetic Moon</a></i> was a very 
enjoyable multi-part space
game, inspired by Larry's
love of science fiction, and 
this is an even better sequel, 
again influenced by several 
sci-fi novels but in 
particular a story called 
<i>Galactic Derelict</i>, by Andre
Norton. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again there are both 
48K and 128K versions of 
this three-parter, and it's 
good to see someone making 
full use of the extra memory 
of the bigger machine rather 
than producing the bog-standard 48K game and 
leaving it at that. The 128K 
version has more features, 
much more gameplay and a 
greatly-extended ending 
(something I know loads of 
people wished every 
adventure had), and that's 
the one I looked at. 
Remember though that 
some of those features will 
be missing on the smaller 
memory machines. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <i>PAWS</i>-produced game 
begins with an optional 
story and instructions 
program. This is well worth 
reading - in fact, it's half a 
novel in itself, but I wish the 
author would disable the 
key with the exclamation 
mark on it!!! I don't mind 
them now and then, but it 
gets a bit wearing when 
they're in every other 
sentence!! See what I 
mean?! He should also learn 
the difference between 'it's' 
and 'its', which he confuses 
constantly. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the story, well, 
basically it's that you're 
Mike Erlin, you're on a 
spaceship and you wish you 
weren't. You've got two 
minutes to gather some 
equipment together, make it 
to the lifeboat and jump ship 
before the mother ship does 
its hyperspace number. 
Then you can get back to the 
planet you just left and find 
out the secret of the two 
discs that were given to you 
in <i><a href="magneticmoon.htm">Magnetic Moon</a></i> by a 
beautiful princess. These 
aren't any old discs, not your 
Dolly Parton 45 
and <i>Jason 
Donovan Live At 
The Adelaide 
Abattoir</i> - these 
two discs could 
hold the key to 
the universe! 
Blimey. But don't 
tell me... in the 
next part you 
have to find the 
lock. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back in this bit, 
and specifically 
the first-part (<i>The 
Abandoned 
Planet</i>), you begin 
in the Stellar 
Queen's control 
room with Cap'n 
Morgan and Mr 
Pocks for 
company. I'm glad 
to see the author's 
included a few 
more response messages this 
time, so that you're not 
forever being told that "You 
can't do that" every time you 
try to examine the billion 
and one things in the 
location description. Okay, 
so often you get a "That's 
just scenery" message, but 
at least it makes a change. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I made a quick trip around 
the ship and found 
Commander Giles being 
treated in bed by my 
girlfriend! What? Oh well, it 
is the sick bay and she is the 
ship's doctor. I'm glad I 
found her though, because 
when I said I was leaving 
she gave me something I 
really wanted. You'll have to 
play the game to find out 
what it is. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of other 
characters in the game 
works well, and adds a lot to 
the atmosphere. While there 
is any atmosphere, that is, 
as pretty soon you should be 
down on the surface of an 
alien planet, although it 
looks remarkably like old 
England to me - gently 
rolling countryside, long 
grass, dotted with trees. 
There's a sign on a derelict 
fence, but unfortunately it's 
written in alien and I must 
have left my <i>Teach Yourself 
Alien</i> book back on the ship. 
That's a shame, as you 
pretty soon find quite a few 
other signs too. And what do 
those markings on the two 
discs say as well? 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some 
abandoned buildings about, 
and you get quite a good 
picture of this seemingly 
deserted planet. There are 
some creatures around, 
apart from the droids you 
find later on. There are a 
few worms to be dug up, and 
a pair of eyes down a hole in 
the ground. I'm going to give 
away the answer to one of 
the problems here, as it 
shows why, to me, FSF 
Adventures are still in the 
second division of adventure 
producers and not the first - 
although they're admittedly 
near the top of the league! 
To get the creature whose 
eyes you can see, you have 
to THROW WORM IN 
HOLE (and do it twice). If 
you try the more obvious 
PUT WORM IN HOLE 
you're told you can't do it, 
and this could make many 
people, especially new 
players, think they were on 
the wrong track and so not 
persist. If you try to DROP 
WORM DOWN HOLE you 
merely DROP WORM, 
which burrows away into 
the ground and disappears - 
and there is only a limited 
supply of the wormy things. 
Other little errors like "a 
area" and "a animal's 
burrow" just slightly spoil 
what's otherwise a jolly 
good romp. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You certainly can't fault 
the features the game has. It 
accepts full sentences, and 
you can LOOK NORTH as 
well as GO NORTH. You can 
also LOOK UNDER, 
ACROSS, AROUND, OVER 
and IN things (and will need 
to). INFO gives a list of 
which commands have been 
abbreviated to one letter, 
and VOCAB gives a lengthy 
list of acceptable commands. 
There are RAMSAVE and 
ALL commands, and with 
the EXAMINE ALL 
command you can specify 
whether it's the objects 
WORN, CARRIED or 
HERE. Phew! 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day 
adventures, like books, 
films, music or anything 
else, are all down to 
personal taste. Some people 
rave over Larry Horsfield's 
games, saying they're the 
best things since Heinz 
Steamed Puddings, but, 
while I quite like them, they 
don't have that extra bit of 
sparkle for me that you get 
from John Wilson or Linda 
Wright. Don't let that stop 
you trying one of them 
though, as they may well 
sparkle for you.
