<p> <font size=4><b> MOVE OVER HERCULE POIROT</b></font><br> I'm desperately trying to find the good old Imagine's <i><a href="movie.htm">Movie</a></i>. Every month I look through your brillo mag to find at least one place I could get it, but to no avail. So I've decided to write. Any ideas? And could you please make (if you're still the boss) <i>(She isn't. I am. Ed)</i> David McCrappa... or whoever the new guy is... put clearer instructions on his programs. Thanks. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the way, I think your mag is very good looking and bright, but then again so are you, and I'm very depressed to hear that you're leaving the Ed's bench. <i>(Get it right, sunshine. She already has. Ed)</i> Sob sob. Yeeeeaaargh!!!! Gotta cheer up. Well, that's all for now. Byeee! <br> <b> Heikki Kahkola <br> Nokia, Finland. <br> </b> <br><i> Sherlock Holmes obviously hasn't any worries about you nicking his 'work' Imagine's </i><a href="movie.htm">Movie</a><i> came free with our January ish. You clot! Order the back issue and you'll get it. Oh, and I'll give you a playing tip in advance - after you've found Tanya, try and find 'the chocolate' <b>Ed</b>. </i> <p> <font size=4><b> TASMANIAN DEVIL</b></font><br> In the February issue of your rad mag, which has only just arrived in Australia <i>(Serves you right for living at the crap end of the planet. Get a subscription. Ed)</i>, I saw Richard Scaglione's letter complaining about not being able to get games in New Zealand. Well, it's the same here in Australia. There aren't many people who own Spectrums here, so they took the games off the market - and I agree totally with Richard when he said it was unfair. You wouldn't believe how much Richard and I have in common. <br> <b> Tim Kershaw <br> Summehill, Tasmania <br> </b> <br><i> Have you seen </i><a href="ystop100_3.htm">Jet Set Willy</a><i> yet? It's brilliant. Only joking, cobber. What's happening in </i><a href="neighbours.htm">Neighbours</a><i> over there? Daphne's about to be killed off over here, which'll be a bit of a blow to poor old Des. Still, he's got Mike to help him look after the baby, so it's not that bad. <b>Ed</b>. </i> <p> <font size=4><b> POKES POKES POKES</b></font><br> In the April edition of your organ <i>(Oo-er. Ed)</i> you published a reply to Robert Brook's question which purported to 'explain' how to insert POKEs. I read this answer, dug out the Spectrum manual and tried to load the POKEs provided on the April cassette. The result? Zilch!! Give us a break. How about an idiot's, guide to using Basic for loading POKEs? A lot of us are still labouring under the misconception that the Sinclair is no more than a rather expensive games-playing toy. If you would like to do your customers a real service and turn large numbers of them on to the wonders of programming, then you could do worse than get them started with POKEs, and explain what's happening as you go. Oh, and am I thick, or is the Spectrum manual about as much use as an Ordinance Survey map of the Falklands in Hampton Court maze? <br> <b> John Ramsay <br> Hampton Court Maze <br> </b> <br><i> Try this one: POKE 23609, 30. It'll make your keys beep instead of click when you type stuff in. Extremely useful. Yes, we might do an idiot's guide to Basic in a future issue, so 'keep 'em peeled'. Oh, and as regards the manual, it depends which one you're talking about - the one that came with the earlier Speccys (Sinclair rather than Amstrad) was brilliant. And about two squillion pages thick. In fact I've got one here - but you can't have it. Ha ha ha. You'll have to make do with a badge. <b>Ed</b>. </i> <p> <TABLE align=center BORDER BGCOLOR="#208020" BACKGROUND=""><TR><TD><center><font size=6><b>THE WONDERFUL WORLD OF SPECCY</b></font></center><p> <font size=4><b> HAD IT THREE MOTHS</b></font><br> I am interesting in computers, I have got Amiga 500 since three moths. I saw some interesting information about your magazine in computer magazine !BAJTEK! I have few books of computer, but as they German in writing, I have not the understand it very deep. I would like to know more about my Amiga and programs for her. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please send me more information, what about is your magazine, and where can I for subscription rates. <br> <b> Przemystaw Stark <br> Gorzow, Poland <br> </b> <br><i> I think between you and !BAJTEK! you've got more crossed wires than the entire British Telecom network. Go buy a Speccy. <b>Ed</b>. </i> <p> </td></tr></table><p> <TABLE align=center BORDER BGCOLOR=white BACKGROUND=""><TR><TD> <FONT SIZE=6><B><U>STAR LETTER</U></b></font><br><font size=4><b> THE PEASANTS ARE REVOLTING</b></font><br> I have one minor complaint about your magazine. For the past three months I have seen the latest issue of <i>YS</i> out on the shelves days before I have had it delivered to my door. The problem is that I subscribe to <i>YS</i> and expect to receive it before all the peasants who don't. Just imagine, if you let this continue the plebs would let it go to their heads and soon we would have a revolution on our hands. Now you wouldn't want this to happen, would you? So, in future, send the mag off to the fantastically rich subscribers and let the lower life scum wait a few more days. I know you won't let me down, as the future of democracy in this country hangs in the balance. <br> <b> David 'Let Them Eat Cake' <br> White <br> Ramsbottom, Bury <br> </b> <br><i> But don't forget, the 'peasants' don't get the free full price Ocean game or the spanky </i>Subs Club<i> newsletter (now written by Davey, our resident crooner). Oh, and it's your fault you get your sub a couple of days late - fancy living in a place called Ramsbottom. The staff who mail the subs out always have a 'birrova laff' and address your particular one to 'David White, Ewesbuttocks, Bury'. This slows the postie down a bit, as you will have noticed. <b>Ed</b>. </i> <p> </td></tr></table><p> <font size=4><b> AVID VIEWER</b></font><br> Just thought I'd drop a line to the best Speccy mag this side of Uranus. Long have I been an avid 'viewer' (since ish seven, aktcheloi). I have to admit to having read <i>Cra...</i> (oops, sorry, nearly swore there) before, but <i>YS</i> is far superior. It's a lot less bovver than a hovver and is accepted in far more places than certain charge cards I could mention. <i>YS</i> is superbly superb and amazingly amazing. It's got far more in it than other mags (death to the bear), it's laid out better and the reviews are splendiferous. In fact <i>YS</i> is Godlike. Anyway, enough of this flattery and to the point. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good luck, new Ed. Long may you grace the hallowed pages of <i>YS</i>. Don't get me wrong - T'zer will be missed... maybe (only joking). Will we ever see her shining choppers again? Will we ever see her sadistic comments at the foot of letters again? The world awaits. So, Matt 'Goss' Bielby, you'd better do a good job. (It's a shame about 'Ken', isn't it?) Well, that's it. Bye! <br> <b> Iain 'Two I's' Work <br> Ayrshire, Scotland <br> </b> <br><i> Poor old Ken, it is a shame I agree. Still, he earned a bit of dosh and got to appear on </i>Top Of The Pops<i>, which pleased his old mum. He ran his course though, and Luke and I feel we owe him nothing (oo-er), nothing at all. We owe him nothing - nothing - nothing - nothing at all (oo-er). Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing at all!! I'm a man, not a boy (oo-er), nothing nothing nothing (oo-er). <b>Ed</b>. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shut up. <b>T'zer</b>. </i> <p> <font size=4><b> SEXIST CRAWLER</b></font><br> Nice to see a man controlling <i>YS</i> again, Matt. Now that T'zer has gone the mag can have a few changes. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, the new ratings system introduced by the ex-Ed is, in a nutshell, crap. Okay, so it was T'zer's last wish as Editor, but did <i>YS</i> have to have the system? Why not change the rating titles to Graphics, Sound, Playability, Addictiveness and VFM? Prove your ability as Ed and alter them now (but keep the percentage though). 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, <i></i>YS<i> Back Issues</i>. When back issues sell out, why don't you reprint them when the demand comes? When you do get round to reprinting them, print the October and November (1986) issues first so I can complete my collection, and then start buying binders. Make <i>Your Spectrum</i> back issues available as well. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, a few minor changes to the features of <i>YS</i>. Increase the amount of pages in <i>Program Pitstop</i> (nice to see that John-Boy has taken up the post) and make <i>Tipshop</i> bigger too. <i>Letters</i> could do with more space as well. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking of letters, why not give every letter published a &pound;5 software token, and the Star Letter a &pound;30 software token? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death to T'zer and long live Matt 'Goss' Bielby. Etc. Etc. <br> <b> Nick Humphries <br> Saffron Walden, Essex <br> </b> <br><i> I like you. I like your no-nonsense tone. You have obvious foresight and are indeed wise. I agree whole-heartedly with the 'long live Matt Bielby' (not sure about the 'Goss' bit, though). I... er, hang on, T'zer's tapping me on the back of the head. Oh, she wants a word with you. <b>Ed</b>. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How dare you! Such blatant sexism. And what horrendous crawling! It might cost you your badge - but just to show you I'm fair I'll do one of my 'even chance' gambles. I have here a smallish (and rather rusty) chunk of solid cast iron, which I'm going to drop into Matt's coffee. If it floats you get a badge, if it doesn't - you don't. Here goes. PLONK. My oh my, it's plummeted to the bottom - bad luck. <b>T'zer</b>. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Erm, can you get me another coffee please? <b>Ed</b>. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. Get it yourself. <b>T'zer</b>. </i> <p> <font size=4><b> INSULTING BEHAVIOUR</b></font><br> I don't know who made you Ed, fart-face, but I would like to ram a Commodore down his throat. I would like to state that I don't have a Commodore, I have a spanky Sperry. Also, you are a disgusting barf-baggy puke of a person. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yours magically (cos I'm Scottish), <br> <b> Graham Clark <br> South Queens Ferry, <br> Lothian <br> </b> <br><i> How dare you! If you think I'm going to print a downright insulting letter like that then you've got another think coming, 'Jock'!!! Umm, oh dear, something's gone wrong. Well, you can't have a badge, anyway!! <b>Ed</b>. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh yes you can. <b>T'zer</b>. </i> <p> <TABLE align=center BORDER BGCOLOR=cyan BACKGROUND=""><TR><TD> <table align=left><tr><td align=center><IMG src="../thumbs/letters/trainspotter.jpg"><br><font size=5><B>TRAINSPOTTER<br>AWARD</b></font></td></tr></table><font size=4><b> HE HAVE NOTICE!!</b></font><br> I claim a Trainspotter award. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You might haven't notice, but in <i>Pete's Puzzlers</i> (May ish), you say that we must send in our completed puzzles before the 31st of April. Well, in Portugal the magazine arrives a little bit late, but I think you made a mistake, and I'm still sending in my coupon. <br> <b> Manuel Sousa <br> Oeiras, Portugal <br> </b> <br><i> Nope, no Trainspotter - and I'll tell you why. From now on any letters purporting to have uncovered a 'gaff' are going to have to be pretty 'watertight' themselves. Let's have a look at your opening sentence, which is 'you might haven't notice'. Hmmmm. You got the apostrophe in the right place (well done), but the overall sense is a bit crap - ie 'you might have not notice'. It should have been 'you might not have noticed' (observe also that there's a 'd' on the end of notice). And the fact that you're Portuguese is no excuse as far as I'm concerned, so you can stop bleating. <b>Ed</b>. </i> <p> <font size=4><b> SYNTAX ERROR</b></font><br> When I looked in your mag I saw something strange - there is nothing wrong with the review <i>(Which review? Which ish? Ed)</i> but with the pictures of the different levels. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level One - The Ninja is almost at the end of the game/level and has played for just 22 seconds. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level Two - The score is lower than the one on Level One, and look at the time. One minute 25. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level Three - Time is 46 secs (back to the future). Etc. Etc. Etc. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can this happen? If there is a routine for this I'd like to have it. Besides, all the multiface POKEs of the <i><a href="lastninjaii.htm">Last Ninja 2</a></i> doesn't work. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keep the badge. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I love your mag! Bye! <br> <b> Michiel de Boever <br> Haarlem, Holland <br> </b> <br><i> Bad luck, matey. Due to dodgy syntax, you don't qualify either.

Ed)</i> snapped off! So I advise anyone with a +2 to treat it like you would your granny's best china! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Your Smash Tapes are brill. How do you do it? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) In ish 42 on the <i>Contents</i> page you said that <i>Future Shocks</i> were on page six. Bodge!!! Page 95, m'dearie. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4) I'll have a Trainspotter and a badge now please. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5) Onto the free badge with issue 41. Who the hell's Bernadette? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6) I don't suppose I can have the Star Letter award can I? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7) Please print this letter as I've sent three before and never had one printed. <br> <b> Stuart Richards <br> Whitchurch, Shropshire <br> </b> <br><i> 1) I actually throw my granny's best china out of the window of her 12th storey flat every time I visit her, so that's pretty flimsy advice so far as I'm concerned.

After flicking through some of my issues of <i>YS</i> I read the story of Rob Moorman, then found out more a couple of issues later - from Rob's so called 'friend', Simon Westaway (alias Lorenzio The Unlucky Woodchuck). Then Rob wrote again telling you not to print any more of his life story. But this just isn't good enough. We want the rest of the gossip. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please Simon (alias Lorenzio The Unlucky Woodchuck), if you are out of hospital yet, please write to <i>YS</i> with all the latest titillating titbits and scandal. <br> <b> Mark Rawe <br> Grays, Essex <br> </b> <br><i> Yes, come on Lorenzio The Unlucky Woodchuck - send in some more 'dirt' It's about time, I agree, that the saga unfolded further.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just load this AMAZINGLY BRILLIANT and STAGGERINGLY EASY game into any Spectrum and watch as, before your eyes, it creates games at the rate of one per minute - games that are UNMATCHED by ANY OTHER.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ASTOUNDINGLY SIMPLE YET TRULY INNOVATIVE games program costs just &pound;2.99 (soon to be &pound;3.99) at almost every sales outlet you can name.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately editions now on sale have a slight bug which causes every game to have the word SIMULATOR in the title.

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Help! I'm stuck up a tree. I'll tell you quickly what happened. I was with some friends, tree climbing, when one of them spotted this gigantic elm. "We'd better not risk going up that one," he said. "Some of the branches are a bit rotten - and it must be 200 feet high." Not being one to be outdone by a 'wood-plant', I said my goodbyes as my chums went home for tea and then started my lone assault. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Things went well. It took about an hour, but I reached the top. Trouble is that I'm now in such a weird position that I can't look down and therefore can't find my footing for the descent. I've scribbled this (with the trusty Bic ballpoint I always carry) on a piece of bark and I'm going to drop it to the ground. I hope someone finds it and sends it to you as you're the only person who might be able to help. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please hurry, the branch I'm holding just made a creaking noise! <br><b>Jonathan Ivy <br> Halifax </b><br><i> Dear Jonathan 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are in a fix, aren't you dear? I'm trying to think back to my 'tree-climbing' days to see if there are any hints or tips which will serve to illuminate you on how to extricate yourself from your present predicament. Lumme, the old memory isn't what it used to be you know. Um. Oh, I know. Break off the nearest longish branch (about six feet should do) and swish it about beneath you. Eventually it will make contact with some protruberance or other, which you should mentally 'map'. Discard your stick and then leap for where you think this protruberance is. If you're lucky you'll either land on it or it will snag on your jumper (you are wearing a jumper I hope, Jonathan, it is an essential piece of tree-climbing 'kit' after all). This will be the first leg of your journey to terra firma over - just repeat the process 30 or 40 times and you'll have made it. Good luck. </i> </font></td></tr></table> <p> <TABLE BORDER=0 ALIGN=center VALIGN=center><tr><td align=right> <TABLE BORDER=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 bgcolor="black" background=""><TR bgcolor="black" background=""><TD><font size=2 color=white><i><b>Doodlebugs</b></i></font></td></tr> <tr><td bgcolor="black" background=""><a href="http://wos.meulie.net/pub/sinclair/./magazines/YourSinclair/Issue44/Doodlebugs/YS44Doodlebugs01.jpg"><IMG SRC="../thumbs/YS44Doodlebugs01.jpg" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=107 ALT="Doodlebugs"></a> </td></tr></table> </td><td><TABLE BORDER=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 bgcolor="black" background=""><TR bgcolor="black" background=""><TD><font size=2 color=white><i><b>Next Month</b></i></font></td></tr> <tr><td bgcolor="black" background=""><a href="http://wos.meulie.net/pub/sinclair/./magazines/YourSinclair/Issue44/YS44NextMonth.jpg"><IMG SRC="../thumbs/YS44NextMonth.jpg" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=141 ALT="Next Month"></a> </td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <p>
