<div><b>Hello, ladies and 
gentlemen, and welcome 
to <i>Blind Date</i>. Behind the 
screen are three loovly, 
loovly sport sims, I 
couldn't choose between them but 
somebody's going to 'ave to. 'Is 
name's Percy and 'e's from 
Huddersfield. Come in, our Perce. 
Ooh, that's a loovely bit of hur you've 
got thur. Now Percy used tur play fur 
Arsenal, is that right Perce? "Yes, 
Cilla. I did." Okay, Perce. 'Ave you got 
yur first question? </b>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have, Cilla. Hello, ladies. I am a bit 
of a sporty chappy and there's nothing 
I like better than playing a few sports 
sims on my Speccy. If you were a 
compilation of sports sims, what would you be 
called? Number, erm, Three? "Hi, Percy! Well 
actually, I am a compilation and I'm also a real 
sport. What's more, I've been told I'm a bit of a 
challenge." "Super!" "Yes, I am a bit! So how 
about <i>Supersports Challenge</i>?" "Right, 
Number Three please Cilla." (Some time later 
and Percy has taken <i>Supersports Challenge</i> 
out for the day and tried to get to know it 
better. Cilla asks him how it went.) 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b><i><a href="wrestlingsuperstars.htm">Wrestling Superstars</a></i></b><br>
Now Percy, you started off with this one - how 
did it go? "Well, Cilla, it was okay but nothing 
special." Ooh, Perce! That doesn't sound very 
romantic. What went wrong? "Oh, it wasn't that 
there was anything terribly wrong with it, but 
there was none of that special chemistry that 
makes you want to carry on seeing 
someone. Oh, and there's no two-player option either." So tell me, 
what did you do togethur, Perce? 
"Well, we had a few bouts together 
and I did do some pretty spiffy stuff. 
But basically, all it involved was me 
wrestling against the 
computer. I got in a few punches and a bit of 
kicking, but mostly it was just the usual 
joystick-waggling which can get very tiring. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few nice touches like the way 
you bounce back off the ropes when you run in 
to them. Unfortunately, I hurt myself a bit at 
that point because I bounced into mid-air and 
fell over. I also managed to climb up on to the 
ropes and jump on to my opponent. That was 
fun." Well, it sounds like you had a little bit of 
fun. Are you going to see one another again? 
"Oh, I won't throw <i><a href="wrestlingsuperstars.htm">Wrestling Superstars</a></i> away, 
or anything like that. I'm sure I'll get it out 
of the box now and again. I just 
don't think it'll be a long-lasting 
relationship." And the score... 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>60%</b>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b><i><a href="internationalspeedway.htm">International Speedway</a></i></b><br>
Now, this one's a bit older, Perce. Did it show? 
"It did a bit, Cilla. Now I've nothing against 
older games and if you like a bit of speedway 
then there's nothing astoundingly wrong with 
this. We have actually met before but after 
you've become reacquainted and had a couple 
of goes round the track, there really is nothing 
else to do." 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely you could have found 
something to do together? "Well, I 
did try but, believe me, after a 
couple of spins round the track I 
didn't fancy many more. I 
actually came first, y'know? Don't 
get me wrong, Cilla, I've seen 
worse! I did get into <i><a href="internationalspeedway.htm">International 
Speedway</a></i> for a while, but again I 
don't think this is a relationship 
that's got much longevity in it." But 
what about looks, did they make 
yur hurt beat a little bit faster? "No, 
it really did look its age. 
It also looked a bit 
cheap actually." And 
the score... 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>57%</b>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b><i><a href="firstdivisionmanager.htm">First Division Manager</a></i></b><br>
This is another one that you've met 
before, isn't it, Perce? Tell me, did 
you two old friends 'ave a lorra,
lorra laffs? "Not really, Cilla. Y'see, 
I'm very fond of sports sims and all, but football 
management games leave me a bit cold. It's all 
those boxes and numbers, they really don't 
excite me. I'd much rather just watch the footy 
on the telly. That said, this is a 
very competent management 
sim. It's easy to follow and 
you're in no doubt about what 
you're doing at any point cos 
every action is all nicely labelled in its own little 
box. In fact, it was so clear that I managed to 
win my first match of the season." 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you got off to a good start, eh? 'Ow did it 
go from thur, love? "I must admit, Cilla, that I'm 
a bit fed up with all these management sims 
looking so darn similar. The first time you pick 
one up and find it's got a nice office set-up with 
a direct phonelink to your physiotherapist and 
banker, it's great. But now all footie 
management sims are the same." You want a 
bit of variety, do you luv? "I'm not putting <i><a href="firstdivisionmanager.htm">First 
Division Manager</a></i> down at all, Cilla. I mean, it's 
got all the features you'd expect and a lot of 
people like those features. It's those people 
that this game's aimed at, I shouldn't think it'd 
make any new converts." So will you be 
playing an away game, eh Perce? 
Will you be having another go, like? 
"Oh, maybe if the mood takes me." 
What's the score for this one? 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>70%</b>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b><i>Cue Boy</i></b><br>
You two hadn't met before, 'ad you? 
"No Cilla, and I must admit that I think 
I've found the very computerised 
sports game for me." Ooh, luv, tell us all 
about it. "Well I was well-disposed towards this 
one from the start cos I've always been fond of 
computer snooker and pool, partly cos it was 
the first sports game I ever played on a 
computer. I've actually had quite a lot of 
practise so I was raring to go with this one. 
From the very beginning, it looked good. You 
can play a friend or one of the computerised 
opponents, and they really do look like a 
tough bunch." A bit of rough, eh Perce? 
"Something like that, Cilla. As well as getting 
a kind of random choice of opponent (you 
have to press a button and play whatever 
chap the cursor thang stops at - it's a bit like 
trying to get the last L on a SKILL level thing 
on a Triv machine!) you can also choose 
between snooker and pool." 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell us, Perce, what one did you go for? "I
had a go on both, but I settled for snooker. I 
always seemed to have the same opponent 
though. Mad Harry, he was called and he 
looked a bit like Rolf Harris, only more thick-set. He was blimmin' good though. Whenever 
it was his turn, a little caricature would jump up 
on to the baize, if there was no way he could 
pot a ball, his mouth turned down. But if it 
looked like he had a chance, he'd go and 
stand by the pocket that he intended to lob a 
ball into. As he stood there, with a great smug 
grin spread across his face, I really wanted to 
give him a good poke with my cue." Ooh, 
Perce, we couldn't 'ave that. Not on a family 
show! "I know, Cilla, I was only having a little 
joke. Anyway, what was I saying... Oh, yes, 
how <i>Cue Boy</i> and I got on. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As I mentioned before, the computer is very 
good indeed. It knows all the posh angles 
and how to put the perfect spin on a ball. I 
felt a bit stupid, but I'm proud to say that I 
kept calm and I'd actually won a fair few 
frames by the end of the day! Mind you, a 
couple of those were cos my opponent 
potted the black. It was the best game 
I'd played all day, a really lovely little 
sim." So you'll be seeing one another 
again I hope? "Well, I've already taken 
<i>Cue Boy</i> home a couple of times and 
we've got on just as well. I think this could be 
the start of something beautiful!" Oh, 
isn't that just loovly. And tell us what 
we're all dying to know - what's the 
score? 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>90%</b>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b><i>Slicks</i></b><br>
Now then Perce, time to spill the beans on 
<i>Slicks</i>. Was it as racy as you thought? "Oh, 
Cilla! Cheeky as the day is long, you are." <i>(Oh 
no. I can't stand it any more. What's on the 
other channel? Jonathan)</i> Click! 
"Now then! A big hand for the 
game Debbie's bringing out from 
the audience. It's called <i>Slicks</i>, 
ladies and gentlemen, isn't that 
grand? Say 'yes, Paul'. Now then! 
So you're an overhead-view 
scrolling race game, are you? Well, 
let's put you in the magic Speccy 
and see what happens. By golly, 
you are a swift little mover, aren't 
you? That scrolling certainly shifts, 
shifts it most certainly does. Now, 
what are you doing? Oh, you're 
qualifying for the race. And now 
you're challenging another driver in 
order to move up the league table. 
What a clever little tinker you are! 
Care to pick a card while you're at it? Hmmm. 
Now I'm the one who tells the jokes around 
here - you're not supposed to be funny by 
becoming rather repetitive once the initial 
appeal's worn off. And you're certainly not 
supposed to disappoint the nice ladies and 
gentlemen by failing to have a simultaneous 
two-player mode. Say 'no, Paul'. And it's no 
use looking at me like that - I don't care if you 
can ram the other cars off the road, it still 
doesn't excuse the ease with which you can 
crash. So there it is, ladies and gentlemen, 
<i>Slicks</i>. You'll like it - not a lot, but you'll 
like it. (I'm working him with me foot, 
you know. Ha ha! Say 'yes, Paul'.) 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>74%</b>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><i>(Hang on, I hate Paul 
Daniels. Turn over!
Andy O)</i>... our Perce and 
<i>Supersports Challenge</i> didn't exaccly 'ave a 
dream date. Still, they did 'ave a bit of a laff 
and that's what it's all about. No chance of 
wedding bells ringing here, unless you count 
that <i>Cue Boy</i>. What do you say, Perce? "It was 
worth it for the highlights, Cilla." 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there you have it, ladies and gentlemen. 
It's a little bit disappointing for me, cos I do 
loov an 'appy ending.
