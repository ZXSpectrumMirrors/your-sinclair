<p> <font size=4><b> SENT UP</b></font><br> While playing Firebird's mega-mega-mega-etc game, <i><a href="sentinel.htm">The Sentinel</a></i>, myself and a friend, Rob Dickson, decided to print out the title screen. Imagine our surprise when the message 'SEEKING RELOAD BLOCK 42' printed out. Its ink colour would have been black, so it wouldn't have been seen on-screen. Does this mean that some more levels will be made available for sale on an extra tape by Firebird? <br> <b> Adam Sotheran <br> Romiley, Cheshire <br> </b> PS We are currently on level 7253, code 21887706. <br> <br><i> After talking to those likely lads at Firebird I learnt... absolutely naff-all. All Firebird will say is that it is possible that there'll be some extra levels for </i><a href="sentinel.htm">The Sentinel</a><i> but it certainly won't be this year and possibly not next. Hang on a mo, maybe it was talking about that highly illogical game, </i>Star Trek<i>. <b>Ed</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> VIVA L'ESPANA</b></font><br> It's my duty with Francisco Alexandre to tell you the truth. <i>The Peeker</i>, a graphic utility that was published in the last issue of your mag, was first published in a Spanish magazine - <i>Microhobby</i>, no. 78 -- and is by Francisco Alexandre. Khalid Jamil is telling porkies. Enclosed are three photocopies of the original listings of the program which was, and still is "El Espia". 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorry about my English, but I think it's better than your Portuguese. <br> <b> Paulo J Lucas Martins <br> Viseu, Portugal <br> </b> <br><i> Hasta la vista! Ole, ole! Buanos Noches! Uno servesio! So What's wrong with my Portuguese? Well, strong words Paulo (even if they were in Portuguese). I think it's over to Khalid to defend himself and come up with an exclamation, sorry explanation! <b>Ed</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> FOLEY FOLLY</b></font><br> My 128 +2 is knackered! l am scrawling this to give your followers a piece of advice - don't buy Amstrad/Sinclair! They must be the worst computers around (well, except the Commode +4). I've had EIGHT, and they all screwed up within a month. What's more, I lost (sniff, sob) an original of <i><a href="warmartech.htm">WAR</a></i>. Good job it wasn't a decent game! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However I must praise the staff at the Cwmbran branch of Currys. I know they've had a lot of bad PR <i>(They have? Ed)</i>, but they always replaced my machines, no problem. Eventually I asked for a refund, and was simply handed &pound;159.95. I'm now saving for an Atari ST. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it's not all doom and gloom. I still own a rubber-key 48K, and I can honestly say that it's a damn sight better than any 128 +2! <br> <b> Axel Foley <br> Cwmbran, Gwent <br> </b> <br><i> Are you accident prone perhaps? I've never heard of anybody else whol had as much bad luck as you with their computers. It's possible that your Speccy+ 2 objects to being used as a skateboard when you're not playing games on it. Try using a plank of wood instead. <b>Ed</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> ZILCH INPUT</b></font><br> How's about making the message length in <i>Input Output</i> a line (or six words) longer? Oh, and on the subject, I have sent no less than six ads in, and had no more than 0 (zilcho) printed. Sorry, but if you want my praise, you'll just have to do better. <br> <b> Colin Campbell <br> Kilwinning, Ayrshire <br> </b> <br><i> If we increased the message length in </i>Input Output<i> by an extra line you'll have even less chance of getting one printed. We receive thousands of entries a month and there just isn't enough space to print them all. I think you've been pretty lucky getting none printed out of six. It could've been out of 200! But seriously we do try to print as many as we can - the best way to increase your chances is to write clearly and legibly in the allocated space and send separately to the </i>Input Output<i> section. Good luck! <b>Ed</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> TORRYD AFFAIR</b></font><br> As I was teaching my half-Peruvian, lesser-spotted, three-footed budgie Pythagoras' theorem for the fourth time, I realised that you never, ever, print totally sane letters in your fabulous and really trendy mag. This is the third time I have written to you all at Castle Rathbone and my budgie and I both think it's about time you printed me. If you don't I'll have to take drastic action and sell up my stock of computer software, hardware, add-ons and join a monastery. I hear that the clothes they give you to be a monk are quite trendy. Anyway, back to the serious stuff. <br> <b> Mike Ledingham, aged <br> 1 1/2 <br> Tarry, Aberdeen <br> </b> <br><i> I wouldn't like to see you get into any bad 'habits' so I've relented and printed your letter. Here's a joke to cheer you up. What did the Friar use to open the door? A monkey! Ha ha, thought you'd find that a bitorralaff! <b>Ed</b> PS Is your stock of computer software cheep budgiet stuff by any chance? </i> <p> <font size=4><b> SPOT THE MISTAKE</b></font><br> Erm, is Brian there? His cream for the boil on his bottom is ready, if you'd like to pick it up. Oh sorry! Wrong address! <br> <b> Andrew Geoghegan <br> Bradford, W Yorks <br> </b> <br><i> As it happens Phil could do with a zit stick after all those cream cakes he keeps stuffing himself with! <b>Ed</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> MANGO MANIA</b></font><br> I am the leader of the Polish Mango Society. My colleagues are The Man, Slaphead 1, Slaphead 2 and Fartin' Martin. We all love Sigue Sigue Sputnik, Run DMC and the Beastie Boys. Hello to Lloyd and Smiley as well as Poofter Hesford, Boghead Jeffries and Kind Dude Squires. We also have another society. It is the Guru Appreciation Society. We worship Guru Nanak and Guru Gobind Singh (all trendy lads). I think that Ultimate is crap and 3D games are boring (with the exception of <i><a href="headoverheels.htm">Head Over Heels</a></i>, which Slaphead 2 owns). <br> <b> Mr ZX81 Powerpack <br> Stratford-on-Avon, <br> Warks <br> </b> <br><i> I'm particularly fond of mangoes myself. Oh, and I love bananas and fresh pineapple makes me drool too. And kiwi fruits are simply delectable, not at all like Kiwi men, though it has to be said (It does? <b>Marcus</b>) that lecherys are the best of all! <b>Ed</b> Don't you mean lychees? <b>Marcus</b> PS Don't ever write such a load of old trash again. <b>Ed</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> KEEP ON THRUCKEN</b></font><br> May I offer my congratulations on your new <i>Program Pitstop</i> routines. As a new computer user I found them very interesting, and was well pleased with the end results. I have recently purchased a Spectrum 128 +2, after the children's 48K was accidently wrecked (note date of birth - 18.8.42 - mine, that is, not the 48K). The sound routine by Tim Follin was a joy to hear. All members of the household look forward to your excellent publication every month - keep up the good work, and may we have more of the same. <br> <b> M A Depear <br> Thrucken Holt, Lincs <br> </b> <br><i> You can indeed have more of the same thing 'cos every month we'll be packing </i>Program Pitstop<i> with even more handy hints from a bevy of top name programmers and loads of readers' racy routines. So stick with </i>YS<i> and keep your eyes glued... <b>Ed</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> MILLER SHITE</b></font><br> A very quick line indeed to tell you to sack T'zer and bring back <i>Program Power</i> and Kevin Cox. Have you noticed that <i>YS</i> is remarkably similar to <i>Smash Hits</i>? <i>Frontlines</i> is similar to <i>Bitz</i>, posters in the middle, letters, <i>Hack Free Zone</i> is similar to <i>Get Smart</i>, <i>T'zers</i> is like <i>Mutterings</i> (well it used to be). Where does this influence come from? Does T'zer read <i>Smash Hits</i>? And why is T'zer called T'zer? <br> <b> Steven Miller <br> Great Yarmouth, Norfolk <br> </b> <br><i> Are you mentally deranged? What on earth do you want to bring Kevin Cox back for - he's already done enough damage. As for the similarity of </i>YS<i> and </i>Smash Hits<i>, I don't think they're at all alike. When have we ever had a pin up of Mel Gibson or Madonna? And the answer to your last question - why are you called Steve? I suspect it had something to do, with your parents! <b>Ed</b> <p><center><a href="../thumbs/letters/big/23a.jpg"><IMG SRC="../thumbs/letters/23a.jpg"></a></center><p> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> WORRA HUNK</b></font><br> We are the two avid readers of <i>YS</i> and we were pleased to see the four tasty chunks in the September issue. We were wondering if we could have a signed photograph of Peter George and some information about him. We like the rough and rugged look! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hope you can oblige. <br> <b> Helen and Elaine <br> Brixton SW9 <br> </b> <br><i> Peter is 5'2", 16 stone has one blue eye and one brown and mousey hair. He loves the Bee Gees, hates physical exercise and spends a lot of time wearing cap sleeve T-shirts and strutting! As you can see he#s also very photogenic... <b>Ed</b> You summed me up beautifully - I'm as rough and rugged as they come. If you want a good time you can't go far wrong with me. <b>Pete</b> He's also a pathological liar! <b>Ed</b> <p><center><a href="../thumbs/letters/big/23b.jpg"><IMG SRC="../thumbs/letters/23b.jpg"></a></center><p> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> GRAND PRIX BOOB</b></font><br> With regards to September's edition of <i>YS</i>, on page 10 in <i>Future Shocks</i> is a screenshot for a game called <i><a href="grandprixsimulator.htm">Grand Prix Simulator</a></i>. I don't know about you but I think you must be a load of Grand Prix not to notice the screenshot's upside down. I hereby make a claim for a Trainspotter Award. <br> <b> Tone Villacci <br> Bevendean, Brighton <br> </b> <br><i> If you stand on your head and read the review you'll find that the screenshot isn't upside down so I'm afraid you don't qualify for a Trainspotter, Award so ner! <b>Ed</b> </i> <TABLE align=center BORDER BGCOLOR=cyan BACKGROUND=""><TR><TD> <table align=left><tr><td align=center><IMG src="../thumbs/letters/trainspotter.jpg"><br><font size=5><B>TRAINSPOTTER<br>AWARD</b></font></td></tr></table>Re: Multiface 128 Special Offer.

"...You don't mean the one on page 10, do you James?" "Of course I do, you senile old moron." "Well in that case I think they ought to give Simon Barnard a Trainspotter Award!" <br> <b> Simon Barnard <br> Herne Bay, Kent <br> </b> <br><i> Well spotted! The screenshot was indeed upside down and a Trainspotter Award is on it's way. This slight cock-up was all due to Peter, the Art Ed who thinks he's an Aussie. You should see his bilabongs! <b>Ed</b> </i> <p> </td></tr></table><p> <font size=4><b> HAMSTERUNG</b></font><br> I was reading issue 20 and I found a mistake in <i>Hit List</i>. It said that we have lost <i>Curse Of Sherwood</i> but there it is at number 9. I think Marcus got mixed up with the prices in the review of <i><a href="wolfan.htm">Wolfan</a></i>. He said it was &pound;2.99 but it's really &pound;1.99. If I don't get an award I'll eat my hamster. <br> <b> Stuart Oliver <br> Lawrieston, Falkirk <br> </b> <br><i> As much as I can't stand cruelty to animals I have to say that you're right. Marcus is a complete wally and did indeed make a terrible error in the </i><a href="wolfan.htm">Wolfan</a><i> review.

I have no choice, I'll be playing on my good old ZX Speccy, not a +3, not a Sega or Nintendo games console. You want to know why? <i>(No. Ed)</i> Because I've got no dosh to buy any of these out-of-this-world, super-duper things. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yours feeling-sorry-for-myself <br> <b> Nell Watson <br> Maryport, Cumbria <br> </b> <br><i> There's no reason to feel down in the dumps 'cos there's nothing wrong with the 48K Speccy. I'd personally rather play with that than any of the consoles - you get such a thrill after all that knob twiddling (0o-er) when a game finally loads. <b>Ed</b> </i> <p> <font size=4><b> YUM YUM YUM!</b></font><br> Hallo! I saw your picture in August's <i>YS</i>, and... er... hmmm... aaahh... er... (a few years later) er.. hmm.. will... er... will you... ahh... will you marry me? Oh! I'm already imagining our marriage, you with a pretty red dress, and I with a yellow suit. <br> <b> Sandra 'Coach' Silva <br> Setubal, Portugal <br> </b> PS I'm 94 years old. <br> <br><i> Sounds like you're colour blind to me!

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember that lovely little program in the Star Letter in your August edition? Well it drove my Speccy bonkers!! Firstly it tried to convince me that it was a member of the KGB and was after a particular Commodore computer. Then it started hissing, and it wouldn't stop wriggling on the desk. And then, if that wasn't enough, it got me in a half nelson on my bedroom floor. I expect full compensation by making this your Star Letter - or else... <br> <b> Sean Rowan <br> Castlebar, Co Mayo <br> </b> PS Cheeky little liar, aren't I? <br> <br><i> Leesen carefully 'cos I shall zay zis only wunce.

Allowing them to suffer such inhumane torture. You can't possibly do such a dirty deed and send Phil back here. I haven't actually got a +3 to hand but I could send you three of your fave games if you promise not to send him back.
