Wow. Basically!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to various work commitments, the site had to be put mainly on the back-burner, but it still had
it's ground-breaking features. Macromedia Flash movies were the big thing, so I started playing about with it. First came
the (basic) 30 second intro in March, and that was followed by a 4 minute mini-movie in November. Also a couple of simple
Java applets made their appearance, and in July the site had a complete makeover from a fairly simple design to the
rather fancier appearance you get today. Add to that a few new features, and the site's not done too badly as a result of
my free time being somewhat shortened.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Popularity-wise, the site's completely exceeded all expectations, almost <i>tripling</i> over the
past twelve months, plus gaining two website awards. With Christmas and New Year out of the way, the site now gets roughly 
400 visitors a day (from about 1,400 hits). There are quite a few things planned for the site this year, but we'll see
what happens time-wise, but 2000 looks like being a better year than 1999.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's all going to be rather good!

<font size=5><i>THINGS TO NOTE:</i></font> <p>
All stats generated from web logs sent to me from ClaraNET. If ClaraNET doesn't send me the stats due to a server failure,
or if I lose the stats (like when I lost about two week's worth in August 1998 (boring story)), then the stats are lower 
than they should have been. This is where the "Corrected" stats come in: these reports take the average stats for the days
which <i>do</i> have stats and scales it up to a 31 day month. This allows me to see the growth (or otherwise) in interest
in the site. An example would be trying to compare January and February stats - since February only has 28/9 days, its raw
stats are probably going to be lower than January's, even though the site's been more popular.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stats which have been lost appear in the bar charts as either a ridiculously low number, or
as "-----" in the quantity field.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clear? No? E-mail me at ysrnry@the-den.clara.net for a better explaination! *g*<p>
