The early days of the Rock'n'Roll Years, when the site covered just the first 72 issues
of YS, had no articles, a handful of screenshots and a smattering of graphics around
the site. The incompleteness of the access logs is due to ClaraNET's first faltering 
steps in providing them.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The YS Rock'n'Roll Years started out as a series of weekly 
Usenet posts providing summaries of Your Sinclair magazines - a kind of "In This Month
In History" - which would complement the comp.sys.sinclair FAQ as a guide to which
Spectrum games were hot and which were turkies. People started asking for the whole lot in one
go, rather than six issues a month, so I started the website on 16th August 1997. Not 
a lot of people knew about it, though, and add the fact that there was actually very 
little on the site it only attracted a few visitors. About 20 a day in fact, generating
90 page impressions.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well. Everyone has to start somewhere...

<font size=5><i>THINGS TO NOTE:</i></font> <p>
All stats generated from web logs sent to me from ClaraNET. If ClaraNET doesn't send me the stats due to a server failure,
or if I lose the stats (like when I lost about two week's worth in August 1998 (boring story)), then the stats are lower 
than they should have been. This is where the "Corrected" stats come in: these reports take the average stats for the days
which <i>do</i> have stats and scales it up to a 31 day month. This allows me to see the growth (or otherwise) in interest
in the site. An example would be trying to compare January and February stats - since February only has 28/9 days, its raw
stats are probably going to be lower than January's, even though the site's been more popular.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stats which have been lost appear in the bar charts as either a ridiculously low number, or
as "-----" in the quantity field.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clear? No? E-mail me at ysrnry@the-den.clara.net for a better explaination! *g*<p>
