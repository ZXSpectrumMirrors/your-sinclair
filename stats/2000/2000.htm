For a site whose webmaster is rushed off his feet most of the time, this one has done fairly well this year.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This site became a true archive, with all the pages generated from a central relational database, and this allowed for things like Company Softographies and the cross-referencing to happen. More articles were added during the year, not as many as I'd like, mind, but it's good that the site is still growing. Two significant developments were the scans archive (things like "Next Month", "Wally Monthly", etc), and the arcade screenshot slideshow added to each coin-op conversion article - ground-breaking features for a site such as this one. A few more Java applets were added, including the now-infamous <a href="http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/hurdieho.htm">Hurdie Ho!</a> There's a Java game in the works, my first YS-related one (my first Java game, <a href=http://www.the-den.clara.net/wipeout/>WipeOut!</a> was a puzzler, and a good indication of the quality to expect in YS HyperCapers) - expect that "soon".<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The move to a different webserver at the end of July meant a severe drop in visitors until the site was respidered again by all the major search engines, hence the rather large dip in the stats at that time. <a href=http://www.ys3.co.uk/>YS3</a> was made an associated site - it follows on nicely from Your Sinclair's reign, and this website now stores all the back issues to it (but they're not included in the site stats).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that's about it! The number of visitors for 2000 is up 50% on 1999, and the number of hits has almost doubled this year, and with something like 1,800 pages on this site today, with plenty more planned, we haven't even reached the halfway point towards what I want to achieve here.<br>
