A boom year. The site became more well known, but, as it was it wasn't anything special.
It needed something more. People were crying out for original YS articles. At first I was
more than a bit concerned about the copyright situation - if I scanned hundreds of articles,
would Future Publishing clobber me?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I contacted Future, and they seemed pretty uninterested in the
whole thing, so, at the same time that I started adding articles, I started my quest to
find the original writers so I could secure their permission.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The response to the articles was amazing. The amount of people
visiting exploded from the 20 a day at the start of the year to 141, with 422 page hits
a day.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The site also had more and more graphics added to provide a
better look and feel, Paul Jenkinson started his journey through every single issue of
YS providing screen shots for every game mentioned, Gerard Sweeney and others provided
cover scans, and the content of the site was expanded to the whole of the 93 issue run of YS.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With nearly 500 original articles on the site at the end of the year, plus
many permissions from the original authors to back them up, the YS Rock'n'Roll Years had 
established itself as a major website in the Spectrum emulation scene.

<font size=5><i>THINGS TO NOTE:</i></font> <p>
All stats generated from web logs sent to me from ClaraNET. If ClaraNET doesn't send me the stats due to a server failure,
or if I lose the stats (like when I lost about two week's worth in August 1998 (boring story)), then the stats are lower 
than they should have been. This is where the "Corrected" stats come in: these reports take the average stats for the days
which <i>do</i> have stats and scales it up to a 31 day month. This allows me to see the growth (or otherwise) in interest
in the site. An example would be trying to compare January and February stats - since February only has 28/9 days, its raw
stats are probably going to be lower than January's, even though the site's been more popular.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stats which have been lost appear in the bar charts as either a ridiculously low number, or
as "-----" in the quantity field.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clear? No? E-mail me at ysrnry@the-den.clara.net for a better explaination! *g*<p>
