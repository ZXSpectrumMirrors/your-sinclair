technology to repair it. He's now the only person in the country with a
Fairy Liquid bottle permanently poking from his sleeve - 65 per cent
human, 30 per cent bionic and 5 per cent sticky tape. Simon Bates hater
(aren't we all?). Learnt how to bullfight by practicing with rabbits, 
guinea-pigs, domestic fowl and donkeys. Then ditched bull fighting for
hot air ballooning until he nearly killed himself and trying out
warplane flying. Fell down the stairs once and got amnesia. "Who am I?"
he foolishly asked the YS team. "You're Olga Korbett, the famous
defecting Bulgarian gymnast and you're on the run from a KGB snatch
squad," they replied. Marcus then legged it out of the door, pausing
only to perform a half triple-back pike arabesque en route.</td>

Sumo wrestling. Was given an original pet - Farty the Warthog. Tried to
pass him off as a bull to Marcus, but was foiled. "That's not a bull...
it's Farty on stilts." Farty died... his last words were "BANG!" and
that was it. Now haunted by Farty's ghost.</td>

<p><center><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#FF0000"><b>The Test</b></font></center><p>

Before anyone could become a YS reviewer, they had to take a secret test. Although everyone had to swear an oath not to reveal it,
and also were hypnotised so that they'd forget it, various pieces of information came out.
The YS reviewers' secret test they had to take involved a banana, an
aardvark, a bicycle chain, a pogo stick, playing R-Type, spoon
balancing and moths sellotaped to their forehead.<p>
That probably explained why they were all so well balanced whilst writing for the mag.<p>

<p><center><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#FF0000"><b>Who Drew These?</b></font></center><p>

All charicatures were done by YS's prolific cartoonist Nick Davies, apart from the following:<br>
