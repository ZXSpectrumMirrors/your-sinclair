        <b>04/12/05:</b> It's done! Again, the soundtrack was something I had to listen to a few times before I was completely happy with it, but overall I'm pretty happy with it. A year in the making... blimey...<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, I'm now just sorting out the hosting side of things, and I also want to revamp the downloads page tomorrow night. So... <i>maybe</i> it'll be available Monday night sometime.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
        <b>01/12/05:</b> I'm determined to get the 1985 chapter out this month. So, I've tweaked a couple of the video segments, tomorrow I'm going to tweak a few other things, then I'll mix in a soundtrack over this weekend.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So... next week, then.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
		<b>30/10/05:</b> Well, it's the end of October, so why isn't it out?<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of Real Life things got in the way - they seem to becoming more frequent these days... sigh... - but I've made a major decision. I've scrapped the original 3D intro animation that I've been planning.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That perked me up immensely. It's still going to be inspired by Elite, but the one I'm now developing isn't so fiddly and doesn't require so much manual tweaking. In fact in a very short amount of time I've managed to finalise the movements of all the objects. I now need to perfect the camera angles, twiddle about with a couple of objects themselves, add lazers and that should be it.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the actual content, there were a few comments by my previewers, so I'm going to have to re-jig a couple of sections, and I've also put in an additional section which should come as a nice surprise, and certainly one that I enjoyed doing highly.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the new release date? I'd like to say November, but the Real Life Stuff is stepping up a few gears, so might not be until December, which would be nice as the release of the 1985 chapter would come out not just 20 years after 1985, but also 20 years after the release of the first issue of Your Sinclair.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which is nice.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
		<b>10/09/05:</b> This weekend I'm actually putting together the draft version of the chapter - here's the first full frame:<p>
		<center><IMG SRC="1985_2.png"></center><br>
		Once that's put together, that's it for the main content besides the odd bit of minor twiddling. This means I'll be able to return to the intro animation (the one that uses the new 3D graphics engine), finish that off and finally mix the soundtrack. I reckon this could be out in October...
<p>
<hr>
<p>
		<b>23/08/05:</b> It's getting there :)<p>
		<center><IMG SRC="1985_1.png"></center><br>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
		<b>22/08/05:</b> The first full draft of the text for 1985 has been written, which usually means that the first draft of the content of the chapter isn't that far behind. After pretty much eight months of writer's block (as seen by me spending time avoiding it by working on the 3D animation package) I think I've started to nail it. It looks good on paper, which is always a good sign!
<p>
<hr>
<p>
		<b>19/08/05:</b> Tip for the day for all you budding animators out there: <i>never</I> do an animation that involves a lot of hand-crafting. This first full-size (well, 20-odd seconds) 3D animation which I'm going to use for the 1985 intro is, well, pretty hand-crafted, and as a result takes bloody ages to accompolish very little. After this one I'll stick to more-or-less 100% computer-programmed animations - far, <i>farrr</i> simpler, and also a lot more fun. Well, I'm the sort of person who likes emulating the <i>3D Ant Attack</i> engine in Perl, so your own mileage may vary...<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Anyway...</i><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here's a working screenshot of the very early version of the animation I'm working on. It'll form the basis of the final intro:<p>
			<center><img src="dogfight_1.png"></center><p>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to when the 1985 chapter is going to come out... all I'll commit to is "any decade now"...
<p>
<hr>
<p>
		<b>23/07/05:</b> Heh, I <i>knew</I> I shouldn't have set a deadline for myself :) Spent most of my recent time off work sleeping and cycling... However, I'm now back on the ball and have finished the animation package. There's a small change I want to do regarding motion blur, but I'll do that once I have the 1985 intro animation ready for its final rendering.<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the end of July is out, but <i>now</i> we're moving...
<p>
<hr>
<p>
		<b>23/06/05:</b> One of the benefits of being too hot to eat and sleep is that you get to do lots of coding on lots of raw energy. The 3D animation package is almost done - or rather the bits that I actually plan to use. Tonight I sorted out the parameterisation, and I have algorithms in my head for natural tilting and also chase cameras. Should be completed over this coming weekend.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>So</i>... soon after that I'll do the 1985 intro animation, and then the chapter itself. Seeing as I have a whole lot of free time right now, with more coming my way soon, this <i>could</i> be out by the end of July...<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Stay tuned...</i>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
		<b>20/06/05:</b> Fannnnn-tastic!<p>
		<center><IMG SRC="ring2a.png"></center><p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OK, so far I can place and move the camera at any point, pointing it at any point, place and move an object at any point, and have that object point towards its path so that it looks like it's travelling along it. Can also add and move light-sources too. A <a href="http://obdwww.egyptus.co.uk/ring2a.mpg">demo</a> is available for download - a short 21sec 3.6Mb MPEG file.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And next... proper parameterisation of rotates, stretches, etc. A proper chase-camera option. Automatic tilting into curves. Generic parameterisation.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's all so do-able, it's scary...
<p>
<hr>
<p>
		<b>16/06/05:</b> The 3D animation package is turning out quite nicely, although development time has been a little sluggish due to Real Life Stuff. I'm still working on the first task: specifying light sources and camera positions. Currently have code to place and move lights and cameras anywhere, move them along a line, that sort of thing. The hardest part was finding out how to move in a circle in three dimensions, but <a href="circles.png">I've cracked that</a> and am now about to implement splines (moving in curved paths in various ways).<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A demo is in the works, and I'll put that out once I've put in all the camera functionality I want, but here's a very simple frame from it:<p>
		<center><IMG SRC="3d_demo.png"></center><p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rendering time is OK, although the final renderings with full scenerey, action, reflections, lighting, etc will probably be painful...
<p>
<hr>
<p>
		<b>30/05/05:</b> Still playing around with POVRAY, but I've written a little script that would trace a bitmap and then write a POVRAY file that describes a prism defined by that bitmap. It's quite effective:<p>
		<center><a href="group_large.png"><IMG ALT="Metallic YS Logos" SRC="group.png"></a><br>
			<font size=2>Click on image for 1024x768 PNG file (1Meg)</font><p></center>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is seriously cool, and I haven't even started the animation part!
<p>
<hr>
<p>
		<b>22/05/05:</b> Well... just as I started writing my own 3D renderer, I discovered it didn't do anything automatically for you - shadows, reflections, etc. So, I searched the web for 3D renderers that could take a text file describing a scene and then render it.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found <a href="http://www.povray.org">POV-RAY</a> - a freeware raytracer that's been going for ten years, and available on many platforms. Lookie:<p>
		<center><IMG SRC="litedemo.png" ALT="Lighting Demo"></center><p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was described using a dozen or so lines of text. Lumme. I'm going to <i>love</i> writing a wrapper around this little beauty!
<p>
<hr>
<p>
		<B>15/05/05:</b> Whoa... Real Life Stuff definitely got in the way. Remember when I said there were quite a few variables in my life back in December? Well, since then I've moved house and changed jobs. The dust is now settling, and I'm now getting my mind back around what I want to do with 1985. The draft script has been redrafted, but I haven't even <i>looked</i> at it for a few months, so will refresh my memory by reading through it once more. And there's the little task of writing a 3D animation package...<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>But...</i> I have more free time and energy now, so things might move a lot quicker than before, so expect a few over-enthusiastic entries about how the 3D renderer is coming along "soon" ;)
