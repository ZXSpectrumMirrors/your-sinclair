	<b>31/12/06:</b> Happy New Year everyone! You'll be glad to hear that work on the 1988 chapter has started and the first draft of the script has been written. It's going to be a jam-packed chapter which I'm hoping to squeeze into eight minutes, so it will be one of the longer chapters of the series. The reason for this is that I consider 1988 to be the peak in Spectrum gaming, so there's a lot to cover.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've also planned what animations I'd like to do within the chapter, and for some reason the one I'm working on at the moment really is making me drool. Here's a static shot - click on it to get a larger rendering:<p><center><a href="1988_scenery_big.png"><IMG SRC="1988_scenery.jpg"></a></center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope to start on getting it animated later on today, but thought you might like to see that. There'll be at least two chapters released in 2007, and maybe up to two more, but Real Life Stuff is bound to get in the way as I'm due to move house again again (again). We'll see...
<p>
<hr>
<p>
	<b>21/12/06:</b> The 1987 chapter is now ready for download! HTTP, BitTorrent and GoogleVideo are all available.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
	<b>20/12/06:</b> The soundtrack has been mixed, and it was a fiddly one as well as there are two bits of soundtracks that must be synchronised with the footage. It works OK - mixed results, really - but it's good enough to release. I'm now sorting out distribution stuff - expect a release announcement tomorrow evening, hopefully.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
	<b>17/12/06:</b> The intro is now complete, and the main footage is now being updated and rendered, which should finish in the next couple of hours. The next thing to do is add the soundtrack whilst reordering bits of the footage to fit (it's another one of those chapters which have sounds that must be played at specific points along the way), and that should be it.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm definitely aiming for a release in the next few days. Stay tuned...
<p>
<hr>
<p>
	<b>13/12/06:</b> Time passes... all graphics for the intro done. The scenery was finished a while back, and the moving parts within that scenery have just been completed and will be slotted in tonight, ready for a final render. That just leaves some last-minute edits to the chapter content together with mixing the soundtrack.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christmas release?
<p>
<hr>
<p>
	<b>30/10/06:</b> Happiness is... getting access to a computer which renders around ten times faster than your own machine. That two-month estimated rendering time I mentioned now looks a lot smaller: six days or so. And that's on one machine.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't get your hopes up <i>but</i> a release before Christmas could be on the cards so we can celebrate 1987 just when we're starting on 2007...
<p>
<hr>
<p>
	<b>18/10/06:</b> The intro is looking <i>really</i> good. Here's a frame:<p><center><IMG SRC="1987i3.png"></center><p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One downside: it's going to take an absolute age to render the final version. Current estimate is <b>two months</b> of CPU time! <i>Fortunately</i> I have more than one machine at my disposal, and the next version of Povray will support machines with multiple processor cores, so things will speed up a bit when I finally form that render-farm involving my rendering box at home, and a few machines at work.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It'll be well worth the effort though, and whilst the intro for 1987 is being rendered, I'll start work on 1988 so that there's no real dead time.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
	<b>14/09/06:</b> Work on the intro has started - the intro I planned really was a bit ambitious, especially as it was meant to be over in 20-30 seconds. So, I've slimmed it down and it's going to feature only one game. I have place-holder graphics for most of the elements in the scene already, but here's a teaser from before I put them in:<p><center><IMG SRC="1987i2.png"></center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you should see it populated and in motion...
<p>
<hr>
<p>
	<b>10/07/06:</b> The draft version has been compiled and is currently being reviewed.<p>
<center><IMG SRC="1987_01.png"></center><p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the intro it will be around 7.5 minutes long, which is more or less average length for these chapters. There are a couple of experimental bits, too, so it'll be interesting to see how well those go down with the punters. I couldn't find an appropriate use for the 3D renderer this time around, so it's going to be restricted to the spankily-imagined intro that I currently want to do. I <i>was</i> going to do an intro based on Driller, but as Driller just shows off the Freescape graphics engine, and as generic 3D graphics looks very similar to it, I've decided to get my influences from some other games.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's games <i>plural</i>.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This could be my most ambitious intro yet. We'll see.
<p>

<p>
	<b>02/07/06:</b> This week I'll be generating a draft version of the 1987 chapter. All individual pieces of footage have been created and edited, they just need putting together into a whole. Nothing is final, though. Far from it, in fact - there are plenty of good games that will not get a look in, and so there'll be some switching out and around before I'm happy with it. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Things have also been delayed as Frodo's power supply (this is the animation rendering machine) burned up and filled the computer room with smoke whilst triggering the flip-switch in the fusebox. End result: one dead motherboard. A new one is in place now, so Frodo is now a 0.75GB RAM 2.8GHz Celeron D machine running the 64-bit version of Xubuntu 6.06. As my rendering scripts are very disk-intensive, the speed up is only 25%, but it'll do.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
        <b>24/05/06:</b> In-depth research on 1987 has started. This basically means flicking through scans of YS, SU, Crash, C+VG and The Games Machine making notes of what games caught peoples eyes, what major news happened, interesting adverts to use, that sort of thing. Should have that bit done by the end of the week, after which I'd have to whittle it down somewhat so that everything can fit ionto a 7-8 minute chapter. I have a rough idea of stuff that I <i>need</i> to cover, but the hard bit is coming up with a decent narrative in the first place, and then editing that down to fit the timeslots.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've also had a look at the songs of 1987. Whereas 1986 was a bumper year, 1987 really <i>really</i> isn't that good at all - very few decent songs on my shortlist. We'll see how it turns out...
<p>
<hr>
<p>
        <b>09/05/06:</b> 1986 is up!
<p>
<hr>
<p>
        <b>07/05/06:</b> Thought of something :) The intro animation has been rendered, and the tweaks have been made to the chapter content too. This is going to be the largest chapter by far: 8m55s long, but it's well worth it as 1986 was an eventful year. I've just finished mixing the soundtrack and caught myself dancing around the room to it on playback, so I'm sure it works :)<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I'm just converting the humungous uncompressed AVI movie files into an MPEG whilst mixing in the sound file, so will have something to view on my big telly within an hour! I really am quite excited about this! Once I've confirmed it's as funky as I think it's going to be, it will be released sometime this week, so keep 'em peeled!
<p>
<hr>
<p>
        <b>16/04/06:</b> Work on the intro has started...<br>
        <center><img src="1986_03.png"></center><br>
        ...but I'm still unsure what to do with it...
<p>
<hr>
<p>
        <b>20/03/06:</b> Compilation of the first draft MPEG is underway. Just six short hours to go, finishing roughly at 4am.<br>
        <center><IMG SRC="1986_02.png"></center><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just <i>know</i> I won't sleep tonight...
<p>
<hr>
<p>
        <b>19/03/06:</b> Just rendering the pans that will appear in the chapter at high quality, and that takes a few hours. It's rather frustrating as, once they're done, I'll be ready to assemble the draft of the chapter. That should be done tomorrow night, and soon after be passed onto my reviewers. In the meantime I'll be working on the intro which will be a little fancy.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
        <b>14/03/06:</b> I want to move many of the animations that appear within a chapter into a 3D setting rather than a 2D one. There will of course be times where a 2D setting is more applicable (e.g. the cross-fades of magazine adverts) but a 3D setting adds a bit of shine to the proceedings.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like this:<br>
        <center><IMG SRC="cases.png"></center><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not bad, and it looks rather good when animated too. Whilst I've been working on that, I've also been collecting together the last of the Speccy games footage and have chosen which portions to use in the chapter. All I need to do with those now is to edit the footage and extract the sections as sequences of image files.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've also been thinking about what music to use for the soundtrack, and I'm pretty excited about that as I don't think one of the tracks was released in the UK, but it's so awesome that it has to be used, and I'll be using that for the intro. Also I'll be using a track which was a recent (re)discovery that was effectively a one-hit wonder but is <i>very</i> rarely played on the radio these days, and yet it's utterly brilliant.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I really am looking forward to seeing this as a finished chapter as I think it could be the best one yet!

        <b>07/03/06:</b> The house move is complete, the new job started, the dust settled, and I'm starting to have some energy again to do fun things. Have re-drafted the 1986 script, and made the decision to make this a slightly extended chapter of 8.5 mins like the 1983 chapter was as a lot happened in 1986, not least of which was the Amstrad buy-out. I've also started gathering bits of video together and have almost all the footage I need. This week I also hope to do a few bits of animation for the chapter contents. It's looking promising...
<p>
<hr>
<p>
        <b>28/01/06:</b> Work on 1986 has started, although I'm ever-so-slightly distracted right now due to going through a job change and house move (again), so I'm not <i>entirely</i> focused on it, but it's a nice escape from everything. No real problems with the new chapter beyond the usual condensing problems. I'm currently trying to describe the Amstrad buy-out in 21 seconds. Not easy... currently got it down to 40 seconds.<br>
