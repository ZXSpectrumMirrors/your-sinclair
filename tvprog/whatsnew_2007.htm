	<b>14/11/07:</b> So much for using 1989 as a relaxation aid - the house-move preparations are turning my brain to mush, so little's been done on the chapter. However, when I <i>can</i> get it together enough to sit down in front of my home PC and concentrate, I work on the chapter intro animation. Early days yet, but here's a teaser frame:<p>
<center><IMG SRC="city.png"></center><p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chapter definitely won't get done by Xmas unless a miracle happens. Maybe a Spring 2008 release.
<p>

<p>
	<b>30/09/07:</b> I'm on the move again with yet another house-move iminent. Hopefully this will be the last one for a few years. The flip-side of this is that I'm using 1989 chapter development as a relaxation aid, and quite a bit's been done this weekend as a result. The story-board is very close to being finalised, and I've just grabbed and edited a lot of in-game footage. Looks like the chapter will be around 7.5 mins long this time as 1989 was the year that things started to cool down a little. Next up: thinking up what animations to create for this chapter.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
	<b>22/09/07:</b> No news regarding the 1989 chapter, I'm afraid - Real Life Stuff is getting in the way - however I've just created a <a href="gallery.htm">Gallery page</a> containing high-definition rederings of a few scenes from the 3D animations within the documentary that you can use as desktop wallpaper, or just want to view if you're curious about what's in each scene. Scenes are rendered at both 1920x1200 and 1600x1200 and are available to download as both PNGs and JPEGs. The PNGs are startling when viewed full-screen.

	<b>16/08/07:</b> With the <a href="http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/cover1.htm">massive YSRnRY update</a> done and dusted, work on 1989 has started. Already got a draft script, just needs tidying up - a 1.5 minute tirade about the pamphletization of CRASH should probably be rewritten ;)
<p>
<hr>
<p>
	<b>24/04/07:</b> 1988 went down rather well! But there will now be a short intermission whilst I work on something else over the spring and summer. 1989 will probably appear this autumn/winter.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what am I working on? I suggest you check the front page here on August 16th to find out :)
<p>

<p>
	<b>23/04/07:</b> It's out today as part of the ZX Spectrum 25th Anniversary celebrations - enjoy!
<p>
<hr>
<p>
	<b>21/04/07:</b> The intro animation for the 1988 chapter is now rendering, and for the rest of this evening I'll be doing some final twiddles to the chapter content leaving tomorrow for putting together the soundtrack. A Monday release is looking <i>very</i> possible indeed!
<p>
<hr>
<p>
	<b>31/03/07:</b> The preview version's done :)<br>
<center><IMG SRC="1988_1.png"></center><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now just planning the intro animation, which will be in 3D, but in an abstract style similar to the intros of the first few chapters. The aim is to get it done by around April 23rd - the Speccy's 25th anniversary.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
	<b>18/03/07:</b> All 2D and 3D animations that appear within the chapter have been done, and I'm within spitting distance of putting together the draft chapter. I think for the first time in ages, I might actually have time to spare in the chapter to add a few more games. Will hopefully have the draft chapter done by the end of the week (just a few bits of game footage to get first, plus a bit of script editing and then producing all the captions), and I'm definitely looking at an April release to coincide with the Speccy's 25th anniversary. Even the intro animation is sort-of-planned and should be done by then.
<p>

<p>
	<b>19/02/07:</b> A quick update about what's been happening for the past two months. Two 3D animations have been completed, and will form part of the 1988 chapter content. I've also started collecting together the game footage (although if anyone can send me an RZX of gameplay from The Muncher, Virus, Bedlam or Firefly I'd be very grateful as I'm rubbish at those games!), so the chapter is filling out quite nicely. I still need to rewrite a couple of the sections as they're still a little flabby - although fifty seconds of 80's-style scantily-clad women and big hair would probably get a fair bit of support - and I've also got a good idea of what I want to have as the intro animation. All in all, we <i>could</i> be looking at an April release.
