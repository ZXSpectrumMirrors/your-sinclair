		<b>12/12/04:</b> Spent a happy weekend working on the soundtrack. Was trickier than usual as there's one section partway into the soundtrack that must start at a particular point, and it meant dicing up some of the songs so that they'd fit together in the allotted time. As a result some song samples are hoverring around the one-minute mark, whereas usually I like to hover around the 1:20 or 1:30 mark.<p>
		I wasn't as happy with it when I'd completed it compared to the other soundtracks, but on repeated listenings (think over and over and over and...) it grew on me, so I think it'll work for you :)<p>
		The file size is at 77Mb, and lasts 7min 20sec, which is roughly halfway in between the lengths of the 1982 and 1983 chapters. Still not sure if it's too long or not, but with 1Mb broadband becoming increasingly popular, and affordable 8Mb broadband arriving next year, it's becoming less of a worry.<p>
		I'm currently sorting out the distribution mechanisms, so hopefully I'll be able to officially release it within the next few days.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
		<b>5/12/04:</b> The video is now complete, and really does look quite good. Including intro animation it is 7min 20secs long, and has a rather pleasing frame total of precisely 11,000. This week I intend to brainwash myself with songs from 1984 so that I can create the soundtrack next weekend and hopefully get this out before Christmas.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
		<b>3/11/04:</b> Ah. Due to various "interesting" computer problems, followed by buying an Xbox with World Class Snooker 2004, Links 2004, and (*pant*) OutRun 2, things have got a tad delayed :) But I'm back on the job again. The 1984 draft went down well, and needs a bit of tweaking. I'm now working on something special for the intro animation which I really <i>really</i> want to tell you about, but don't want to spoil the surprise. So, here's a teaser: can you guess what this is all about?:<p>
		<center><IMG SRC="last_bite.gif"></center><p>
		You'll find out soon :)
<p>
<hr>
<p>
		<b>7/9/04:</b> Now it's the fun part :) I'm just compiling up the first draft of the 1984 chapter to see what it looks like, how it flows, things like that. I'm still waiting on a couple of things, but nothing I can't work around if I need to. I've re-jigged the text dissolves so that they're now horizontal wipes - you'll know what I mean when you see it. This approach also gives me a lot more flexibility when it comes to editing as there isn't a merge of two text sets anymore. <p>
		Errr, again, you'll know what I mean when you see it.<p>
		Once I've done the twiddling I want to, I'll then send it to my trusty band of testers to rip apart and help me perfect, then all I need to do is add an intro animation (currently seeking inspiration...) and then a soundtrack (this is the easiest and most enjoyable part).<p>
		It's looking good :)<p><center><img src="1984_01.png"></center>

		<b>30/8/04:</b> Now just tidying up the script for the 1984 chapter. The current problem is one of verbosity - trying to pass as much information as possible in the shortest amount of text. It's quite an art! Currently the projected length of 1984 is around 7.5 minutes, but I'm not happy with it. Some sections take up too much time, so i have to hack away at the text to make it shorter without losing too much info, and also preserve the flow of the chapter. It's getting there... Ideally it will be around 6.5 to 7 mins long, but we'll see how it goes...<p>
		This chapter will also be the first one with actual video in, something which won't be unique to this chapter. It'll be original stuff, or Sinclair stuff, so there won't be any rights issues, etc. It'll be a nice addition to everything - I get the feeling it will be interesting watching the techniques used to generate each chapter as they get developed over time. The final chapter could be quite swish :) I can definitely tell you that this is fun to do, and I encourage everyone to give this sort of thing a try. I think it's the next generation of website content: broadband movies.<p>
		I'm also starting on a Perl 3D animation package - I've designed everything, I just have to sit down and code it. It's quite simple really, but in a complicated way. I won't give a timescale for completion, or even any good example movies. My current guestimate is around the time the 1985 chapter is developed, so we're talking start of 2005, or thereabouts. Maybe. This could be a flop for all I know... I <i>do</i> know that it's going to be done before the 1987 chapter as I want to use it in the intro animation for that chapter. We shall see. Everything looks simple at this stage, but that's when the ground usually falls away at your feet.

		<b>11/7/04:</b> The soundtrack's done, now just sorting out the distribution, and you'll be able to download it by the time you see this :)
<p>
<hr>
<p>
		<b>27/6/04:</b> A quick progress update - I've just this minute finished the intro animation (it's a goody, and also one of the most complicated ones I've done before, hence the slight delay) and now I'm going to do the final twiddles to the content itself before working on the soundtrack. I expect the MPEG to be ready for download within a couple of weeks, barring any unforeseen incidents such as the lightning storm outside frazzling my network...
<p>
<hr>
<p>
		<b>10/6/04:</b> If you want to use the scripts I use to build the animations, I've thrown together a <a href="http://obdwww.egyptus.co.uk/perlanim/">webpage</a> which has a download and very brief documentation.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
		<b>6/6/04:</b> All footage for 1983 has been assembled and the first draft MPEG is being generated as I type. This chapter will be eight minutes long, plus the length the the intro animation that's still to be added - this should be the longest chapter as it's more historical than primarily about the games. 1983 was when the whole third-party scene started up for the Spectrum and so there's a lot to cover. No soundtrack has been put together yet, but I've got a shortlist of about 30 songs I want to listen to and ponder where and how to use them. But until I've sorted that out, I'll just be tinkering with the animation itself.<p>

<b>8/5/04:</b> The 1982 chapter went down rather well! The feedback has been amazing, and that's given me the 
encouragment to dive into the next chapter for 1983.<p>
<center><IMG SRC="1983_01.png"></center><p>

Originally the chapter for 1983 was going to be very short. When I wrote the first draft it was the end of 2002 and I didn't actually have much in the way of source material for 1983, so I thought that very little happened of note during that year.<p>

Then WOS put up scans of 1983-vintage Sinclair User magazines and boy was I proven wrong. 1983 is an <i>incredibly</i> important year in Sinclair history, it was when the whole third-party industry started up and anything and everything was tried out in the hope of making some serious money. Just reading the SU's for that year filled me with wave upon wave of nostalgia, <i>and I wasn't even around at that time to enjoy it firsthand</i>!<p>

Obviously the script I had for 1983 has to be rewritten to give a much <i>much</i> better account of what happened back then, and I've now completed that and started turning it into captions that will form the basis of the 1983 chapter.<p>

Boy this is going to be a good one...

<p>

<p>
<b>2/4/04:</b> The webpages for the section on the documentary have been re-jigged and the first chapter is launched! Both BitTorrent and eDonkey are supported on the P2P side, together with the bog-standard download link to the MPEG. We'll see how it all holds up - I'm quite tempted to go purely P2P in future. 
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<b>28/3/04:</b> After a few delays installing and reinstalling the new Linux box (called Frodo), I've now got around to editing together a soundtrack, and the final MPEG is ready! 68Mb in size, but well worth it. I ended up using Audacity to edit and mix the sound files under Linux, and it was incredibly good at it. I got fed up of the sound editor that came with Nero GPF-ing.<p>
So, it looks like I never needed Adobe Premiere after all. You live and learn :)<p>
Now all I have to do is draw up a few webpages (basically this section needs a new redeisgn now there's something to download), set up a BitTorrent stream as well as any other useful P2P sources, and it should be ready to launch.<p>

Give it a few days, and all will finally be revealed!
<p>

<b>25/1/04:</b> Everything's going <i>very</i> well. A preview movie has been generated for all the content for 1982 and seems to have gone
down well. A few tweaks need to be done, most notably the smoothness of the panning. A workaround is in place, but that will involve a lot
more processing time, so I've just ordered a PC to handle that for me. Currently I render on a 128Mb P3-500 Win98 box, but soon that
will be replaced with a 256Mb AMD 1.3GHz Linux box, so processing times should speed up rather well. Porting of the scripts should be
quite simple as they're Perl scripts which call Netpbm and Imagemagick toolkits, both of which originally came from *nix operating systems. Quite 
looking forward to seeing how it performs - been told it could be as much as four times faster than my current set-up!<P>

Right this minute I'm rendering the intro animation, which should be pretty cool. I won't display it here as I want all the content to be a
surprise from now on. My thoughts are now turning to the soundtrack, which will be a mix of songs from 1982. Got quite a long shortlist
right now, just need to go through each track one by one to see what I can sample. I'm assuming that no one would mind me sampling up to
a minute or so from each track judging from my experiences with the Bond Flash animation you see when you enter the website.<p>

It's all coming together...
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<b>9/1/04:</b> We have footage! I've used the panning and animation scripts to create all the footage for the 1982 chapter and joined it
all together. Not including the animation intro (20-30 secs that I haven't done yet, but have planned), the resulting movie file comes in
at 6 min 8 secs long. I've still to add on the captions below the footage, and also a sound track, yet the resulting MPEG is already 68Meg!!
I'll have to look into some file optimisation as I really don't want to cut the movie - I mean, what's the point? This is targeted at
broadband users who have always-on access, so long-ish download times are OK.<p>

I've viewed the MPEG as a VCD on my big screen TV. It looks quite cool :) Everything's clear and smooth, and the images come out really well.
And the footage I recorded of Spectrum gameplay? Astounding, even for the games of 1982 vintage. VU3D's shading process looks REALLY good on
a big screen.<p>

The file size is still worrying me a little. I had hoped it would all fit on a VCD. But.. DVD writers have just halved in price. Dabs.com are selling
them for &pound;85 now, and that can only get lower, so I'm thinking of just worrying about doing a DVD thingy. It'll give me chance to have
some fun making menu systems and extras and stuff in future :)<p>

I'm getting quite excited!
