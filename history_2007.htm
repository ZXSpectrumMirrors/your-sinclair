Decades. Plural. Erk.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Cheese Factor Four please, Mr Sulu... better get a paper bag handy..."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wouldn't it be great if you could browse the YS page image scans stored on the <a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/">World Of Spectrum website</a> at the same time as reading the articles on the YSRnRY website?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well (you knew this was coming, didn't you?), now you can! Embedded on each webpage is now a virtual YS, already opened out in your web browser on the page you're currently reading. Click on the relevant page and see the original from way-back-when. I hope you get as big a thrill out of seeing those double-page spreads as I did the first time I saw them!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But! You've already read all the pages on the YSRnRY website (but of course... ahem...) - why go through them all again?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You've got me there. (Damn.)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know! <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (fx: three month's worth of keyboard tapping)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The cheese is too strong, Captain! The stomach cannot hold on any longer!"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How about a few more old articles to read - say, 750-odd? That's almost all the full-sized reviews, with a fair amount of previews, other articles and bits and bobs thrown in. (I never want to see another scanner for several years) For those of you keeping count, that's almost 1,900 reviews, previews and features in total now. There's a simple list of the new articles <a href="articles/20070816new.htm">on this page</a>.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But what about the articles which aren't scanned?" I hear you say. Or it could be just the cheese fumes getting to me. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aha, I thought of that. Everything in YS has been catalogued. Everything. What this means is that the issue summary pages have lots of natty "PAGE" icons - click on one of these and it'll take you directly to the page scan of the review/preview/feature/whatever that is next to the icon.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Want to read the "Street Life" in issue 32? Not a problem - you now have a one-touch interface to everything in YS from the relevant issue summary page. A virtual YS, indeed!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enjoy! <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PS. I'm not too bothered about the odd typo - with so much text scanned in, it's inevitable really - but let me know if you see any HTML oddities. I've done a bit of tweaking here and there, and some browsers might choke beyond reasonable expectations...<br>

<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">3rd May 2007</FONT></b> : The interview went OK-ish (you can now hear it on the BBC's ListenAgain site, just look for Wednesday's Adam Walton Show on BBC Radio Wales (not Cymru). I think <i>now</i> you know why the documentary doesn't have me doing a voice-over ;) Still, it was fun, and I loved waxing lyrical on something I'm surprisingly passionate about.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Meanwhile...</i> I'm very surprised with myself that I haven't plugged this book, considering I wrote part of it!<br><center><IMG SRC="zx_spectrum_book.jpg"></center><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a 256-page full-colour book containing a history of the games scene during the whole life of the Speccy. It has a foreward by Sir Clive Sinclair himself and also each year-by-year chapter has an introduction page written by myself reviewing the industry during that year.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has a limited print-run of 1,000 copies, and the last I heard there are under 200 copies left, so go get one from <a href="http://www.zxgoldenyears.com/">www.zxgoldenyears.com</a>!<br>

<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">1st May 2007</FONT></b> : <B>STOP PRESS!</B> I'll be appearing on the Adam Walton show tomorrow (Wed May 2nd) between 9pm and 10pm on <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/radiowales/">BBC Radio Wales</a> talking about the Sinclair Spectrum on its 25th Anniversary.<br>

<IMG ALIGN="RIGHT" SRC="zxfbut2.gif"><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">24th April 2007</FONT></b> : You can't miss this: the superlative <a href="http://zxf.magazine.googlepages.com/">ZX Format</a> has produced a special 25th Anniversary issue. For latecomers, ZXF is a fanzine in PDF format that covers pretty much everything in the Speccy and SAM retroscene, edited and mainly written by friend-of-the-site Colin Woodcock. The 'zine has always been a damned good read, and this latest issue reminded me of just how much I missed it since it went on hiatus.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the return of YS3 and ZXF, the 25th Anniversary celebrations have been incredibly fun to be part of.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><b>Later...</b></i> By the way, development on the 1989 chapter will be delayed until later this year. In the meantime, I'll be working on something else. What is it? You'll have to check back here on August 16th to find out :)<br>

<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">23rd April 2007</FONT></b> : <b>Today is the 25th Anniversary of the launch of the Sinclair Spectrum!</b><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, as part of those celebrations, <a href="tvprog/downloads.htm">here's the 1988 chapter of the documentary</a> to download and enjoy.<br><center><IMG SRC="tvprog/1988_2.png"></center><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marvel at the return of full-colour games! Cringe as Amstrad ruins the Sinclair brand with the PC200! Drool at the sexy computer game artwork! Cheer as you celebrate Christmas in April! And jump for joy as Ocean achieves sheer brilliance!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This chapter comes in at 8m11s as a 81.7MB download, and takes the total duration up to 54m35s - the next chapter will take it over the one-hour mark! Not bad considering I was wondering right at the very start if I'd manage to stretch it to thirty minutes...<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enjoy, and <a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/forums/showthread.php?t=15629">keep an eye out</a> for other 25th Anniversary celebrations this week!<br>

<IMG ALIGN=right SRC="ys3tiny.gif"><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">15th April 2007</FONT></b> : A couple of items of news. First of all, <a href="http://www.ys3.org">YS3 is back!</a>. Nat Cross and team return, this time with a blog of new articles rather than publishing the odd set in individual issues. Just had a very pleasurable time laughing out loud to the first few entries. Long may it continue...<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other bit of news is that the 1988 chapter of the <a href="tvprog/index.htm">documentary</a> will be out in the next week or two to coincide with the 25th anniversary of the Sinclair Spectrum's release.<br>
