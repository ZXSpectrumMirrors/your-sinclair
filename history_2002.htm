<!-- START -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">24th October 2002</FONT></b> : The new issue of <a href="http://www.ys3.co.uk/">YS3</a> is out! You can read old back issues <a href="http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/ys3/">here</a>.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">4th September 2002</FONT></b> : Just bought myself a nice 19" monitor, so my screen resolution is now 1600x1200, and I've now noticed that the <a href="movies/index.htm">Movies</a> are fixed at 400x300, which is titchy on my screen! So, I've added a little bit of Javascript so that the size of the movie will be automatically resized to fill as much of your browser window as possible. For those of you without Javascript capable browsers, there's a link at the bottom of each movie page that will take you to the old version of the webpage with the fixed sizes. A word of warning - the larger the size of your movie, the more processing power needed from your computer. If the movie's choppy, then make your browser window smaller and hit Refresh and try that.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">23rd August 2002</FONT></b> : A little something I knocked up myself - I noticed that the magazines I have in original YS binders have been damaged over time by the wire that goes down the centre of the mags. So... I made my own binders! <a href="diy/index.htm">Here's how to make your own binders</a>, and they really do look rather good!<br><center><IMG SRC="diy/allbinders.jpg"></center><br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">14th July 2002</FONT></b> : Oh my god, how brilliant is THIS?! And how could this have been kept quiet from me for so long?! Some wonderful person has remade <a href="articles/moleychristmas.htm">Moley Christmas</a>, the last real Monty Mole game that was a YS exclusive (I don't class <a href="articles/impossamole.htm">Impossamole</a> as a Monty Mole game).<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Written for Windows too, which is good as I don't have any soundcard drivers for DOS anymore. You can <a href="http://www.space-time.remakes.org/moley.htm">get the remake here</a>. At 5Mb, it's a bit of a hefty download, but well worth it - plenty of good graphics and music. You'll also need CNCS32.DLL, which you can <a href="http://otakuworld.com/toys/index.html?/toys/utils.html">download from here</a>. A damn fine remake.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a lot happening with the YSRnRY - lots of things to do, but no time to do them in. Hey ho...<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">9th June 2002</FONT></b> : Remember the <a href="articles/personalitytest.htm">Online YS Personality Test</a>? Now you can find out <a href="/cgi-bin/mraverage.pl">what the average YSRnRY visitor is like</a>. Just under a thousand people have taken the test so far.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">2nd June 2002</FONT></b> : A nice little feature has been added. At the bottom of most game articles is now a box containing ratings given to that game by Crash and Sinclair User. The data's extracted from Jim Grimwood's excellent <a href="http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~jimg/spot-on/default.htm">SPOT</a> database of all things Sinclair, and (if available) there's also a hyperlink to the relevant review in <a href="http://www.crashonline.co.uk/">Crash Online</a> and/or <a href="http://www.sincuser.f9.co.uk/">SUMO - Sinclair User Magazine Online</a>. I hope you like it.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paul Jenkinson has added more screenshots to our database.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">28th April 2002</FONT></b> : A sizeable update even though it required little work from myself. Paul Jenkinson has returned and has provided us with a heap of screenshots for games featured in YS32-36. Three Virtual Competitions have been added by myself.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've also added a new page dedicated to <a href="onlinegames.htm">Online Games</a> that are currently on the site. There's eight of them so far, with some more to come any decade now. Some are Java applets, some are straight interactive webpages. Have a gander and see what you like.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another new page is the <a href="memorabilia.htm">YS Memorabilia</a> page. This contains various odds and sods like YS stickers and various souvenirs. Many thanks to Matthew Carrier for providing these.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">23rd April 2002</FONT></b> : Apparently today is the 20th anniversary of the launch of the ZX Spectrum!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Later:</i> Thought I might as well get this done as it's the 20th Anniversary - added <a href="articles/compo0386.htm">The Enormous, Huge, Wonderful, Ace, Triffic, Supersonic, Fab, Over-The-Top, Incredible, Far-Out, Mind-Blowing, Absolutely Ginormous, Mega-Brill YS Compo!</a> Just a bit of fun - I'll be ressurecting some of the old (and funnier) YS Megacompos. It's all interactive, so you too could win a virtual prize! All prize winners get a namecheck on the relevant Compo Winners page.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">31st March 2002</FONT></b> : Feeling bored? Try a <a href="/cgi-bin/random.pl">Random Page</a> - you might discover something you never knew about.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">3rd March 2002</FONT></b> : More twiddling. Updated the <a href="seeking.htm">Desperately Seeking...</a> page to list all the YS writers I'm still trying to track down to ask about permissions. If you are one of the people listed, or know what some of them are doing now, please <a href="email.htm">email me</a> and let me know.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">24th February 2002</FONT></b> : More tidying up, fixed a few broken links, and reinstated the <a href="megagames.htm">Megagames page</a>.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">17th February 2002</FONT></b> : Added some arcade screenshots for <i>Psycho Pigs UXB</i> (aka <i>Pigs And Bombers</i> aka <i>Butasan</i>), <i>Firetrap</i>, <i>Jackal</i>, <i>Last Duel</i>, <i>Motos</i>, <i>Chase HQ II - Special Criminal Investigation</i>, <i>Shadow Warriors</i> and <i>Space Gun</i>. You'll find them all in the <a href="mame/index.htm">Arcade Screenshots Gallery</a>, and I've made all the screenshots magnifiable like I did with the Spectrum screenshots a while back.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've also made the indexes more complete, and also twiddled about with the <a href="articles/peopleindex.htm">Articles by Author</a> section so that every article that is credited is listed against the correct name.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">9th February 2002</FONT></b> : Something quite nifty has been added to the site: the <a href="articles/personalitytest.htm">YS Personality Test</a> has been put online, and is fully interactive! Just fill in the questionaire, it will tell you what you're like, and it can explain to you how it reached its conclusions!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those of you who are into 80's nostalgia in general, a new Usenet newsgroup has been created called uk.culture.nostalgia.1980s. Quite a fun little group already, come join us!<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">3rd February 2002</FONT></b> : The bandwidth used by this site was starting to rocket, so I've had to put a few controls in. "Normal" browsers shouldn't see any change. However. those websites who link directly to images on this website will now find that those links do not work. Also, <i>any</i> links to the Arcade Screenshot gallery will not work. The galleries were using up 1.5Gb of my bandwidth a month (my maximum is 8Gb), so I've had to restrict access to those and all other images to only those people who are viewing this website for it's text content. These restrictions are <i>permanent</i> and generally non-negotiable.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Links to webpages themselves (ending in .htm) will work as normal.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you're a webmaster who has links to this website and those links have suddenly stopped working, and the reason isn't explained above, <a href="email.htm">email me</a> and I'll take another look at the rules.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">29th January 2002</FONT></b> : Added <a href="articles/holdhand.htm">Whistlin' Rick's autograph</a>.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">27th January 2002</FONT></b> : Decided to do some optimising with regard to the arcade screenshot slideshows in the article pages. These were very bandwidth-intensive, worst-case being <a href="articles/paperboy.htm">Paperboy</a> whose slideshow totaled more than 500K of screenshots. So, I've replaced those slideshows with a simple CGI script that will display a random arcade screenshot for that game, and have a link below it to the separate page with all the arcade screens on. The Arcade pics were taking up about 1.2Gb of bandwidth a month as well (and growing), so I thought I better put in a tweak sooner rather than later.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Later:</i> Just added the Nokia ringtone version of <a href="articles/holdhand.htm">Hold My Hand Very Tightly</a>! Amaze your friends ;)<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">13th January 2002</FONT></b> : Small update - the Vision On Real Audio clip in the <a href="photos/index.htm">Photos</a> section has been fixed - it wasn't working ever since the move to a new webserver in July 2000! And, due to popular demand, you can now download <a href="articles/holdhand.htm">Hold My Hand Very Tightly (Very Tightly)</a> by Whistlin' Rick, and sing along with the lyrics in true Smash Hits fashion! 80's nostalgia for all the family!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spook fact: There are now 2,133 pages on this website.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">1st January 2002</FONT></b> : <b><font color=red>HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!</font></b> The Stats for 2001 are in. Including robots, this site got 1,310,329 hits and 308,156 visitors. Excluding robots from the calculations, the site got 463,113 hits and 253,577 visitors. More details <a href="stats/index.htm">here</a>.<br>
