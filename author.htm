			Born in 1974 in the States, Nick moved over to Britain with the rest of his family when he was five years old. 
			He got his first computer in 1985, a Sinclair Spectrum 48k+, and used this to teach himself programming. He started reading YS in 1987,
			loved it from the start and picked up as many issues as he could, and stopped reading it sometime in 1992 when most shops decided not to 
			sell it any more. By this time, he had already bought one of the doomed SAM Coupes in which he started selling his own programs under the 
			name Cursor Productions, as a result of which he made the princely sum of 28p.<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After SAM Computers Ltd went under in 1992, Nick acquired an 8086 PC and his Spectrum and SAM gaming days ended.
			He then went to Liverpool University to study for a Computer Science degree. It was during this time 
			that he discovered the Spectrum emulation scene - indeed he had many a happy hour playing games on his 8086 PC with the Z80 Spectrum emulator running at all of 23% speed. Once the scene had been established,
			he set to work on the YS Rock'n'Roll Years in 1997 - the website you're now reading. He also helped set up <a href="http://www.the-tipshop.co.uk/">The Tipshop</a>
			with Gerard Sweeney in May 2001.<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nick leads a fairly nomadic lifestyle - he'd tell you whereabouts he lives and what sort of job he's doing, but that will probably have changed by the time that you read this. It's probably a safe bet to say he's in Britain right now, but it would be a safer bet that he's currently somewhere in the Northern Hemisphere. <br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably.
