<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">6th December 2005</FONT></b> : I'm getting reports that <b>RetroGamer is back from the dead!</b> Live!'s administrators have sold the title to the spookily-named Imagine Publishing, and a new issue is out NOW!<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<center><img src="tvprog/1985_3.png"></center><br><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">5th December 2005</FONT></b> : <b>1985 documentary chapter <a href="tvprog/downloads.htm">out now!</a></b> It's 7m22s long, a 73.5Mb download, features the rise of wireframe vector graphics, the wobble of Sinclair Research, and the birth of Your Sinclair. 'Tis rather nifty...<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">24th August 2005</FONT></b> : <b>RetroGamer is no more.</b> Live! Publishing went into administration on Monday and all of their mags, including RG, are unlikely to return.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's a damned shame. RetroGamer was a good read, although perhaps a little too expensive at &pound;5.99 an issue. However, RG was successful - Live! Publishing was brought down by the failure of other mags in their stable. It was of course RG who brought back YS for a special one-off issue (although a second was rumoured to be in the works), and for this alone they'll be fondly remembered.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Best wishes to all involved, and I hope those freelancers who didn't get paid won't be put off writing again.<br>

<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">24th June 2005</FONT></b> : <b><font color=red>2,000,000 UP!!</font></b> Lumme. 1,000,000 visits over the past 2 1/4 years. Still not much new on the site, but there's interesting developments on the <a href="tvprog/">documentary</a>, and the next chapter is hoped to be out of the door by the end of July as the 3D animation package I'm working on is nearing completion. But still... look at all those zeroes ;)<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">1st January 2005</FONT></b> : Happy New Year! 2004 has been quite productive for me as it finally saw the release of the first three chapters of the <a href="tvprog/index.htm">TV Show</a> that I've been working on (in one way or another) since the end of 2002. Three chapters (1982, 1983 and 1984) were completed in 2004, and I wish I could say how many would get done in 2005 as there are quite a few variables in my life right now, the main geeky one being finally getting around to writing a 3D animation package that I want to use for the intro to the 1985 chapter. A conservative estimate is two chapters plus the new animation package, or it could be as many as four or five should a few things happen in the right order in my life.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Anyway...</i> this is all a rambling way of telling you the stats for 2004: 702,890 hits from 399,135 visitors, down 20% from 2003, and around 10% down from 2002, probably explainable by my concentration on the documentary rather than on new additions to the archive or any new online games that would get blogged around the world. No big deal, and I think the numbers will stabilise over the next two or three years whilst I continue on the documentary.<br>
