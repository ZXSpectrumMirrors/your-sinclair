<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">26th September 2010</FONT></b> : <b>"Our Work Here Is Done."</b><IMG SRC="WORKDONE.JPG" ALIGN="RIGHT"><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After eight years working on the documentary, thirteen years on this website, and coming up to eighteen years in the Speccy retroscene, it's time to take a bow and move on to other things.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I started this website in the hope of relating the excitement surrounding the Christmas hype cycle each year of the Speccy's life, from the first murmurs of festive megagames in the spring, to the all-singing all-dancing hype, previews and marketing campaigns of the eventual launches at the end of the year. The main website went a little way towards doing that, but it wasn't until last year's completion of the Christmas Special video and its accompanying Advent Calendar website feature that I felt that Christmas had finally had the coverage it deserved on this website.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the recent release of the 1990 documentary chapter, I also feel that the 1982-1990 period has been well covered, and I think now is a good time to draw a line underneath it all and move on to other things - things which are not Speccy-related.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd like to thank everyone who has helped out with the website, with special thanks to World Of Spectrum webmaster Martijn van der Heide - without his vast archive of Speccy stuff, most of my Speccy-related contributions would simply not have happened. I'd also like to thank the original Your Sinclair team for creating such a legendary magazine, and for many of them giving this site their blessing. I'd also like to thank those people in the Dennis and Future Publishing camps for all their kind comments, and for not sending me a cease-and-desist during all these years!<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's been one hell of a ride, but it's time to get off and try something else. But you never know with Speccy stuff - there's always going to be that urge for "just one more go"...<br><hr>

<IMG SRC="tvprog/1990menu.jpg" ALIGN="RIGHT"><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">27th August 2010</FONT></b> : The 1990 documentary chapter is now <a href="tvprog/downloads.htm#1990">available for download!</a> It's exactly nine minutes long, and covers the accelerating decay of the Speccy scene. See the rise of corporatism! The flood of football games! The wave of puzzle games! And how Amstrad ignores the Spectrum whilst other companies try to succeed it!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ahem. Don't worry, it's not too depressing - there's some good stuff to see in this chapter. Enjoy! Total playing time is now 1h50m.<br>

<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">4th August 2010</FONT></b> : Matthew Wilson has sent in the letter he received with his YS badge after getting a letter published in the magazine. I've added it to the <a href="memorabilia.htm">Memorabilia page</a>.<br>

<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">17th June 2010</FONT></b> : Been having a few ideas whilst my network has been down. The first was the Daily Fix, and now the <a href="/m/">YSRnRY Mobile Edition</a> - a stripped-down version of this website for mobile phone users. Point your phone's web browser at <b>http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/m/</b> in order to view all the reviews and previews that are on this site, indexed by letter and magazine issue. This is my first crack at a mobile website and have no idea what's expected of one, so it's all a bit bog standard - any ideas or suggestions welcome. I'm pretty sure there must be a way of jazzing it up a little!<br>

<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">13th June 2010</FONT></b> : Two YS cover badges have been added to the <a href="memorabilia.htm">Memorabilia</a> page, courtesy of Stephen Foster.<br>

<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">8th June 2010</FONT></b> : Introducing the <a href="/cgi-bin/daily.pl">Daily YS Fix</a> - every day a review or preview is selected from a YS issue that was published in the current month, giving a seasonal taster of the Speccy scene way-back-when, together with a healthy slice of YS-ness. A nice way to start your day. Or your lunch. Or end your day.<br>

<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">30th January 2010</FONT></b> : High quality versions of the regular documentary chapters (1982-1989) are now available via BitTorrent and YouTube. More details on the <a href="tvprog/downloads.htm">Documentary Downloads page</a>.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">14th January 2010</FONT></b> : The final version of the Christmas Special is now available for download via both WWW and BitTorrent methods, and the YouTube videos have been refreshed. Get yourself to the <a href="tvprog/downloads.htm">Downloads page</a> and help yourself!<br>
