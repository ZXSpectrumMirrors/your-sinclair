Tch. No sooner had I removed my coat than the boss shoved this one in my lap. <I>(No he didn't - you don't have a boss - Ed)</I> "Ooooh, a classic!" I thought. "Should be a nice, easy one to do". Surely, every Spec-chum (or someone who spent more than the average time huddled over the arcade machine, dropping in enough 10p's to actually own the machine twice over) should know the plot of this game. George, Lizzy and Ralph managed to eat one of Ying-Tang's radioactive Plutonium curries. However, instead of the normal night on the porcelain throne, they got mutated into three erm… famous monster (but not quite so) things. <I>(Listen, do it properly - Ed)</I>

Oh, Okay then. Our three heroes were in some kind of nuclear explosion. I think - it really was that long ago since I played it. George got turned into a giant gorilla/ape type thing, Lizzy turned into a huge lizard (shock!) and poor Ralph turned into a rather large wolf. Now, obviously, they were a little peeved about this so they decided to take their anger out on the poor people of America. And what better way to get rid of your anger and frustration? Yep, you've guessed it - knock down buildings and crush as many innocent bystanders as possible. But alas, it's not that simple. The Army have already heard about your plans, and are out to send you back to your human-like state by sapping your energy.

You can lose this in many ways - being shot either by the helicopters that fly around, or the tanks that trundle along the floor, having stuff thrown at you from the people within the buildings you're levelling, falling off the top of the building, eating something within the building, or by being hit by one of your opponents. Anyway, I loaded it up, for the first time in about 9 years, and I really, really couldn't believe my eyes. The game I had spent most of my childhood over just suddenly looked… well, crap. Firstly, the characters look nothing like they were supposed to. Well, all except George, he vaguely resembles a giant ape. But Lizzy &amp; Ralph just look like blobs with feet. And not nice blobs at that. The gameplay also seems more watered down compared to the excellent arcade version. Gone are the small extras, such as the river and the little manhole covers you could flip up and play with.

After about the third level, you've seen the entire game. They're the same buildings, same backgrounds, same power-ups, etc. However, it's still jolly good fun when you have mates round, and you're all sat around the Speccy trying to play. Of course, except when you're playing next to someone you don't like, and they're trying to prevent you from hitting your part of the keyboard. Redefine the keys right, and you're almost guaranteed to get a free game of Twister!

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>LIFE EXPECTANCY: 43% Once you've seen one, you've seen them all basically.</P>
<P>GRAPHICS: 57% - They're a bit basic, and the main characters are terrible.</P>
<P>SOUND: 32% - "Ckch" when you hit the buildings, "Bmm" when you hit someone, and "Ckch, ckch, ckch, ckch" when the buildings fall down.</P>
<P>GAMEPLAY: 74% It's certainly refreshing and a blast with two mates.</P>
<P>Summary: Overall, it's not a BAD game, it's just a bit too… well, samey! Fun for about half an hour until you realise you've been there before.</P>
