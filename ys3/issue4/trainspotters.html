Hello and good evening! Well, this is a bit of a surprise, you people springing out at me from nowhere... For a moment there I thought you were a homeless person, about to threaten me into buying a copy of The Big Issue. What's that? You're a computer journalist? Haha... Now I wish you were a homeless person. Haha, no, not really. What's that? You want to ask me some questions? Well, let me see, I'm not sure that I have the time, but, well, alright then I suppose you could... Trains? Yes, I'm really very fond of trains. Many's the time I've stood on a platform at six in the morning, eating my tuna sandwiches and drinking my weak lemon drink, hoping for a glimpse of a dusty old locomotive. I was usually disappointed, of course, because all the trains were electric by then, and somehow an Intercity 115 just wasn't as romantic as a steam engine. What's that? Spectrums? Yes, I remember those... I always preferred the Amstrad CPC myself... It had a lovely keyboard, as I recall... Wait! Come back! I haven't finished telling you about the wonderfully colourful graphics!
