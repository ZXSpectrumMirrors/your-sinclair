YS3 Makes It To The World of Spectrum
</B>
<BR><BR>

At last <B>YS3</B> has made it to the links page of Martijn van der Heide's lovely, lovely World. What did Martijn, the man who archives all things Spectrum, have to say about us?
<BR><BR>
<B>'YS3, by Jon Hyde, Jamie Percival and Nathan Cross.</B> <BR>
The legend of Your Sinclair continues today! '
<BR><BR>
Hurrah! Recognition at last! (And far more enthusiatic than the FAQ, although we probably shouldn't mention that bit. Damn.) Martijn, you're welcome to join us in the <B>YS3</B> office for a Toffee Cream Slice any time. (Except Saturdays, or Sundays after three o'clock. Or whenever we're out. But you get the idea.)
