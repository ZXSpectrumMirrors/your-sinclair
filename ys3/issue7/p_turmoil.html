Chaos is without doubt one of the best multiplayer strategy games ever.
Games such as <i>Command and Conquer</i> pale beside <b>Julian Gollop</b>'s classic
masterpiece. Luckily for us, <b>Dan Condon-Jones</b> agrees with us. And,
luckier still, Mr Condon-Jones is a rather good programmer.
<br><br>
Currently being developed for Windows, <b>Turmoil - The Battle of Wizards</b>
is a remake of that venerable classic that brings all of the tension and
drama of those rubber-keyed days to the PC. At the time of writing much
of the main game engine looks to be in place, along with a lot of very
flashy special effects. It plays very similarly to the original, albeit
slightly easier to control thanks to the mouse interface - no more
trying to remember what the keys are!
<br><br>
As you can see from the screenshots, it looks amazing, and it looks like
it'll have the gameplay to match. Check out Dan's site for more details.
