<b>Top 101 Things To Do While Waiting For Your Speccy To Load</b><br><br>
As the colder, darker days of winter close in around us like some dark fog of despair, <i>YS3</i> brings you some more… eh? Oh. It's sunny outside. And what a beautifully clear blue sky with only hints of cotton-white fluffy clouds. You can hear the birds singing, too! Er. Hmmm. Well, in that case let's give you some things to think about <b>not only</b> whilst your Speccy is loading, <b>but also</b> when you're walking to the shops on account of the remarkably clement weather to by some traditional lemonade. Don't say we don't look after you, and if you can solve all ten of these philosophical conundrums which have been baffling humanity for centuries, we'll send you a real Speccy game for being so clever. Or you can just use them to achieve a state of nirvana with the great Llama. (<i>All hail the great Llama! Ed</i>)
<ol start=60>
<li>If a tree falls in the forest, and there is no-one around to hear it… does it still make a sound?</li>
<li>Why does your mum always (and I mean without fail) walk in on the worst part of the movie or TV show that you're watching, the thirty-second bit of nastiness in the whole three-hour event? Why not at some point in the other one hundred and seventy-nine minutes and thirty seconds?</li>
<li>Can God make a stone too heavy for Him to be able to lift?</li>
<li>Cats always land feet-first and toast always lands butter-side down. So if you strap a piece of toast to a cat, butter-side pointing away from its feet, and drop it… which way will it land?</li>
<li>This statement is a lie. (Think about it…)</li>
<li>Should we seek to make people happy or to fulfil their desires…</li>
<li>… or is there an alternative and preferable course of action?</li>
<li>Why is it that, despite many hundred hits each month, <i>YS3</i> only ever gets about ten e-mails (and nine-and-a-half of those are junk mail from Littlewoods)?</li>
<li>What is the sound of one hand clapping?</li>
<li>Why do women never go to the bathroom alone?</li>
