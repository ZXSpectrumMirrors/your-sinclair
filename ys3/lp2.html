<br>
<p id="normtxt">EXT. THE CITY - DOWNTOWN - MID-DAY</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">The city streets are bustling with traffic. It is a little after mid-day, and the noon sun beats down on pedestrians and vehicles alike as we PAN ACROSS the city. A park near the city's centre offers one of the few respites of green in the urban sprawl. Children are playing, their shouts and laughter carrying over the honking and engine noise to one of the many cars that are slowly moving nearby. Inside this particular car are a man and a penguin. </p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">INT. CAR - JON AND BOB</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">JON is in the driving seat, looking depressed. He sighs.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> Look at this traffic. It's days like this I wish this car had stripes down the side.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> It's days like this I wish we had a helicopter.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> At this rate it's going to take us another hour to get to the station.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> Why don't you just switch the siren on?</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> Because we'd have to fill in a form to explain why we used it.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> Yeah, so?</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> 'Because I couldn't stand sitting in a blimmin' traffic jam for another two hours' is not generally regarded as a good excuse. Oh, wait here we go...</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> It's about time...</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">JON edges the car forwards as the line of traffic begins to shuffle along the road, only to be forced to stop just in front of a stop light. JON sighs again.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> Tch.</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">A horn honks behind them, and the sound of a roaring engine and squealing tyres give the two men (well, man and penguin) mere moments of warning before a black four-door saloon tears past them, mounting the pavement to avoid the traffic ahead as terrified pedestrians dive out of its path. JON turns to BOB.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> You know what this means, don't you?</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB AND JON (SIMULTANEOUSLY)</p><p id="speechtxt"> CAR CHASE!</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">BOB grabs the light from its resting place on the dashboard and leans out of his window to stick it onto the roof. JON slams his foot onto the accelerator, and after a second's wheelspin lifts a cloud of smoke onto the bonnet of the car behind, the siren begins to wail and the unmarked police car leaps into pursuit of the first car, forcing the pedestrians out of the way for a second time.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> Woohoo!</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">The saloon swerves left, back onto the road, forcing cars to brake suddenly. The police car follows, fractionally slower, knocking over an old woman's shopping cart and narrowly missing the owner.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON (SHOUTING)</p><p id="speechtxt"> Sorry!</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> You just missed a ten pointer there, Jon!</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">As the cars ahead begin to draw to a halt at an intersection, the runaway car swerves across the road to face the stationary oncoming traffic across the junction, crossing back again as it reaches the other side. The police car behind is a few seconds behind, and as it reaches the intersection vehicles are slowly beginning to move across its path.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> Uh oh...</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> Go for it, man, go for it!</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">JON closes his eyes and floors the accelerator. The other cars lurch and stop as the police car careens out in front of them, siren wailing, and continues after the first car. JON opens his eyes.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> Wow. That was unexpected.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> They're headed for the freeway.</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">The fleeing car slaloms through traffic for a few seconds longer, drawing inexorably closer to the high-speed road out of the city. JON and BOB continue their dogged pursuit, even as the cars uninvolved in the chase are forced to halt and crash around them. Both cars mount the onramp.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> It's no good, we're not going to catch them, depite my total disregard for public safety.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> Gimme your gun.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> Er...</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> I have a plan of such genius that Einstein would pat me congratulatorily on the back, if he weren't dead.</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">JON takes his revolver from under his jacket and hands it to his partner. BOB opens the sunroof and climbs out onto the roof of the car before drawing his own semi-automatic pistol. The fleeing car dodges around the last few remaining vehicles before accelerating with a squeal of melting rubber away from the city. The traffic begins to form a wall behind it, blocking the pursuing car's path.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB (SHOUTING)</p><p id="speechtxt"> Don't slow down!</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> But we'll hit the cars!</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> I know!</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">JON fastens his seatbelt and presses himself as far back in his seat as</p>
<p id="normtxt">he can, slamming down the accelerator to push the car closer to its top</p>
<p id="normtxt">speed.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> On the bright side, if I don't survive I won't have to explain this to Captain O'Hara.</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">The police car crashes into the back of the queue of traffic. The front of the car, like the back of the car it hits, crumples like paper. The airbag in JON's steering wheel explodes, catching his head as he is thrown forward. BOB, meanwhile, has nothing to stop him as he is thrown forward. Extending his wings and sticking his beak in front of him, he glides over the traffic and along the freeway. As 'Flight of the Valkyries' begins to play, he begins to approach his still-fleeing target. Swooping down, he makes a near-perfect landing on the car's roof. Spinning a pistol in each hand, he grins evilly.</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">CUT TO inside of speeding car.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> DRIVER</p><p id="speechtxt"> What was that?</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> PASSENGER</p><p id="speechtxt"> It's probably nothing.</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">BOB begins firing both pistols into the roof of the car. Bullets rain down onto the occupants, killing the driver and seriously wounding the passenger. The driver slumps forward onto the steering wheel, and the car begins to swerve wildly.</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">CUT TO BOB.</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">BOB backflips off the roof of the car, landing heavily on the concrete freeway. The car swerves a few more times before hitting a crash barrier and stopping. Heavy footsteps from behind cause BOB to turn around as JON half-jogs, half-limps towards him. JON bends over, trying to recover his breath, and surveys the situation. The passenger door of the car falls open and then off as the injured passenger attempts to crawl away from the crash.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> Hey, you didn't blow the car up, and you left a bad guy alive.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> Oh, sorry.</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">BOB raises his semi-automatic pistol. The passenger puts up one hand. JON lunges towards BOB,</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> NOOO..!</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">BOB fires at the wrecked car. The single bullet hits the fuel tank, and the car is flipped into the air by an almighty explosion. As the flames fill the screen, the title music starts and the credits roll.</p>

<br>
<p id="normtxt">INT. POLICE HQ - OPEN PLAN OFFICE</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">The Miscellaneous Crimes Department at the city's police headquarters is bustling with people, as ever. Dozens of police officers and civilian support staff mill around, many making the effort to look busy by carrying files and clipboards around, most not bothering to hide their laziness and carrying around cups of coffee. JON and BOB enter the open-plan office. JON is still moving stiffly, and a row of stitches above his right eye marks the entrance and removal of a piece of windshield. The two detectives head for their desks.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> COP</p><p id="speechtxt"> Well look who it is! Can you boys get me some cheap flights to Miami?</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> Ahaha. How amusing.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> COP</p><p id="speechtxt"> You'll want to watch out for the captain. He's really gunning for you two.</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">The door to a small office across the room opens up, and CAPTAIN O'HARA emerges.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> O'HARA</p><p id="speechtxt"> Murtaugh! Riggs! Get your worthless, no-good hides in here!</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">BOB opens a drawer in his desk and pulls out a set of badly-burned animal skins.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> O'HARA</p><p id="speechtxt"> And I don't mean the unsold produce from your moonlighting exploits!</p>
<br>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">INT. O'HARA'S OFFICE</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">O'HARA walks behind his desk and sits in his chair. BOB and JON enter the office, JON closing the door behind him. They stand before their commanding officer, awaiting the inevitable. They do not have to wait long.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> O'HARA</p><p id="speechtxt"> What in god's name happened out there?</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> Well, quite a lot of good charitable work, but also an unfortunate number of misguided acts of violence. We prefer to focus on the constructive aspects of religion, rather than the misappropriation of religious symbolism for the furthering of unworthy causes.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> Busted a speeder.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> O'HARA</p><p id="speechtxt"> No you didn't. 'Busted a speeder' implies that you arrested a motorist who was breaking the speed limit. What you two did was chase him halfway across the city, cause a pile-up on the freeway, execute the motorist, then blow up the already-disabled vehicle and the one remaining suspect.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> It was a simple misunderstanding. See, Jon said...</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> Hey, you're the one who fired the gun...</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> O'HARA</p><p id="speechtxt"> Remind me again what actual police procedure is. You may recall police procedure from your days in training, if either of you spent any time in police training, which, given the evidence presented to me, seems increasingly unlikely.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> Er... Should we have shot the tyres out?</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> Ooh! Ooh! I know! We're supposed to give them a ticket, right?</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">O'HARA slumps forward and puts his head in his hands. He sighs a deep, sad sigh before sitting back up and facing his subordinates. When he speaks again, his voice is quiet, threatening.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> O'HARA</p><p id="speechtxt"> I am going to give you two clowns one last chance. There's been a drive-by shooting downtown. You two are going to check it out, and find out who did it, and arrest them. You are not going to kill anyone. If you do kill anyone...</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">BOB opens his mouth to speak, but O'HARA continues talking, glaring at the penguin.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> O'HARA</p><p id="speechtxt"> ...Or seriously injure anyone, you will be busted down faster than you can guess the bad guy in an episode of Scooby Doo. Do I make myself clear?</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> Well...</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">JON grabs BOB's arm and begins pulling him towards the door.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> Yes. Yes, sir. Absolutely clear. We'll be going now. Come on, Bob, we've got work to do.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p id="normtxt"> EXT. THE CITY - DOWNTOWN - AFTERNOON</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">Mid-afternoon in the city. We see a deprived inner-city area. Surrounded by large apartment blocks and even larger towers is a set of basketball courts. One of these courts is covered with white sheets, each one covering a body. An ice-cream van is standing nearby, riddled with bulletholes. Uniformed police officers are swarming all over the scene, stringing blue tape around the crime scene. A photographer is taking pictures of the ice-cream van from every possible angle. Another, unmarked, car stops alongside the numerous parked patrol cars. BOB and JON emerge from within and approach the most important-looking police officer.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> What happened here, officer?</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> OFFICER</p><p id="speechtxt"> Drive-by shooting. Bunch of kids playing basketball got wasted. Looks like a gang hit, but this ice-cream van was caught in the crossfire. Driver's dead.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> Gang hit, huh? Any survivors? Witnesses?</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> OFFICER</p><p id="speechtxt"> Yeah, we've got a couple of the kids over there. You wanna talk to 'em?</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> Not really, no.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> But since that's our job, we'd better do it anyway.</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">The police officer leads the two detectives to the two young basketball players.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> I'm Detective Sergeant Murtaugh, and this is Detective Sergeant Riggs. Could you tell us what happened here?</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> KID #1</p><p id="speechtxt"> Like we told the other cops, it was a drive-by.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> Could you tell us anything we couldn't work out from logical deduction?</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> KID #2</p><p id="speechtxt"> We was just playing some ball. That ice-cream van there stopped nearby, so we dropped out to buy some refreshments, y'know? We was just handing over some green when outta nowhere this other ice-cream van appears and starts spraying bullets everywhere.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> KID #1</p><p id="speechtxt"> We ducked down behind the van, so we didn't get hit.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> KID #2</p><p id="speechtxt"> Damn, I never want to hear 'Pop Goes The Weasel' again.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> Thanks for your time. We'll take care of things from here on in.</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">BOB and JON head back to their car.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> So what now? Shall we just say these two did it and save on the paperwork?</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> Tempting, but we're not a quarter into the film yet. I think we'd better talk to the company that owns this van.</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">BOB shrugs.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> Okay. I've nothing better to do this afternoon anyway. What's the company called?</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> (Glances at van) Smalltown Ice Company.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">INT. SMALLTOWN ICE COMPANY</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">The Smalltown Ice Co works out of a fairly small, one-storey building that from the outside looks like a simple ice-cream parlour. BOB and JON stop their car outside and enter the building. A few people are sitting at the counter, eating ice-cream. A couple of tables sit empty at the windows. Behind the counter is a young woman dressed in a pastel pink uniform.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> Good afternoon...</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> SALLY</p><p id="speechtxt"> Hi, I'm Sally! How can I help you?</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> (Smirking) By taking off your...</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">JON grabs BOB's beak.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> He's Detective Sergeant Riggs, and I'm Detective Sergeant Murtaugh. I'm afraid there's been a bit of an accident with one of your vans.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> (Struggling free) Less of an accident, more of a drive-by shooting.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> SALLY</p><p id="speechtxt"> Oh my goodness! Who was driving?</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> Just a nameless extra, no one to worry about. Could we talk to whoever's in charge?</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> SALLY</p><p id="speechtxt"> Of course. You'll want to talk to my grandfather. Come with me, I'll take you to him.</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">SALLY leads the two detectives through a back door, deeper into the building. They pass through a small factory set-up, where a small group of men and women perform miscellaneous tasks with frozen dairy produce, to an office with a window onto the factory floor. Inside is an old man. At first he looks quite sad, but smiles when he sees SALLY.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> MR TIMSON</p><p id="speechtxt"> Hello, Sally! What is it?</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> SALLY</p><p id="speechtxt"> Grandfather, these two police officers are here to talk to you. They say something bad's happened.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> MR TIMSON</p><p id="speechtxt"> Well, come in, gentlemen.</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">BOB and JON enter the office. SALLY leaves, returning to her job.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> MR TIMSON</p><p id="speechtxt"> Why don't you sit down?</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> Because we're being filmed in Supermarionation. I can dangle a couple of inches above the chair if you like?</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> F.A.B.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> MR TIMSON</p><p id="speechtxt"> So what's happened?</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> Drive-by shooting. One of your vans got hit pretty bad. The driver's dead.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> MR TIMSON</p><p id="speechtxt"> Oh my god, no.</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">MR TIMSON collapses into his chair.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> MR TIMSON</p><p id="speechtxt"> My son, George. I thought he was just running late, even if it was by more than three hours.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> (in a whiny voice) "Just a nameless extra, no one to worry about."</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> (To BOB) Well how was I to know?</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> MR TIMSON</p><p id="speechtxt"> Who could possibly have done this?</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> Er, we were hoping you could tell us. The vehicle used to perform the shooting was another ice-cream van.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> Playing 'Pop Goes The Weasel.'</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> MR TIMSON</p><p id="speechtxt"> 'Pop Goes The Weasel'? But there's only one company in town that plays that tune...</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">MR TIMSON dramatically spins his chair away from the detectives, a look of fear etched on his face.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> MR TIMSON</p><p id="speechtxt"> ...Whimsey's Frozen Dairy Products.</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">JON and BOB look at each other.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> You know, I'm beginning to doubt the premise behind this case.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> Why would anyone want to kill your son?</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">MR TIMSON spins his chair back around to face his questioner.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> MR TIMSON</p><p id="speechtxt"> It all started back in 1972. It was a long, hot summer that year, and the people wanted something to cool them down. They wanted ice cream. Jake Whimsey and I were friends from high school, and we decided that we could make a few bucks selling ice-cream. We made our own, to save on costs, and pooled our money to buy a used ice-cart to sell it from. Well, before you knew it...</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> So, you used to be friends but now you hate each other and are engaged in a bitter territorial feud over the sale of frozen dairy products?</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> MR TIMSON</p><p id="speechtxt"> Well, yeah. But my story would've sounded better.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> I rather doubt it. (Turns to JON) Whimsey's?</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> Why not, eh?</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">EXT. WHIMSEY'S FROZEN DAIRY PRODUCTS</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">Whimsey's is a huge complex surrounded by a two-metre high concrete wall, topped with barbed wire. Inside, the tops of warehouse-like buildings are visible. At the front of the complex is the only apparent entrance - a tall steel gate, wide enough to allow vehicles to enter when open. At the moment, the gate is firmly closed. BOB and JON's car draws up to it, stopping alongside an intercom device. JON winds his windows down and presses the only button on the intercom. It buzzes for a moment, then a barely audible voice responds.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> VOICE</p><p id="speechtxt"> Who is it?</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> I'm Detective Sergeant Murtaugh. I'd like to speak to Mr Whimsey, please.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> VOICE</p><p id="speechtxt"> One moment please.</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">There is a pause. JON and BOB wait for the gate to open.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> Any plans for how we're going to question him?</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> Anything beyond 'Did your goons kill George Timson?' you mean?</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> Yes.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> No.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> Ah.</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">There is another pause.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> We could try good cop/bad cop.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> After last time? It would have worked if we'd decided beforehand who was going to be the good cop. Bad cop/bad cop just doesn't work.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> He answered all our questions.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> When he recovered the ability to speak, yes.</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">The intercom buzzes again.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> VOICE</p><p id="speechtxt"> You still there?</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> Yes.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> VOICE</p><p id="speechtxt"> You got a warrant?</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> No.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> VOICE</p><p id="speechtxt"> Then get lost.</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">The intercom goes dead. JON turns to BOB.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> I suppose we could go and get a warrant.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> But we only want to talk to him, not search the place.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> A fair point. We don't need a warrant to talk to him. (Thinks for a moment.) Do we?</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> I don't think so, no.</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">JON and BOB get out of the car and head for the trunk. Opening it up, BOB takes out a hefty metal-cutting device. He closes the trunk and approaches the gate.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> You know, I think this could count as criminal damage.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> (Pointing behind JON) Look! Philippa Forrester!</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> (Turns) Where?</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">With two swift snips BOB cuts a bar in the gate loose. It clatters to the floor. JON turns back again.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> Oh look. Their gate appears to be broken. We should probably go inside and check there are no intruders.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">There is little activity inside the compound. A few dozen ice-cream vans stand idle in an impromptu parking lot, but there are no people walking around. A lot of noise is coming from the factory. The detectives approach, quickly finding a door. They enter.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">INT. WHIMSEY'S GENERIC FACTORY</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">Inside, the factory contains all the generic equipment to be expected in such a place. Various people are working with unidentifiable machines, presumably producing ice-cream. Beside the door is a guard hut, inside of which is a guard. He emerges at once and confronts the police officers.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> GUARD</p><p id="speechtxt"> Hey! Who the hell are you?</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> I'm Detective Sergeant Murtaugh, and this is Detective Sergeant Riggs. We're here to see Mr Whimsey.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> GUARD</p><p id="speechtxt"> Didn't I just tell you guys to get lost?</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> We are. Perhaps you could give us directions to Mr Whimsey's office?</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> GUARD</p><p id="speechtxt"> Now you get out of here right now or...</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> Can you remember what the procedure is for dealing with someone impeding an investigation?</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> Well, usually we get into a heated discussion as to the pros and cons of either beating them senseless or working out some clever way to remove them from the situation.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> Then what?</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> Generally we come to a compromise, in which our impediment is either beaten senseless or handcuffed to a moving vehicle. However, it seems to me that there is a faster method of reaching a decision, by way of using the same method we use for all complex dilemmas.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> Of course!</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">BOB and JON each extend their right arm, fists clenched. They shake their fists once, twice, three times, finally opening their fists to reveal that while JON has chosen paper, BOB has chosen scissors.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> You win.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> A senseless beating it is, then. (BOB takes a step toward the guard.)</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> GUARD</p><p id="speechtxt"> (Holding up his hands) Okay, okay! I'll take you to see the boss. But he's not gonna be happy...</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">INT. WHIMSEY'S OFFICE</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">JAKE WHIMSEY has the kind of office you'd expect from a high-flying corporate CEO. Tropical fish tank, expensive office furniture, non-descript art and sculptures... Just the sort of thing you probably wouldn't expect in the office of a high-ranking ice-cream vendor. (Or maybe you would. I don't know.)</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">There is a knock at the door. Without waiting for a response, the door is opened. JON pokes his head around it to survey the room. JAKE looks up from the document he is reading.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JAKE</p><p id="speechtxt"> Yes?</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">JON enters. BOB follows, closing the door behind him.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> He's Detective Sergeant Riggs, I'm Detective Sergeant Murtaugh. We'd like to talk to you about a murder.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JAKE</p><p id="speechtxt"> Do you have a warrant?</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> Technically... (JON looks at BOB for assurance) ...we don't need a warrant to talk to you.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JAKE</p><p id="speechtxt"> Are you arresting me?</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> Not as such, no.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JAKE</p><p id="speechtxt"> Then I don't have to talk to you, and you're trespassing. I could demand that you get off my property. (JAKE thinks for a moment, then grins.) But I'm a good citizen, always happy to aid the police in their investigations. Why don't you sit down?</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> These trousers are rather heavily starched.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JAKE</p><p id="speechtxt"> So, what do you want to talk to me about?</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> A murder. Weren't you listening?</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> Earlier today, an ice-cream vendor from your rival, Smalltown Ices, was gunned down in the street.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> Well, in his van. But that was in the street.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> According to eye-witnesses...</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> Y'know, I've always wondered about that. You never hear about 'ear-witnesses' or 'nose-witnesses'...</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> Hush. According to witnesses, the occupants of another ice-cream van were responsible for the shooting. A little digging revealed that the ice-cream van must belong to you.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JAKE</p><p id="speechtxt"> And why is that?</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> Only your vans play 'Pop Goes The Weasel'.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JAKE</p><p id="speechtxt"> Our vans are equipped with industry-standard child-attractor devices. We get lots of tunes, we don't specify which ones we do or don't play. Why, just last week we got a dozen 'Old MacDonald's.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> But no other vans play 'Pop Goes The Weasel'.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JAKE</p><p id="speechtxt"> None? Anywhere? You think Joe Schmoe couldn't go out, buy a van and install a 'Weasel' onboard? You know what, this stinks of a set-up. A couple of lazy cops who couldn't be bothered to do their jobs properly decide to pin it all on the first ice-cream vendor they come across. (Jake stands up.) Well that dog don't hunt, mister! I'm an honest citizen, and a major contributor to the mayor's election campaign! I'll see to it that you boys are out of a job before the day is out!</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">JAKE picks up his phone and begins dialling.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JAKE</p><p id="speechtxt"> Is that the mayor's office? This is Jake Whimsey. I want to speak to him right now. Yes, it's important. What do you mean, he's not in? It's barely three o'clock! He's playing golf? And he didn't invite me? Damn it!</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">JAKE hangs up.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JAKE</p><p id="speechtxt"> The mayor's out. I'll get you fired later. Now get out of my office!</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">EXT. WHIMSEY'S FACTORY COMPOUND</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">BOB and JON are leaving the factory and crossing the compound, heading back for the main gate.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> That went well.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> Apart from the 'aggravating someone who's friends with our boss' part, yeah.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> Perhaps he was bluffing.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> We should have done good cop/bad cop.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> I've told you, it went horribly wrong last time. We're not doing that again.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> Well, what do we do now?</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> I don't know. We're out of leads.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> I guess we should try using everything we're carrying on random pieces of scenery.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> Let's head back to the station and see if anyone got a licence plate number for that van.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> Right-oh.</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">The detectives step through the hole in the gate and approach their car.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">INT. POLICE HQ - MISCELLANEOUS CRIMES DEPT.</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">JON and BOB enter the bustling office.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> Typical. A whole bunch of witnesses and nobody bothered to write down the licence number.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> It's especially annoying since it would've given the captain a reason not to fire us.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> I'm not getting fired this week. I've got one hell of a phone bill to pay, so one way or another we're going to crack this case.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> So it's time for a bit of the old ultraviolence, then?</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> No! We're under orders, remember? One maiming and it's all over. We're going to have to do this properly.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> Erm... Can you remember what exactly 'doing it properly' entails?</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> Um... I think it involves finding the good-hearted but foolishly-misguided girl that always attaches herself to a serious bad guy like this one.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> But where do we start looking?</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> How about at your desk?</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">Sitting at BOB's desk is an understatedly-dressed yet still astonishingly attractive young woman.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> It's a plan, I suppose.</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">The detectives approach the woman.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> Hi there. I'm Detective Sergeant Riggs. How can I help you?</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> WOMAN</p><p id="speechtxt"> One of the officers said you were the person I needed to talk to. It's about the shooting earlier today.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> The ice-cream drive-by?</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">The woman nods.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> WOMAN</p><p id="speechtxt"> My name's Jessica. I work for Jake Whimsey, at Whimsey's Frozen Dairy Products. I'm his secretary. I heard you talking to him earlier. I just wasn't sure whether... I...</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> This isn't exactly a comfortable environment, is it? Why don't we go talk somewhere else? In fact... (glances at watch) ...why don't we talk over dinner? I know this great Italian place not far from here.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JESSICA</p><p id="speechtxt"> That sounds great.</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">BOB and JESSICA leave.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> Hi! I'm Detective Sergeant Murtaugh, and I'm responsible for filling in the paperwork. Apparently. (Sits down and begins typing.)</p>

<br>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">INT. PIZZA HUT, ONLY WITH THE SIGNS OBSCURED DUE TO 'NEGOTIATION DIFFICULTIES'.</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">The restaurant is almost full. BOB and JESSICA sit opposite each other at a window table, a hot Hawaiian pizza sitting in neat slices on a plate before them. BOB is consuming slices with the aim of eating more pizza than JESSICA. JESSICA is still on her first slice, while BOB is on his third, judging by the uneaten crusts before him.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> What's wrong? Don't you like it?</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JESSICA</p><p id="speechtxt"> I'm not that hungry.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> Things on your mind, hm?</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">JESSICA nods.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JESSICA</p><p id="speechtxt"> It's this whole murder business. I'm sure you're aware by now that this isn't the first incident.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> It isn't?</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JESSICA</p><p id="speechtxt"> There's been bad blood between Whimsey's and Smalltown Ices for as long as I've worked for Mr Whimsey.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> Really? How bad?</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JESSICA</p><p id="speechtxt"> Well, as I said, this isn't the first incident. There's been a lot of violence before; beatings, sabotage... This is the first time I've heard of someone being killed, though. But... (sniffs)</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> But what?</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JESSICA</p><p id="speechtxt"> It won't be the last. (Tears begin trickling down her face.) I overheard Mr Whimsey on the phone after you'd left... He's planning to expand his operations, and that means getting Smalltown Ices out of the way. And he'll do whatever it takes.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> I see.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JESSICA</p><p id="speechtxt"> He's setting something big up for tomorrow afternoon, about three o'clock. I'm not sure what it is, but it's big.</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">There is a brief, but uncomfortable, silence. Only one slice of pizza remains.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> Are you going to eat that?</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">JESSICA finally smiles.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JESSICA</p><p id="speechtxt"> Knock yourself out.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> Will I get to eat the pizza then?</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">JESSICA pushes the plate towards BOB. BOB takes the remaining slice and begins eating.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> So where are you staying? I'll give you a lift home.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JESSICA</p><p id="speechtxt"> That's not necessary, really.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> No, I insist. The city's a dangerous place, I couldn't possibly let you go home by yourself.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JESSICA</p><p id="speechtxt"> It's not that dangerous...</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> It must be - I live here.</p>

<br>
<p id="normtxt">BOB enters, whistling. JON wakes up as BOB sits down, and glances at his watch.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> What time do you call this?</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> I call it... 'Enderigati'. Why?</p>

<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> It's half nine in the morning.</p>

<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> For one, you're usually in later than this. For two, you took the car last night and didn't come back.</p>

<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> So?</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> You know full well I live half-an-hour's drive outside of the city. I had to sleep at my desk.</p>

<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> Well... think of the good impression it'll leave on the captain.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> Hmph... So did the lovely Jessica tell you anything? And more importantly, did she tell you anything relevant to the case?</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> As a matter of fact...</p>

<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> Great! Can we go?</p>

<p id="chartxt"> O'HARA</p><p id="speechtxt"> I give you one simple little case, and you bozos somehow manage to screw it up.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> To be fair, sir, it wasn't as simple a case as it appeared on the surface...</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> O'HARA</p><p id="speechtxt"> A drive-by! That's all it was! One little drive-by shooting! A meter maid could have cracked it by now, but not you guys. Oh no.

<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> Well...</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> O'HARA</p><p id="speechtxt"> I don't want to hear it! You two are off the case! Period! Now get out of my office while I try to find somebody stupid enough to let me transfer you to their department!</p>

<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> How those 'musicians' on the Gap ads are obviously miming?</p>

<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> Fair point.</p>

<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> Why did you become a police officer, Bob?</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> I wanted to carry a gun and beat people up because they looked suspicious. You?</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> I joined to serve the public trust, protect the innocent, and uphold the law. And something else that escapes me for the moment. But the point is, we're police officers. We have to uphold the law. And the law says no killing, unless we do it on behalf of the state and remember to fill in the relevant forms.</p>

<p id="normtxt">At that moment, the sound of 'Pop Goes The Weasel' fills the air. JON and BOB turn to see a convoy of three ice-cream vans drives slowly down the street. As they pass the ice-cream parlour, men with machine guns appear at the serving hatches and spray the building with bullets. The windows shatter and cement dust begins to obscure their view. After a good fifteen seconds of continuous fire, the ice-cream vans drive off.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> Ahem.</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">JON and BOB get into their car and begin to pursue the ice-cream vans.</p>

<br>
<p id="normtxt">INT. THE CAR</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">The tyres squeal as JON stamps on the accelerator, pulling the car away from the kerb. BOB picks up the police radio and switches on.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> This is Riggs! We're in pursuit of three ice-cream vans, they just shot up Smalltown Ice Company!</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">A distracted-sounding radio controller replies.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> RADIO</p><p id="speechtxt"> Uh, say again?</p>

<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> Three ice-cream vans, headed down Ninth!</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> RADIO</p><p id="speechtxt"> And they just shot up an ice-cream company?</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> Yes!</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> RADIO</p><p id="speechtxt"> You nearly got me there, Bob. Now cut it out, we got serious work to do here.</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">BOB puts the radio down.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> Looks like we're on our own.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> Tch.</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">The police car draws closer to the rear-most ice-cream van in the convoy. BOB draws his pistol.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> Bring us alongside.</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">JON edges the car closer to the van, accelerating further and pulling the bonnet in line with the van's serving hatch. BOB climbs out of his window and onto the bonnet of the car. A shocked face emerges from the passenger window of the van, then ducks back inside.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> (Shouting) We're not supposed to kill anyone!</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">BOB mutters something under his breath and jumps through the still-open serving hatch. The man responsible for the shocked face emerges from his window again and points a pistol at JON.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> Gaah!</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">JON stamps on the brakes. His car screams to a halt, and the ice-cream van tears away.</p>

<p id="normtxt">BOB crouches behind a stack of Flake boxes, pistol in hand, pondering his next action.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> (Whispering to himself) I could kill 'em... I really should kill 'em...</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">BOB begins to stand up, but then changes his mind.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> No, no. The captain said not to kill anyone. And it's about time I proved I've got what it takes to be a police officer. I'll wait it out. Yeah, that's a plan. I'll wait it out.</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">After a minute or so, the van stops. BOB hears the doors open, the other occupants get out, and slam the doors shut. BOB sighs with relief and puts his gun away. The rear doors then open. Two large men are standing outside. They look at BOB. BOB looks at them and grins.</p>

<br>
<p id="normtxt">JON draws up in his car, an anxious look on his face. He gets out and slowly ascends the steps towards the building. Before he can get halfway, a booming voice halts him in his tracks.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> O'HARA</p><p id="speechtxt"> Murtaugh! What the hell are you doing back here?</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> Uh, there's a problem, sir.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> O'HARA</p><p id="speechtxt"> No kidding! You and Riggs have been transferred out of so many departments that there's no-one left I can dump you on! Now there's a problem!</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> It's about the ice-cream case. An informant tipped Bob off about a shooting at Smalltown Ice Company. We got there just in time to see it happen.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> O'HARA</p><p id="speechtxt"> So where's Riggs now?</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> He jumped into the back of one of their vans, then I lost 'em. I've got my suspicions about where he is, but...</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> O'HARA</p><p id="speechtxt"> What the hell's that noise?</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">The sound of 'Pop Goes The Weasel' drifts along the street. JON turns to see an ice-cream van approaching the police station. He stands between the van and the captain and draws his revolver. The van draws nearer, pausing at the bottom of the steps. The rear doors burst open, and a black and white bundle is thrown out. The ice-cream van speeds away.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> Oh no...</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">JON and O'HARA rush down the steps to the bundle. It is an unconscious BOB. He has been severely beaten. His pistol remains holstered and unfired.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> Call an ambulance!</p>

<p id="normtxt">BOB is lying in bed, swathed in bandages, with needles and wires attached to various parts of his body. An expensive-looking machine stands nearby, emitting a steady beeping tone. JON sits in a chair beside the bed.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> I shouldn't have let you jump into that van. You always do the really dangerous stuff, and I always end up stuck in the car. (Sighs.) I didn't mean what I said about you being incompetent, you know. You're self-serving, ambitionless, and a slob, but you're not incompetent. I'm sorry, Bob.</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">BOB coughs. His eyes slowly open.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> Jon..?</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> Right here, buddy.</p>

<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> I didn't kill anyone.</p>

<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> I.. (Coughs.) I found out where those vans went.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> Where was it?</p>

<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> They went back to their boss, Mr Timson.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> Of course! The man we least suspected!</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> Not really. They went back to Whimsey's, like we thought all along.</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">The door opens, and Captain O'HARA walks in carrying a large bunch of flowers.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> O'HARA</p><p id="speechtxt"> Riggs? You awake?</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">BOB coughs again.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> Yes, sir.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> O'HARA</p><p id="speechtxt"> Good. How you feelin'?</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> Not bad, sir.</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">O'HARA pulls up another chair and sits down, placing the flowers on the end of BOB's bed.</p>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> Bob found out where the vans went. It was Whimsey all along.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> O'HARA</p><p id="speechtxt"> Just like you said...</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">O'HARA holds his head in his hands.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> O'HARA</p><p id="speechtxt"> Oh, what have I done? If I hadn't ordered you not to hurt anyone, none of this would've happened... Well, I suppose it's probably not much help now, but I'm taking that order back. If you guys want to injure, torture, maim or kill a suspect in the course of your investigations, that's fine by me. Just make sure you fill out the paperwork, and I'll get it by. Oh, god, I'm so sorry...</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">O'HARA begins to sob, and gets up to leave.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> O'HARA</p><p id="speechtxt"> Murtaugh, I'd like a word with you outside.</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">O'HARA leaves.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> (To Bob) I'll just be a minute, okay?</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> No rush.</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">JON follows the captain.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> O'HARA</p><p id="speechtxt"> I take it you want to take care of whoever did this to Riggs?</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> Natch.</p>

<p id="chartxt"> O'HARA</p><p id="speechtxt"> Well, I'm behind you one hundred percent, no matter how many people you have to assault. You go do whatever it is you gotta do.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> Thanks, captain.</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">O'HARA walks off, wiping a tear from his eyes. JON looks thoughtful for a moment, and then re-enters BOB's room.</p>

<br>
<p id="normtxt">INT. EXPENSIVELY FURNISHED HOUSE - HALL</p>

<p id="normtxt">JAKE WHIMSEY arrives home. He closes the door behind him and throws his briefcase into one corner.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JAKE</p><p id="speechtxt"> Honey! I'm home!</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">JAKE looks into the lounge. It is empty, apart from the expensive furnishings. He walks to the end of the hall and into the kitchen. It, too, is empty, but JAKE is hungry. He walks across the room to his refrigerator and opens it to survey the contents. After careful consideration, he settles on a block of cheese and a packet of sliced ham. He turns to see JON in the opposite corner, sitting on the countertop. There is an audible click as JON pulls the hammer back on his revolver, which he has already aimed quite plainly at JAKE.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> You may remember me. I'm Detective Sergeant Murtaugh.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JAKE</p><p id="speechtxt"> Er... Yes. Is this about me getting you fired?</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> I've not been fired. In fact, I've been given carte blanche to commit whatever acts of violence it takes to find out who's behind this ice-cream war crap.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JAKE</p><p id="speechtxt"> Ah.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> So, either you tell me everything you know, or I do something quite, quite horrible to you.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JAKE</p><p id="speechtxt"> Ah.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> No, not 'ah'. 'I confess, I'm the criminal mastermind', sure. But not 'ah'.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JAKE</p><p id="speechtxt"> Look, I don't know how I can convince you. I'm not a criminal mastermind. I'm not even a criminal servantmind. I'm not even a slightly-naughty unemployed-masses-mind. I just sell ice-cream.</p>

<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> (Standing up) I guess we'll have to do this the hard way, then.</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">The front door opens. JON puts a finger to his lips, warning his prisoner to be silent. JAKE nods. Voices drift in from the hall.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> MAN</p><p id="speechtxt"> It went great. We shot the whole place up, there was damn near nothing left. It'll take 'em weeks to rebuild, let alone hire replacement staff.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> WOMAN</p><p id="speechtxt"> Oh, Jake, I really don't like all this violence. Does it have to be like this?</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">JAKE breaks his silence.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JAKE</p><p id="speechtxt"> (Whispers) My son...</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">JON glares at JAKE threateningly, and JAKE shuts up again. The voices slowly begin to get nearer.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JAKE JR</p><p id="speechtxt"> I suppose you'd like me to ask them nicely to shut up shop and get the hell out of town, huh? Well this is the real world, and in the real world bad things happen. I'm just making sure they happen to other people.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> WOMAN</p><p id="speechtxt"> But it seems so wrong...</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JAKE JR</p><p id="speechtxt"> Jessica, shut up. It's bad enough that I have to put up with my lily-livered dad, let alone you.</p>

<p id="chartxt"> JESSICA</p><p id="speechtxt"> I'm sorry, Jake.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JAKE JR</p><p id="speechtxt"> I shoulda just kept you as a secretary. Dad always said it was a bad idea to mix business and pleasure.</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">At that moment JAKE JR and JESSICA enter the kitchen. JAKE JR looks at JAKE, surprised.</p>

<p id="chartxt"> JAKE JR</p><p id="speechtxt"> Dad! I didn't know you were home.</p>

<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> Ahem.</p>

<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> I'm Detective Sergeant Murtaugh. You're nicked.</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">JAKE JR grabs JESSICA around the throat, draws a semi-automatic pistol from his jacket and holds it to his hostage's head.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JAKE JR</p><p id="speechtxt"> Drop the piece, copper, or the girl gets it.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> Oh, sure, that's a good plan. Drop my gun and then get shot. Real good plan.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JAKE JR</p><p id="speechtxt"> I mean it! Drop it or she's dead!</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">JAKE JR cocks the hammer on his pistol. JESSICA begins to cry.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> Oh, alright, I'll drop my gun.</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">JON throws his gun onto the kitchen counter beside him.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> Will you let the girl go now?</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JAKE JR</p><p id="speechtxt"> No. But I'll shoot you instead of her.</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">JAKE JR aims his pistol at JON. Before he can fire, though, JAKE SR hits him in the head with a kettle. JAKE JR falls to the floor. He looks accusingly at his father, and then runs off, down the hall and out of the house. JON is a second behind him, having recovered his own weapon.</p>

<p id="normtxt">JAKE JR runs towards his car parked in the street, diving over the bonnet to get to the driver's side. JON stops just outside the door and begins firing.

<p id="chartxt"> JAKE SR</p><p id="speechtxt"> I... I don't know...</p>

<p id="chartxt"> JESSICA</p><p id="speechtxt"> No! You can't! He's got a private army there. You wouldn't stand a chance on your own.</p>

<p id="normtxt">JON's car draws up outside the compound, away from the gates. He pops open the trunk, gets out and heads to the back of the car. As he begins to sort through the contents of the trunk, he hears a familiar voice.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> I can't believe you weren't going to call me for this.</p>

<p id="normtxt">JON turns around, surprised.</p>

<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> Well, I'm not entirely stupid, you know. I figured that sooner or later you'd end up here, and you know as well as I do that you can't take on an entire army by yourself. (Glances over JON's shoulder into the trunk.) Although it looks like you're going to have a bloody good go.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> You heard what the captain said, didn't you? 'If you guys want to injure, torture, maim or kill a suspect in the course of your investigations, that's fine by me.'</p>

<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> Time for a bit of the old ultraviolence?</p>

<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> Let's go to work.</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">CUT TO view of gates from inside compound. JON and BOB walk into view. They are both wearing long, black duster coats and sunglasses. BOB reaches under his coat and pulls out a steel cutter. He pulls the starter cord, and the toothed disc roars into life, spinning faster and faster. BOB draws the blade across the bars of the gate, first low, then high. One by one the bars fall to the floor of the compound. BOB throws away the steel cutter, and the detectives enter the compound.</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">Almost at once the factory doors slam open, and a swarm of goons emerge, all wielding clubs, baseball bats and heavy-looking bits of metal. They stand in a long line before the detectives, daring them to try to pass.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> LEAD GOON</p><p id="speechtxt"> So, you going to arrest us?</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">BOB and JON look at each other. They each sweep back their coats to reveal bandoliers carrying dozens of pistols and sub-machine guns. Drawing two pistols each, the detectives open fire on the goons, who begin to alternately run away screaming and fall over with gunshot wounds. The carnage continues for a full minute, with BOB picking off the slower runners with carefully-aimed shots. Finally, all is still, apart from a few of the injured trying to pull themselves away, moaning in pain. The detectives step over the bodies and head towards the factory.</p>

<p id="normtxt">JON and BOB throw away their pistols and place their hands behind their heads. The guard takes out some handcuffs and approaches BOB. BOB headbutts the guard, who falls backward. JON takes his pistol as he goes down, quickly removing the clip and throwing both items in opposite directions. BOB noisily kicks the guard into unconsciousness. The sound of lots of footsteps draws close. JON draws a couple of sub-machine guns from under his coat.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> JON</p><p id="speechtxt"> More goons coming in.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> BOB</p><p id="speechtxt"> Good-oh.</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">BOB pulls a shotgun from under his own coat. The two police officers run deeper into the factory, splitting up and fanning around the huge vats of ice-cream. Within moments the sound of gunfire fills the air, as properly-armed goons begin to pour onto the factory floor. JON and BOB slaughter their way through the building, pausing only to throw aside empty guns and draw fresh ones.</p>

There's a couple of psycho cops in my factory, and they're wiping out my employees. No, they're shooting them. With guns. Yes, they're killing them. No, they haven't read anyone their rights. Yes, I know! Could you get some real cops down here, please? Like, now?</p>
<br>
<p id="normtxt">The door bursts open. There is a lengthy burst of gunfire. JAKE JR peeks over the edge of his desk. The goons are dead. JON is standing in the doorway. He enters, followed by BOB.</p>

Police officers begin to fan out across the compound, pistols drawn in spite of the fact that everyone is obviously dead. The factory door opens, and JAKE JR emerges, hands cuffed behind his back, followed by JON and BOB. They hold up their badges to the other officers as they pass through the crowd. As they leave the compound, Captain O'HARA approaches them.</p>
<br>
<p id="chartxt"> O'HARA</p><p id="speechtxt"> So this is the bad guy, huh? Nice work fellas, we'll take it from here.</p>
