Football's never really been my thing. I used to play it a little at
school, for a while, in the playground, but pretty soon we were forced
to play it in the harshest of weather conditions, wearing shorts, and we
were expected to be competitive and want to beat the other team using
any means deemed necessary, despite the fact that the members of the
other team were up until the start of the match our friends. While these
expectations were met by most of the other players, who were quite happy
to perform Bruce Lee impersonations while tackling, there were those of
us who desired nothing more than to go home and do something vaguely
constructive. I can still remember one match in which no less than six
of us, members of opposing teams, decided to sit by one goalmouth and
commentate on the the tactics of the other players. Spectating, of
course, is something quite different. I've never had a problem sitting
in front of the TV and watching a footie match, provided it's halfway
interesting. International matches, for instance, at least until England
are knocked out of the competition. But while I have the concentration
to follow one-off games, I certainly couldn't doggedly follow a single
team's progress from game to game, year to year.

Skunk McGeordie has a slightly different problem. He has the
determination to follow a team, but unfortunately has, by accident of
birth, been forced to support his home team of Newcastle United. While
he has dutifully attended their abysmal matches for years on end, his
heart has always lain with Sunderland. Finally, he snaps, and decides
that he can no longer support Newcastle. He will become... a Sunderland
supporter. There is only one way for him to achieve his life's ambition,
and that is for him to progress through nine levels of platform action.
Obviously.

As in the original Jumping Jack, progress is made by jumping through
holes to the platform above. That in itself would be easy, were it not
for the fact that the holes move, and often while waiting for a hole to
appear above you one will appear below you, casting you to the platform
below to land in a stunned heap, where usually another hole will slide
beneath you and throw you down again, and so on until you hit the ground
and lose a life.

Apparently Neil Walker found the original formula a tad too easy, and so
he's added some bad guys to the equation. These will stun players for a
few seconds, usually enough time for another hole to catch up with you.
But to even the odds there are also 'safe zones'. Pressing the action
key will transport you magically into them, where you cannot be harmed
but can, if they're armed, throw fireballs across the screen. Surrealist
features like this are rife, with Alan Shearer-lookalikes ballet-dancing
across the screen, giant spiders, and trucks bearing the Retrospec logo.
The graphics are consistently bright and cartoony, and while the
animation is minimal, it does the job perfectly.

Best of all, though, JJ2 has a multiplayer mode. Up to four players can
challenge each other in Deathmatch Mode, which is where those fireballs
really come into play. For the friendless among you, you'll probably
appreciate the computer-controlled players. You can play Deathmatch
against up to 200 (!) of the things, although you'll need a better PC
than mine to do it in SVGA mode. This is a fine game, and a great way to
waste a few hours, especially with some mates. Although it'd be a good
idea to make sure they're not Newcastle supporters first.

<b>Graphics:</b> 80&deg;	Cartoony little sprites, some nice backgrounds really add to the atmosphere.<br>
<b>Sound:</b> 75&deg;	Some neat effects, although the MIDI music didn't seem to
work (probably my PC being crap, though).<br>
<b>Gameplay:</b> 90&deg; Clever incentive for getting further in single-player, and the
multiplayer mode means this game'll stay around for ages.<br>
<b>Gamelife:</b> 85&deg;	A simple control system makes JJ2 easy to get into, and
once you're in, you'll be in for a long time.<br><br>
<b>Summary:</b> A simple game, smartly-executed, with some great humour (if
you're not a Newcastle supporter!). Marvy.<br><br>
