You'll no doubt have noticed there's no Burgertime this month. Well, Jon
was beginning to feel queasy after all the cold food, and Nathan was
beginning to look a tad podgy, so instead we have for you a review of...
(wait for it)... the 929 Bristol to Taunton bus service!
<br><br>
Our fearless leader (that's Nathan) decided that in the interests of all
concerned he would make the journey alone. (Alright, so Jon evaded
taking part by pulling the old overworked student routine.)
<br><br>
<b>How Does It Work?</b><br>
Nathan singlehandedly, alone and with neither a support team or a safety
harness, boards the bus at Bristol's central bus station (currently up
for sale - place your bid now!). He gets off at Wells. This journey,
according to the timetable, should take about an hour. In this time, he
ponders the solutions to these familiar, yet slightly different
questions:
<ol>
<li><b>Ambiance:</b> What's the atmosphere on the bus like? Is everybody singing
Cliff Richards songs? Or is there a Mexican standoff at the back of the
bus between the drunks and drug addicts?</li>
<li><b>Staff:</b> How helpful and polite are the staff? Do they make you want to
take them with you when you get off the bus? Or do they make you want to
walk?</li>
<li><b>Speed:</b> How close to the timetable is the service? Is it as reliable
and on-time as Big Ben? Or is it as reliable and on-time as an issue of
YS3?</li>
<li><b>Comfort:</b> Are there big comfy armchairs all round for you to snuggle
down in and go to sleep? Or is the ride so bumpy you feel like you've
been in a giant spacehopper?</li>
<li><b>Value for Money:</b> Are the fares mere tokens, covering the bare
necessities of bringing you a bus service? Or does the price on the
ticket bear more resemblance to the national debt?</li>
<li><b>Overall:</b> The overall impression and enjoyment factor.</li>
</ol>

<b>The Service:</b> 929 Bristol to Taunton<br>
<b>Departure Time:</b> 15:20<br>
<b>Arrival Time:</b> 16:10 (Wells)<br>
<b>Single Fare:</b> £1.75 (£3.15 weekdays)<br>
<b>Return Fare:</b> £3.00 (£4.75 weekdays)<br>
<br>
<b>Ambiance: 8/10</b><br>
Typically for a Sunday afternoon, there were very few other passengers.
On a typical weekday at the same time, I would have been guaranteed a
minimum of two drunks, complete with can of Special Brew, preying on the
weak and defenceless with rather unlikely and decidedly unpleasant tales
of what they did in the war/in a London gang/last Tuesday. As it was, I
counted myself lucky only to be sharing the bus with a couple of
students.
<br><br>		
<b>Staff: 7/10</b><br>
A passenger's relationship with their driver is a simple and unerringly
brief one. This particular driver appeared pleasant enough; however,
eavesdropping on his conversation with another driver at the station
revealed that he had been moved from the main, city centre services due
to his behaviour towards a complaining passenger. This did not inspire
me with confidence as we left the station.
<br><br>		
<b>Speed: 9/10</b><br>
Unusually, today's bus was actually a couple of minutes early, both
leaving and arriving. A pleasant surprise given previous experience and
the 'don't blame us' attitude of the electronic timetable.
('Everything's okay, but if anything does go wrong it's not our fault,
got that?')
<br><br>		
<b>Comfort: 2/10</b><br>
I am convinced that the people who designed the bus I rode on today must
have owned a car from the day they were born, and was inflicting this
nightmarish seating on us commoners out of class-driven spite. Although
there were no less seats than on an average bus, the seats that there
were were so narrow as to force you to sit in a position as vertical as
a crash test dummy. My alternative (tirelessly enhanced on from many
months of travel on similar vehicles) is to take up two seats and sit
sideways. The only downside is that if the bus stops suddenly, you'll
fall on the floor. Today's posture of preference was a forty-five degree
turn, with one foot on the floor.
<br><br>		
<b>Value for Money: 5/10</b><br>
Given the distance travelled, the fares are reasonable enough. However,
given the seating, I feel it is only fair that the passengers should be
paid to make up for the extreme trauma of trying to sit on the bus for
anything up to two hours.
<br><br>		
<b>Overall: 6/10</b><br>
Naturally the service varies with both the time of day and the day of
the week; the evening journey back to Bristol was a much more pleasant
one, while rush hour journeys are a nightmare only a battery chicken
would feel comfortable in. This is all taken into account in my final
score. There is room for improvement, clearly, and hopefully FirstBus
will take our points into consideration and make the blimming seats
bigger.
