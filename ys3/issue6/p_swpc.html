Ah, Ultimate. The stuff of legends. Responsible for some stupidly
playable and unfeasibly advanced games, Ultimate also introduced one of
the Spectrum's biggest heroes - Sabreman. And now <b>Jeff Braine</b> is about
to resurrect him with a new remake.
<br><br>
Currently in the alpha phase (whatever that means), <i>Sabre Wulf PC</i>
appears to be progressing nicely. The biggest thing about the original
<i>Sabre Wulf</i> was the graphics. Clear, brightly-coloured, the sprites also
hammered about the screen like greased ferrets, and that's exactly what
they do in the remake too. Although the sprites are currently grabbed
straight from the original, <b>Pierre Jovanovic</b>'s background graphics
look absolutely lovely. Because Jeff loves us, he's also bunged us some
additional eye-candy for you to gawp at. We'll be keeping an eye on this
one; hopefully it'll be a little bit easier than the original, which is
still guaranteed to get me swearing at the old Speccy...
