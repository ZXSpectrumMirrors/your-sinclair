		<b>comp.sys.sinclair FAQ Updated</b><br><br>
Philip Kendall, maintainer of the revered c.s.s. FAQ (the Bible of Spec-chums) has updated the document, adding a number of new items and generally jiggling things about a bit. Still no improvement on our entry though, which, to recap, is as follows...<br><br>
'YS3 is hopefully going to be a montly on-line Speccy magazine; only one issue produced so far, which didn't have too much outstanding in it.' <br><br>
Tch, eh? We're not that bad, really.
