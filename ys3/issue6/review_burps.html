What's the deal with sheep? I mean, you can't do anything these days
without running into a sheep. They're on television, they're in books,
they're in magazines, and worst of all they're in computer games. I
remember the days when the only time you saw a sheep was when it was
sliced up and sitting on your plate. These days you're not even safe
when playing on your computer.

You may be wondering why I'm ranting about sheep. Well, Burps contains a
sheep. A sheep named Flossie. This sheep is one of three characters you
can play, trapped inside a phenomenally large castle. There's only one
way out - through the front door. Unfortunately, it's locked, which
means you have to find the key. And the key's been split into three
parts. Yes, that's right, it's Atic Atac, only the names have been
changed to protect the guilty.

I loved the original Atic Atac. I played it to death, and it took me
years to finally crack the thing. It was tough, but it was also fair.
The panic that set in as your energy bar dwindled, the chicken's flesh
falling from its bones, was absolute, and you'd hammer from screen to
screen desperately hunting for a quick snack to power your little sprite
back up again. Burps is very similar, albeit with different sprites. The
playable characters are very different; a sheep, a lunatic and a wizard.
They all fire the same old weapons, though, and die in exactly the same
way (which you'll see a lot of). It's all pretty close to the original
Ultimate classic.

The biggest difference you'll notice, though, is the map. The map is
completely different. The map is also very much bigger. You'll be
running about the layrinthine castle for hours before you know exactly
where you're going. Still, about an hour's play quickly revealed the
three parts of the key, and it was with a little disappointment that I
brought them back to the lobby for assembly. Picking up all three parts,
I hit the door and prepared for the end sequence. No dice. The door
stayed shut. Figuring that I'd put the key together in the wrong order,
I reassembled it and tried again. Still nothing. A few more combinations
were equally unsuccessful. An uneasy feeling stirred inside, and I
ventured out a little deeper into the castle, where I found the one
thing I didn't want to find - another key part. At least one of the
others was a dummy. Further exploration turned up more key parts, and I
got six before being killed (again).

Burps is a difficult game. The basic Atic Atac premise is difficult
enough, but with the addition of dummy key parts, the skill required is
ramped up quite high. This one is very, very tricky. If you've got the
perseverance, I'm sure it can be cracked. And, well, I finished the
original, so... How difficult can it be, really?

<b>Graphics:</b> 65&deg;	Generally nice graphics, although the sprites seems a little C64-esque at times<br>
<b>Sound:</b> 5&deg;	Eurgh.<br>
<b>Gameplay:</b> 80&deg; It's tough. It should be a while before you crack this one.<br>
<b>Gamelife:</b> 80&deg;	It's tough. It's very tough. It's also quite frustrating
when you have to try all those combinations of all those key parts while
trying to dodge/shoot the bad guys at the same time.<br><br>
<b>Summary:</b> A good Atic Atac remake that just might be a little too hard for it's own good.<br><br>
