After starring in the hit game <i>Bubble Bobble</i>, its spectacular sequel <i>Rainbow Islands</i>, and the almost completely unheard of <i>Parasol Stars</i>, Bub and Bob had become household names. Like Domestos. Or something. (Or perhaps not. Ahem.)
<br><br>
Anyway, one day, they just vanished. Nobody knew where, or why. Several theories were put forward to explain their disappearance. Some speculated that their girlfriends had once again been kidnapped, and the heroes had died in an attempt to rescue them (again). Others believed that they had themselves been kidnapped, and been viciously tortured by being forced to listen to ‘Somewhere Over The Rainbow’ for all eternity. A few thought that they had finally tired of their adventurous life and had gone to enjoy their retirement on a desert island.

But not one of these theories remotely approached the truth. For the first time, <i>YS3</i> can reveal the true story. In reality, the happy-go-lucky image that the brothers had portrayed over the years was nothing more than a façade to a dark tale of jealousy, resentment and betrayal. 
<br><br>
Bob had long been bitter about the adulation his brother had received over the years. Always, he complained, it was Bub who took the lead role in their adventures. Trouble first flared during <i>Bubble Bobble</i>, when the brothers argued over a giant diamond that fell from above. Bub claimed that he was nearer to it, and it was his. Bob countered that since he had caused it to fall, it was rightfully his to claim. Lightning and fire flared as both grew angry. Meanwhile the diamond disappeared.

This, however, was a mere hint of the huge rift which was to grow between the two brothers. Bob caught Bub blowing bubbles at his girlfriend. Bub said in his defence that he was only a computer sprite, but Bob refused to accept his excuses. He abandoned his brother, leaving him at the mercy of a group of monsters. Somehow, Bub escaped, but this was the beginning of the end. Eventually, after countless disputes, Bob walked out on his brother for good. 
<br><br>
Rumour has it that Bob is now living on one of the Rainbow islands, where he is biding his time, waiting for the right time to return and take revenge on his brother. Bub, meanwhile, was last seen behind the counter of a chip shop in Hereford, where his lightning-cooked chips are proving to be a huge success. No-one knows the future for these once heroic brothers. Rest assured that <i>YS3</i> will be the first to let you know.
