<b>Number Ten - Patrick Moore</b>

What was that? Speak up, young man. The Speccy? What on Earth do you mean? Hold this chart for a moment, will you? Now what were you trying to ask me?
Oh, you mean the ZX Spectrum do you? What? Don't be silly, young man. It's a ZX Spectrum, not a 'Speccy'. Young people today. Abbreviate everything, they do.

Why are you asking me about the ZX Spectrum? I'm an astronomer, don't you know. Don't you want to ask me something about the stars? Most people ask
me if there's life on other planets. There probably is somewhere, you know. It's hard to believe that with all... what are you coughing like that for? Oh, very well. The
ZX Spectrum eh? Well, it's a wonderful little machine isn't it? Although far surpassed by the wonders of modern technology. Hmmm. No, of course there
aren’t ZX Spectrums on other planets! And I told you before, it’s not a ‘Speccy’. Tch. Anyway, I programmed my own star charts, you know. Oh yes. I spent
hours typing in those programs. I wouldn’t be where I am today if it wasn’t for the Speccy. I’d like you to see my constellations. I’m particularly proud of
Casseiopeia. The nebulae in that… stop yawning! Didn't you sleep last night? Tut tut, young people today. They've no stamina. What did you say? Yes, they do
abbreviate everything too. You seem like a sensible young man, I must say. What was I saying?

Games? I didn't have much time to play games, young man. But I must confess, I did enjoy that Captain Blood. Did you know you could fly through space for hours
and hours? Although the ridiculous illustrations of planetary surfaces annoyed me considerably, I must say. And the creatures! Pah. Still, it was jolly good fun. What?
No, I never got to the end of it. Where's the fun in that? What? Don't be ridiculous, of course there wasn't a naked woman in it! Young people today. Tch. Obsessed
with sex, they are. But they've got no stamina, so they usually abbrev... that's a nasty cough you have there, young man. Have some water. But back to sex. Did I tell
you about the time I nearly had... where are you going? Come back! Tch, young people today. No manners.
