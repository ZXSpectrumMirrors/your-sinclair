<h1>LOAD</h1>
There are five different addressing modes.

<h2>1. Direct Addressing</h2>

<font face="courier new">LD A, (0F1C)</font>
<br><br>
This loads the contents of 0F1C into the A-register. Note that, by convention, the movement is from right to left, so that we can write:
<br><br>
<font face="courier new">LD (0F1C), A</font>
<br><br>
and mean "copy the contents of the A-register into 0F1C".
<br><br>
The A-register is the only 8-bit register that can be directly addressed.

<h2>2. Indirect Addressing</h2>

<font face="courier new">LD A, (HL)</font>
<br><br>
This means "load the A-register <i>through</i> (ie from the address contained in) the HL register". To pass data in the opposite direction
we could have:
<br><br>
<font face="courier new">LD (HL), A</font>
<br><br>
which puts the contents of A into the address <i>contained</i> in HL. (For this instruction, registers other than A are allowed.)

<h2>3. Indexed addressing</h2>

Here, we need to indicate which index register is in use, and the amount of the offset:
<br><br>
<font face="courier new">LD A, (IX+2E)</font>
<br><br>
Note that in direct addressing, I showed an address of 4 hex digits, because 16 bits (2 bytes) are allowed for the address. The offset value in an indexed address instruction must be held in 1 byte, however, so I've only shown two hex digits.

<h2>4. Register-to-register</h2>

We can transfer data between registers like this:
<br><br>
<font face="courier new">LD D, B</font>
<br><br>
which means "load the contents of B into D".


<h2>5. Immediate</h2>

Here, data itself, rather than the address of data, is placed in the address field. So we can write:
<br><br>
<font face="courier new">LD B, 07</font>
<br><br>
to mean "put the number 7 in B". Note again that the number is two hex digits, since it has to be stored in the single byte of the B-register. Note also that a "LD" is really a <i>copy</i>: the numbers are retained in their original addresses or registers, but a copy is placed at the destination.
