For now we'll ignore the alternate register set - you can get by perfectly well without ever touching them. (The Gameboy's Z80-based processor doesn't have them, and GB programmers do okay.)
<br><br>
The registers appear in pairs, indicating that they may be used either as 8-bit or 16-bit registers. For instance, we can refer to the B-register (8 bits), or the C-register (8 bits) or the BC register (16 bits). The B, C, D, E, H and L registers can all be used in this way (in pairs BC, DE, and HL <i>only</i>) but the A and F registers are strictly 8-bit registers and cannot be combined.
<br><br>
There are two index registers, the IX and IY, a stack pointer (SP) and program counter (PC). Again, these are not registers we shall dwell on too much. It's the main general-purpose set that we shall be dealing with, since they are the fastest and most useful.
