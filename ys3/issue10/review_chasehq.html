Remember when you’re walking down the street, and from behind you hear the blaring of sirens and the squeal of tyres? You spin round to see a sporty car bearing down on you, engine pushing it forward as fast as it can, the brakes leaving rubber on the road. Then, mere seconds behind, you see the police car, matching the crook turn for turn. It all lasts only a couple of seconds before they’re both gone, screaming round a corner at speeds your driving instructor certainly wouldn’t like. Well, in <i>Chase H.Q.</i> you get to be the cops.</font>

OK, to be more precise, you get to be the wheelman for the cops, but the important thing is that you get to drive the car, sirens blaring and going at well above the speed limit in order to apprehend the villains and bring justice to the streets. Except the cops in <i>Chase H.Q.</i> do the whole “justice” thing a little differently to those that we might know… gone are the days of chasing the baddy and politely asking them to pull over. Now they are rammed until their car gives out, then arrested for their misdemeanour. Nancy, the ops girl at base, radios in each mission as you go along, giving you an escaping baddy to catch up with and bash into submission. If you catch up with them in sixty seconds, and disable them in a further sixty, then it’s onto the next one. Just like the arcade, in fact.

And as an arcade conversion, the Speccy <i>Chase H.Q.</i> stands pretty proud. The graphics are nice and big, it all moves along at a fair rate, all the radio chatter is there, and the gameplay maintains the excitement of the chase. And the chase is what it’s all about (as the title might suggest), charging after the baddie and bringing them in before they get away. Traffic is dodged, corners and tunnels are navigated, all to catch up with the elusive villain of the piece. There’s a certain something about charging down the road with someone to catch before the timer runs out, and the appeal stays as you try and ram your quarry off the road before they get away. It’s classic car chase stuff as seen in countless movies, except that you get to do it. And what great fun it is, as far as it goes.

Since this conversion is so good, the only real critiques are those which would be levelled at the arcade itself. The main one is just that, that it is an arcade game. It’s meant to be played for five minutes, tops, for a few coins. And as perfectly as that survives to the home market, it suffers from the repetitiveness that plagues so many good arcade games upon repeated play; they’re just not really designed for it. Yes, the chase is fun, but the appeal begins to wane after the third or fourth level. Chase the car, whack the car, chase the car, whack the car. I’m afraid we need a bit more than that to make it stand up to regular home play, though the design is great for five minutes in your local coin-op.

Some might also claim that it’s a bit tough, the collisions and time limit being as unforgiving as they are. The “lo” and “hi” gear is immensely irritating, and serves almost no purpose, other then slowing you down some more when you try to pull away. Wiping the baddie’s hit bar and putting you a good ten seconds or so behind them again does the game no further favours, and the car itself handles rather more like a Ford Fiesta than a souped-up police chaser of doom. All of these are pretty minor niggles by themselves, but they do nothing to help the case of a game that is already looking less than totally comfortable away from the arcade. It’s good for a laugh, but don’t expect much past the short-term.
