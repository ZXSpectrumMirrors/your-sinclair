<i>Scene: A battered apartment somewhere in downtown Bristol, belonging to Jon. The fan overhead beats slowly, doing little to reduce the humidity in the tattered room, looking like it was furnished with rejects from the local tip. Unshaven and unkempt, Jon is taking another swig from a nearly-empty bottle of Scotch when there is a knock on the door. He thinks for a few seconds, and then decides to open it. A number of well-dressed gentlemen walk in and arrange themselves around the room as Jeff takes a seat on the couch.</i>

<b>Jon:</b> Er, hello, Jeff. Nice to see you.<br>
<b>Jeff:</b> And top o’ the evening to you, too, Jon. The boys and I were in the neighbourhood, catching up with a few people (<i>one of the well-dressed gentlemen cracks his knuckles</i>), and we thought we’d drop in and see you, what with the review of Mugsy coming out in this month’s <i>YS3</i>. Thought you might like some group feedback on it, to help your journalistic endeavour.<br>
<b>Jon:</b> That’s er, very kind of you, Jeff. (<i>He motions to a battered old typewriter on a desk in the corner</i>) I was just getting ready to write. Scotch really helps the old creative juices to flow, you know. Well, look who I’m telling, the king of creative expression.<br>

<b>Jeff:</b> I do like to be creative in my work, Jon. I find it to be an expression of myself, like some other folks might paint, or sculpt, or draw, or write poetry. I respect that, and I loved Spike Milligan’s The ABC. It was beautiful, right, Tom?<br>
<b>Tom:</b> Bootiful, boss. Just bootiful.<br>
<b>Jon:</b> Yes, beautiful. Like the graphics in <i>Mugsy</i>. They look great, they do. Really atmospheric, with that 30s touch on every curve and table. It looks just like one of those covers from a P. G. Woodhouse novel. I loved them.<br>
<b>Jeff:</b> You didn’t think they were a bit static, Jon? Not a lot of animation, is there? It’s hardly <i>Prince of Persia</i>, I’m sure.<br>
<b>Jon:</b> Right, but that’s not really important. Good graphics do not necessarily make a good game, and <i>Mugsy</i> never pretends to be a graphics-driven game.<br>

<b>Tom:</b> I think the emphasis on the management creates an environment where the graphics are merely the icing on a complex cake of wheeling, dealing and organising, boss.<br>
<b>Jeff:</b> Hmmm… what do you think of that, Jon?<br>
<b>Jon:</b> He’s right! Spot on, you know, I couldn’t have put it better myself. The point of the game is to manage your mafi… er… business assets, to, err…<br>
<b>Tom:</b> If I may, boss, I think Jon’s speaking of the precarious business of profit and loss, managing limited resources to attain all the necessary goals.<br>
<b>Jeff:</b> I see. So the focus is very much on the managing, then? There’s not really any “hands-on” work, as it were.<br>
<b>Jon:</b> Not really, but when you’re at the top, delegation is the name of the game. It’s enough to decide how to distribute the money to keep everything ticking over, from manpower, to tools and, of course, the, er… legal side of things.<br>

<b>Jeff:</b> Is this not rather simple, just entering a few numbers to buy things? Wouldn’t you rather have more say, perhaps directing the manpower and deciding how to apply those tools? The interactivity sounds quite limited.<br>
<b>Jon:</b> Well, maybe, but it creates a truly engrossing little world, and you really care about the consequences of your decisions. It’s quite remarkable.<br>
<b>Jeff:</b> Jon, we’re here to receive your professional opinion as to how good this game is. We want it to sell well, we’ve got many resources, er, tied up, you might say, in this little venture. I would be most dissatisfied if it were to sell badly.<br>

<b>Tom:</b> You sure would be, boss. Dissatisfied. (<i>Looks meaningfully at Jon.</i>)<br>
<b>Jon (<i>Swallowing hard as he takes his life in his hands</i>):</b> Well, I suppose it could use greater involvement on the part of the player. It does all feel a little, er, well, that is to say…<br>
<b>Tom:</b> Arbitrary?<br>
<b>Jon:</b> Rather a harsh word, I feel, but, yes, maybe a little.<br>
<b>Jeff:</b> I see.<br>
<b>Jon:</b> But bear in mind that this is the first game, Jeff. There’s more slack given, and it really is a nice little opener. Gives you somewhere to go now. Perhaps you could update it on the PC in a few years, add some more interactivity and options, and it would go down a storm again. Really. But for 1984 it’s a sterling first entry. Top stuff.<br>
<b>Jeff:</b> Thank you for your honesty, Jon. I appreciate your candidness. Well, we must be going now, I’m afraid.<br>
<b>Jon (<i>Eagerly</i>):</b> Other places to go? People to see? Fish to fry? (<i>Under his breath</i>) Oh, crap in a bag.<br>
<b>Jeff:</b> Yes, well. Thank you for your time, and we’ll make sure that <i>YS3</i> gets to use the server this month. Break a leg, eh? (<i>Smiles broadly</i>) Cheers, now. C’mon, lads. (<i>Jon smiles weakly as they leave, finishing the bottle of scotch in one swig as the door closes</i>)<br>
