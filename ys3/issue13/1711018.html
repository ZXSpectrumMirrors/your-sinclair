Coffee ceased, fresh water was cut off, the men from BT cut the phone cables, but when the Toffee Cream Slices in the fridge were no longer replenished Jon could take no more. Silent and grim in his determination, it was off to the local newsagent for some morning work on a bike which could neatly tie into an existing Speccy game - shelf-stacker! No, wait, that’s not right...</i></p></font><font  color="#000000"><p id="edtxt"></p></font><font  color="#000000"><p id="edtxt"><b>Monday</b></p></font><font  color="#000000"><p id="edtxt">Desperate to make the first morning punctually, Jon slept not a wink the night before and was already standing outside the newsagent with a glassy stare (he needs them for long distances) when the owner arrived at 4am. By 4:03am he was loaded up, and on the bike. By 5:37am he had perfected the art of not falling of the bike with a giant satchel of newspapers slung over his back, and it was off on the paper round! However, Nathan was not amused at his desertion to another employer (especially since he had the paper to prove he owned Jon’s eternal soul) and sent the remaining bods on a merciless campaign of violence to end the betrayal. It was Phil’s turn on the first day, and he decided to start the old-fashioned way. A myriad of highly trained and vicious mongrels were set on the unfortunate ex-YS3 reviewer from outside nearly every house as he cycled by, but as they leapt up to eat Jon from behind, their teeth met with the copies of Oxford Student in his bag. A trail of deceased pooches were left in his wake as the sheer awfulness of the publication went straight for their nervous systems. Unfortunately for Phil, the last dog had been watching the slaughter of its friends and decided to eat him instead.</p></font><font  color="#000000"><p id="edtxt">But the canine efforts had not been in vain; robbed of half his newspapers, the list of subscribers was dwindling.</p></font><font  color="#000000"><p id="edtxt"></p></font></td></tr></table><table width="100%"><tr><td align="left"></td><td align="right"><p id="normtxt"><a href="17110122.html">Forward&gt;&gt;</a></p></td></tr></table><center><p id="normtxt"><b><a href="index1.html">Back to Contents</a></b></p></center></td></tr></table></center></body>
