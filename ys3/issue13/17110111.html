Back in the good old days, those lovely boys at the Big O would cheerfully whack out game of film after game of film with their neat little plan: a level of running around doing platform stuff, a vehicle level, a thinky level, a vehicle level, a platform level, and so on. <i>Total Recall</i> followed this pattern, and so does <i>Batman</i> though, as I'm sure you'll be pleased to hear, with rather better results. Of course, <i>Robocop</i> broke the mould by opting for many levels of frenetic shooting (and a bit of thought half-way through), but what else could you do with the license of a gun-toting cyborg?</p></font><font  color="#fefe00"><p id="normtxt"></p></font><img src="rimg/b1.gif" align="right"><font  color="#fefe00"><p id="normtxt">Well, old <i>Batman</i> is a little different. Rather than opting for the aluminium-wearing, gun-toting approach for cleaning up the streets, he prefers the rather more gentlemanly and sneaky "I am the night" line. He carefully picks his way around, dodging or dispatching hoodlums who cross his path, using his batarang&reg; to reach those tricky places and running away from the cops. And in this respect at least, <i>Batman: The Movie</i> does a credible job. The first level follows the usual platform blueprint, but the use of batarangs&reg; and the bat rope to climb and swing helps the game in the same way that throwing a lightsabre into a <i>Star Wars</i> title picks it up. There's something undeniably Batman-like about clambering across platforms and swinging your merry way to the confrontation with Jack Napier at the end (and he does fall such a nice distance into that vat of acid); it really puts a step in one's caped shoes. The Batmobile chase that is level two doesn't fare quite so well; the basic idea is that you drive from left to right, and then fire out your rope when the arrow in front of the car points to the right; catching a convenient lamp-post, you turn round the corner and onto another street. Repeat enough times and you reach the Batcave; fail to catch one, and you end up in a police road block which you can't escape (apparently Batman doesn't believe in reverse gears (<i>Actually, holding down fire and the direction turns you around. D'oh. Ed</i>)). Although the swinging round corners is fun, and you do get a nice speed going, it all becomes rather repetitive rather quickly, and there is precious little sense of being chased or needing to get away from the police; it seems more like you're in a hurry to get home, presumably because there's some frozen goods in the car.</p></font><font  color="#fefe00"><p id="normtxt"></p></font><img src="rimg/b2.gif" align="left"><font  color="#fefe00"><p id="normtxt">Level three puts you in the Batcave, analysing the toxic formula behind the gas that the Joker has just released on an unsuspecting Gotham city. It's a fairly straightforward puzzle affair, given some sense of impending doom by the strict time limit, and it's kind of fun to play with the computer a bit. After sussing the formula, Batman leaps into his bat-shaped plane to sort out the balloons full of gas which are heading into the city, before entering the cathedral for the final confrontation with Mr. Laughter himself. Both are curiously similar to the first two levels, the Batwing level faring the best out of the two in terms of variety. The cathedral could almost be the factory with a bigger map and slightly different background graphics. Although points do go to <i>Ocean</i> for a refreshing lack of bosses, the same amount are almost immediately deducted for using the same blueprint as always and shamelessly mirroring almost the same levels around the middle, puzzle-based one.</p></font><font  color="#fefe00"><p id="normtxt"></p></font><img src="rimg/b3.gif" align="right"><font  color="#fefe00"><p id="normtxt">As I mentioned before, being in the Batmobile and swinging around on the bat rope do help build a sense of atmosphere, but it is difficult to see this game standing without the license and characters to inject a bit of life into it. Two huge platform levels is a valid design choice, but ultimately pretty uninspiring. There are some restart points (which is nice), but not only are the two levels almost identical and not desperately enthralling, but they fail to do justice to the plot of the film. What about the museum? What about the intro chase over the rooftops to set the scene? What of the police in the chemical factor and the escaping Jack? It feels more like it's his fortress which you're trying to invade. What of the showdown around the bell, or even the bell crashing down? It's nice to jump straight in, but much of the plot remains seriously underdeveloped. The vehicle levels are pleasant, if a bit repetitive, but again do not feel to do complete justice to the film. The Batmobile certainly feels rather underpowered, and the driving somewhat disjointed as the street resets left-to-right after each corner.</p></font><font  color="#fefe00"><p id="normtxt"></p></font><font  color="#fefe00"><p id="normtxt">They certainly help bring some variety to the mix, but ultimately one feels to be playing spotted highlights of the main plot points, rather than a carefully-developed interactive version of the movie. The sprites are bold (though I'm sure the falling baddie sprite is lifted straight from <i>Robocop</i>), the levels not overly violence-oriented but involve some strategy and sneaking (as fits the character) and the content fairly varied. But ultimately it feels like a movie cash-in, designed with only a basic respect for the story and the people involved. It's good fun being the Batman; but if the cape were not there, I doubt anyone would give it a second look.</p></font><font  color="#fefe00"><p id="normtxt"></p></font></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><table width=600 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0><tr><td><img src="rimg/score_63.gif" alt="0"></td><td><table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0 width=144><tr><td background="logo/rtop.gif" height=27 width=144>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td align="left" background="logo/gfx.gif" height=38 width=144><font face="arial" size="5"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;79&deg;</b></font></td></tr><tr><td align="left" background="logo/snd.gif" height=38 width=144><font face="arial" size="5"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;57&deg;</b></font></td></tr><tr><td align="left" background="logo/lex.gif" height=38 width=144><font face="arial" size="5"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;41&deg;</b></font></td></tr><tr><td align="left" background="logo/gmp.gif" height=38 width=144><font face="arial" size="5"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;62&deg;</b></font></td></tr><tr><td align="left" background="logo/rbot.gif" height=29 width=144>&nbsp;</td></tr></table></td><td align="left" background="logo/rsum.gif" height=208 width=380><font face="arial" size="3">An entertaining but uninspired little game which is made more enjoyable by the license it ultimately fails to properly use.<br><br><b>Jon Hyde</b></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%"><tr><td align="left"></td><td align="right"></td></tr></table><center><p id="normtxt"><b><a href="index1.html">Back to Contents</a></b></p></center></td></tr></table></center></body>
