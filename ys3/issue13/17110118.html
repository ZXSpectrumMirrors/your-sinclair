Seems you poms have got a few nasty problems over there right now. I've selected the most serious ones for this page - hope it'll help you all. We start with this beaut little letter that got pushed through the door here at YS3 HQ. Strange.</i></p></font><font  color="#000000"><p id="normtxt"></p></font><font  color="#000000"><p id="normtxt">Dear Doc Karl,</p></font><font  color="#000000"><p id="normtxt"></p></font><font  color="#000000"><p id="normtxt">I saw how you helped that Elvic guy in the last issue and I hope you can do the same for me. My problem is this: I'm addicted to pastries and I keep stealing them from my workplace. I think my colleagues are on to me - I keep finding they drop hints about going down to the shops to buy more.</p></font><font  color="#000000"><p id="normtxt"></p></font><font  color="#000000"><p id="normtxt">Even worse is the fact that I'm not even eating them all any more.

First, congratulations on acknowledging that stealing pastries from your colleagues is not a good thing. Not only are you depriving them of a tasty snack, but it's certain to be having a bad effect on your body and your character. You're going to get fat and you might end up stealing other things compulsively as well. So here's what I suggest you do: come clean to your colleagues and they should hopefully be understanding. Once you've got their support, you should visit your local Stealers of Kipling Cakes Society, or SOKCS. They'll put you on an intensive programme which should hopefully cure your addiction. Good luck mate!</i></p></font><font  color="#000000"><p id="normtxt"></p></font><font  color="#000000"><p id="normtxt"><i>I can't help feeling there's something odd about this letter.

I can't write to any other doctor nationally because they'll sell my story to the papers. Recently I was out and about when I was hit by an egg, and I hit the man responsible. Then everyone started making fun of me, calling me things like 'Two Jabs'. Now my boss is saying that he's going to sack me and that I've let down my country. What can I do to keep my job?
