Imagine that you spent practically your whole life playing computer games. From the first game of Space Invaders, you were hooked, and from then on it was games, games, games, all the way through the Spectrum, the Megadrive, the SNES, and a dozen other consoles and computers. So, after fifteen years or so, you've got quite a lot of experience with games, and you've got mad skillz that'd make Tommy's crazy flipper fingers jealous. Then, one morning you wake up in a darkened room. There's a strange, dusty black computer plugged into a TV running a game you haven't played since you finished it in your childhood. For a laugh, you decide to finish it again. But when you try to play it turns out that you're rubbish. That's when you notice the scar on your ego. While you were sleeping, somebody removed your skillz...</p></font><font  color="#00007f"><p id="normtxt"></p></font><font  color="#00007f"><p id="normtxt">No, really. It's based on a true story, too. It really happened to a friend of mine. His name was, well, to save him any embarrassment, let's call him Huan Jyde. (<i>Thanks... Thanks a lot. 'Huan'.</i>) See, he used to be really good at this game, <i>Chuckie Egg</i>. He used to have no problems getting to level twenty, even level thirty. He was the king of <i>Chuckie Egg</i>. He got a SNES, though, and stopped playing the old games, and by the time he next played the game someone had taken away his gameplaying ability and he couldn't get off the second level. (What happened to him? He went on to review games for a webzine. Yeah, some places'll hire anybody.)</p></font><font  color="#00007f"><p id="normtxt"></p></font><img src="rimg/ChuckieEgg2.jpg" align="right"><font  color="#00007f"><p id="normtxt">Anyway. Huan'd probably be right at home on the first level of this game. It's not the first <i>Chuckie Egg</i> remake, but it's arguably the best-presented. The stylish Retrospec splash screen promises much, and once past the console-esque front end, the game at once begins to deliver. It's fast and smooth, Charlie Chuck gliding smoothly about the screen while the chickens wander their way amidst the bird seed and eggs. The high resolution of the game, combined with a constantly-moving backdrop, at first serves only to distract, and the sheer size of the playing area compared with that of the original is at first overwhelming. But once you get into it, the speed with which you can move around means that the size of the screen is not the problem it first appears. The soft-edged cartoon graphics are smoothly detailed, which, while initially causing problems finding your character at the start of a level, soon blend into the background once you start moving around. One thing that does serve as a constant distraction, albeit one you can learn to live with, is the parallax-scrolling grid behind the action. The screenshots can't get across the hypnotic effect the grid has as it slides before your eyes.</p></font><font  color="#00007f"><p id="normtxt"></p></font><img src="rimg/ChuckieEgg3.jpg" align="left"><font  color="#00007f"><p id="normtxt">As console-esque as it may appear on the surface, there's no hiding its roots. <i>The Next Batch</i> is as tough as the original <i>Chuckie Egg</i> was. The controls seem to have been eased up a little, and its easier to get around, but the challenge has been beefed up to compensate. There's a duck on constant patrol, weaving back and forth across the screen, just in case the newer, faster chickens weren't enough to stop you. And these new chickens have been trained not to eat the birdseed, too; no longer can you leave behind those bonuses in the hopes that they'll serve as a tasty distraction to your pursuers. Now you just have to grab everything and get the heck out of the level you're on. But then there's the next level...</p></font><font  color="#00007f"><p id="normtxt"></p></font><font  color="#00007f"><p id="normtxt"><i>Chuckie Egg: The Next Batch</i> is a darned fine game. It's easy to get into, has some great graphics and music, and best of all it has joypad support, which should make it easier for Huan to play. After all, consoles don't have keyboards, do they?</p></font></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><table width=600 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0><tr><td><img src="rimg/score_88.gif" alt="0"></td><td><table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0 width=144><tr><td background="logo/rtop.gif" height=27 width=144>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td align="left" background="logo/gfx.gif" height=38 width=144><font face="arial" size="5"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;80&deg;</b></font></td></tr><tr><td align="left" background="logo/snd.gif" height=38 width=144><font face="arial" size="5"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;85&deg;</b></font></td></tr><tr><td align="left" background="logo/lex.gif" height=38 width=144><font face="arial" size="5"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;89&deg;</b></font></td></tr><tr><td align="left" background="logo/gmp.gif" height=38 width=144><font face="arial" size="5"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;85&deg;</b></font></td></tr><tr><td align="left" background="logo/rbot.gif" height=29 width=144>&nbsp;</td></tr></table></td><td align="left" background="logo/rsum.gif" height=208 width=380><font face="arial" size="3">At least as good as the original, and better in quite a few ways.
