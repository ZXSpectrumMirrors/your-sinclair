Jon was happily delivering his papers when the vengeful YS3 journalist’s request from his SG-C mates in the air force came through. An entire squadron of F-14s came tearing over the small hamlet in which Jon operated. Shadows of fighter planes came streaking across the ground, followed by the hail of missiles that were their combined payload.
