As Jon was merrily chucking newspapers into non-subscribers’ windows, dustbins and gravestones, he failed to notice the shadowy character sneaking up on him. Well, sneaking if you discount the incredible din of Jeff’s sit-on lawnmower trundling up the pavement, blades scraping on the concrete.</p></font><font  color="#000000"><p id="edtxt">Jon suddenly spotted him, and in an effort to lose him turned off the road and into a disused and dried-out canal way with high concrete walls on each side. He pedalled furiously, but the lawnmower drew inexorably closer, gaining until it nudged the bike from behind. Panicked, Jon glanced behind to see the pursuing vehicle bearing down on him. It looked like his push-bike wouldn’t be enough but, just as all seemed lost, a mysterious leather-clad figure on a scooter sped into the chase, and grabbed the unfortunate paperboy from his bicycle as it fell under the blades of the lawnmower.</p></font><font  color="#000000"><p id="edtxt">The chase was tense as the scooter tried to lose the dogged pursuer, inches remaining between the two as the gap grew, shrank, grew and shrank again. But the lawnmower put on a spurt, and just as it looked like the scooter would suffer the same fate as the bicycle, a low bridge appeared. Jon screaming like a girl, the leather clad figure dropped the scooter onto its side and slid under the bridge in a trail of sparks. Stopping a few metres from the bridge they looked back to see the lawnmower hit the bridge, tearing the front windshield off (it’s a special lawnmower).</p></font><font  color="#000000"><p id="edtxt">For a moment it looked like it was slowing down, but then Jeff suddenly resurfaced from behind the steering wheel and the chase recommenced. The scooter did well, but could not escape. The distance was steadily decreasing, but then Jon had a plan. Throwing his saviour under the blades of the mower, Jon wrestled the scooter back up a bank, using a newspaper to break the lock on the door in the chain-link fence surrounding the old canal. Back on his old route he put the scooter flat out, and although the increase in distance was only temporary, it bought him enough time. The end of the road was reached, and the obstacle course began. Both slid round the dirt track until they reached the first jump. Jon went first, but as Jeff made his attempt a well-placed newspaper knocked the mower off its trajectory and neatly into the middle of one of the bullseyes.</p></font><font  color="#000000"><p id="edtxt">Unfortunately, though, the chase had cost Jon a few more subscribers. The list grew shorter.</p></font><font  color="#000000"><p id="edtxt"></p></font></td></tr></table><table width="100%"><tr><td align="left"><p id="normtxt"><a href="17110131.html">&lt;&lt;Back</a></p></td><td align="right"><p id="normtxt"><a href="17110132.html">Forward&gt;&gt;</a></p></td></tr></table><center><p id="normtxt"><b><a href="index1.html">Back to Contents</a></b></p></center></td></tr></table></center></body>
