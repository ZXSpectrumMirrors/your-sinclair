The basic idea being that the new robot would keep an eye on the action and make sure that nothing naughty happened. Now, there are several rather obvious problems with this. First, it's an arena nowhere near the size of a football pitch. Second, there are only two competitors, and it doesn't stretch the BBC's camera set-up to watch both of them at the same time. Third, THERE ARE NO RULES. The competitors are there to break each other using whatever means they've taken into the arena. They've already been checked to make sure their weight and weapons are within the guidelines. There's nothing else to keep an eye on that can't be done perfectly well by the other cameras.</p></font><font  color="#000000"><p id="normtxt"></p></font><font  color="#000000"><p id="normtxt">It wouldn't be so bad, and I wouldn't be quite so annoyed, if the 'Ref-Bot' was just redundant. However, it's much worse than that. The 'Ref-Bot' is about the same size and speed as 'Sir Killalot'. This means it's unfeasibly slow, especially compared to all the 'amateur' robots. Without fail, the 'Ref-Bot' gets in the way of the competitors, particularly during the opening seconds of a match. Those first few seconds are vital, often deciding where the rest of the battle goes. And without fail, the 'Ref-Bot' removes the opportunity to maneuvre on one half of the arena.</p></font><font  color="#000000"><p id="normtxt"></p></font><font  color="#000000"><p id="normtxt">Its size also means that for approximately half the match the 'Ref-Bot' is between a robot and its controller. In certain circumstances, this means that a controller is attempting to operate a robot he cannot see, particularly when being piled into a corner by nearly half a dozen House Robots. And while pinned, there is occasionally a moment's pause in which a competitor could feasibly escape. Feasible, that is, were it not for the useless pile of tin that is the superfluous 'Ref-Bot', which inevitably is 'observing' in just the place the robot that the show is supposed to be about needs to go.</p></font><font  color="#000000"><p id="normtxt"></p></font><font  color="#000000"><p id="normtxt">Whoever thinks the 'Ref-Bot' is a good idea should be offered the opportunity to walk down a street while a WWF wrestler stands in front of them, repeatedly muttering 'sorry' and taking backward steps further into their path. Because that's what trying to play Robot Wars is like with that stupid bloody 'Ref-Bot'.</p></font><font  color="#000000"><p id="normtxt"></p></font><font  color="#000000"><p id="normtxt"></p></font><font  color="#000000"><p id="normtxt"></p></font><font  color="#000000"><p id="normtxt"><h3>WWF STYLE</h3></p></font><font  color="#000000"><p id="normtxt"></p></font><img src="img/killalot.gif" align="right"><font  color="#000000"><p id="normtxt">Speaking of the WWF (and I mean, of course, the occasionally entertaining but always predictable 'phenomenon' that is American wrestling), Robot Wars has begun to fancy itself as a geeky British version. In the new series, Robot Wars Extreme (nnggh), the 'Ref-Bot' is now actually doing something other than get in the way. It's counting immobilised robots out and issuing yellow and red cards to the House Robots. Now, you might think this a good thing. Look, the 'Ref-Bot' is useful after all!</p></font><font  color="#000000"><p id="normtxt"></p></font><font  color="#000000"><p id="normtxt">Except, of course, it's not. It's still big and ugly, and it's still getting in the way. And immobilised robots were counted out before we had a 'Ref-Bot', and House Robots are still interfering with a genuine competition, it's just that now the show is admitting it. It just highlights the failure of the House Robots concept even further.</p></font><font  color="#000000"><p id="normtxt"></p></font><font  color="#000000"><p id="normtxt"></p></font><font  color="#000000"><p id="normtxt"><h3>IT'S CRAP</h3></p></font><font  color="#000000"><p id="normtxt"></p></font><font  color="#000000"><p id="normtxt">It could have been so good. It could have been a genuinely exciting competition. It could have been genuinely entertaining. But the results are decided by the show's makers rather than the competitors, and enforced by way of the House Robots. The presenters are more interested in the physically ugly and socially inept children the competitors have dragged along for emotional pull among the audience, the commentator is more interested in thinking of metaphors for the hole in the arena floor and the sex-life of an inanimate robot than in the competition, and the audience just want to see Sir Killalot cut a robot in two anyway. And those of us who want to see an honourable battle between a couple of home-built robots? We'll keep watching. We're all still hoping that another able competitor will some day turn crazy and annihilate the House Robots.</p></font></td></tr></table><table width="100%"><tr><td align="left"><p id="normtxt"><a href="17110152.html">&lt;&lt;Back</a></p></td><td align="right"></td></tr></table><center><p id="normtxt"><b><a href="index1.html">Back to Contents</a></b></p></center></td></tr></table></center></body>
