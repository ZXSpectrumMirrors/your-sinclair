Or is it completely schnaable Mate?<br></li><br><li><b>Food Quality</b><br>Is it fair dinkum Aussie tucker or is it so vile a dingo would rather wash its nads to get rid of the taste?<br></li><br><li><b>Staff</b><br>Are they Good As Gold Mate?

The sea views are exceptional and the crash of waves on the beach and slap of flipflops against feet is rather soothing. People are milling in and out, but it's rather discerning if you try to talk to them - all they ever say is "rubarb". The music on the stereo is a bit crap - the same song over and over again and it's beginning to grate on my nerves. The decor is a little dated, with adverts for a band called Frente (who disappeared into Aussie obscurity years ago) playing a gig at Summer Bay High back in 95. Still it's got a good view of the beach, and there seems to have been a shortage of material for bathing costumes... <b>8/10</b><br><br></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><h2>Food Quality:</h2><br><b>Jeff:</b> Well I don't think much of Fisher's fishy fingers. They're more rubbery than a Speccy keyboard, and I'm not going to even TRY to come up with a humorous way of describing the taste in case I get fired. The chips are nice, if a little soggy, and the coffee is cold and tastes vaguely of beetroot. <b>4/10</b><br><br></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><h2>Staff:</h2><br><b>Jeff:</b> Sullen and speechless. Grunts and annoyed gestures every time I ordered - despite the cheery "Hello Darl" when I first walked in. The coffee was slopped everywhere when it crashed down onto the table. The waitress smelt vaguely of beetroot. <b>2/10 </b><br><br></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><h2>Value For Money:</h2><br><b>Jeff:</b> I've been here for a couple of hours now (nice view dontchaknow) and no-one's charged me - I even left to go to the flipflop shop next door and came back and not a word was said (though one of the old folk looked up from their soup and yelled 'Rubarb'). Still, I wouldn't really want to pay anything for the food so <b>5/10.</b><br><br></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><h2>Overall:</h2><br><b>Jeff:</b> I wouldn't come back here even if you poked me with a 10 foot lobster. It's better to sit outside and get a tan and watch the sun going down, turning the sky the colour of beetroot...<br><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><b>FINAL SCORE: 47.5%<br>Well, two and a half stars isn't that bad, really. Unless you're trying to make a living by selling food to people, which, in this case, I suspect isn't their primary goal...<br></b></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><font face="arial, helvetica" size=3><br><br><a href="index1.html">Contents</a></font></td></tr></table></center></body>
