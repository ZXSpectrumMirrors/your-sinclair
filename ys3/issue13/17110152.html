Two radio-controlled robots slug it out in an arena. The first to be immobilised is the loser. It's so simple. It's mechanised boxing. It's such an exciting idea, you'd have to go to quite extraordinary lengths to screw it up. Naturally, the BBC have spared no expense to utterly destroy any enjoyment that might be had from the game.</p></font><font  color="#000000"><p id="normtxt"></p></font><font  color="#000000"><p id="normtxt">It's not that complicated, is it? Two robots, in an arena, duel to death or immobilisation. They have their own individual methods of inflicting damage. Hammers, flippers, saws, drills, axes, and all manner of other novel methods of attempting to inflict damage on opponents have been employed. It's such a straightforward, noble concept. A gentlemen's duel for the honour of victory. How could anyone possibly mess it up?</p></font><font  color="#000000"><p id="normtxt"></p></font><font  color="#000000"><p id="normtxt"></p></font><font  color="#000000"><p id="normtxt"><h3>HOUSE RULES</h3></p></font><font  color="#000000"><p id="normtxt"></p></font><img src="img/matilda.gif" align="left"><font  color="#000000"><p id="normtxt">First, the BBC have no concept of honour. Fearful that a pair of amateur-built robots might not inflict the kind of visceral damage that they believe their audience wants, they added four 'House Robots'. They sit in the corners of the arena, ready to batter, crush, slice and torch any amateur robot that dares to get too close. So, rather than having the two duellists fighting each other, they fight to push each other into a corner, whereupon the loser might as well give up as the House Robots swarm onto their robot and render it immobile.</p></font><font  color="#000000"><p id="normtxt"></p></font><font  color="#000000"><p id="normtxt">This in itself is bad enough, but, fearful that eventually some mere amateur would build a robot that would give their House Robots a good kicking, the BBC decided it would be perfectly alright if they weren't forced to comply with the same rules that the amateurs do. (Later, terrified further by the promise of the utter destruction of even these 'super robots' by mere amateurs, they added 'Sir Killalot', a robot the size of a small child (and several times the weight) with a claw capable of cutting clean through any robot. Inevitably, it was administered a bit of a kicking too.)</p></font><font  color="#000000"><p id="normtxt"></p></font><font  color="#000000"><p id="normtxt">Unsurprisingly, the House Robots take away any sense of real competition. Most battles are ended by the aforementioned Sir Killalot casually picking up one of the competitors and equally-casually dropping them into a hole in the arena floor. (Referred to in-show as 'The Pit', or by the commentator as 'The Pit of Oblivion', 'The Pit of Doom', 'The Pit of Gloom', 'The Pit of Death', 'The Ultimate Abyss', amongst many, many other names.) Most irritating of all is seeing a robot struggling to detach itself from a House Robot, having been rammed into place by its opponent, only to be rushed by every other House Robot in the arena, despite it only being in the corner of one of them, and consequently lose the match, despite having been doing quite well up to that point.</p></font><font  color="#000000"><p id="normtxt"></p></font><font  color="#000000"><p id="normtxt">Strangely, the more capable robots tend not to get rushed. 'Chaos', for example, never, ever got rushed, since the match where it first hurled its opponent out of the arena before going House Robot tipping. (Its builder may be androgynous, but you've got to respect that kind of an attitude.) 'Hypnodisc', the new People's Champion, has never, ever been rushed, given that debris from its opponents is generally swept from the arena after it's done its work. ('Matilda' caught a glancing blow from the first version of 'Hypnodisc' and had her outer shell ripped off.) Were I slightly more confrontational I might wonder aloud whether the operators of robots such as 'Chaos' and 'Hypnodisc' were rewarded for not trashing the House Robots. Oops.</p></font><font  color="#000000"><p id="normtxt"></p></font><img src="img/bash.gif" align="right"><font  color="#000000"><p id="normtxt">Really, if a competitor's robot is so limited in design that its sole method of attack is to push the opponent into somebody more capable of inflicting damage, that robot deserves to receive the severe kicking it would be guaranteed were it not for the likes of 'Sergeant Bash' and 'Matilda'.</p></font><font  color="#000000"><p id="normtxt"></p></font></td></tr></table><table width="100%"><tr><td align="left"></td><td align="right"><p id="normtxt"><a href="17110153.html">Forward&gt;&gt;</a></p></td></tr></table><center><p id="normtxt"><b><a href="index1.html">Back to Contents</a></b></p></center></td></tr></table></center></body>
