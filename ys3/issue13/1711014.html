Or the web at least. Although wasn't Buffy a gratuitous scantily clad girly only a few issues ago? Surely there must be a few more Speccy related temptresses to fill your hallowed pages.<br><br>Oh and I claim a Trainspotter for the obvious mistake on the Next Month page. It's says that Issue 13 will be out in May, which it almost certainly won't be. Probably.<br><br>AndyC<br><br><i>Well... no. No it wasn't. This issue is quite late, although only a month is quite good by our standards. But for your slur against 'too much' Buffy, you're not getting a Trainspotter. Ner.<br></i><br></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><h3>The Internet's Down<br></h3>Dear YS3,<br><br>There appears to be a problem with the Internet - I do not see the latest issue of your magazine until about three years after it is published.  Is there anything you can do to help?<br><br>Regards,<br>Chris<br><br><i>Yes. Send us money, and we'll send you the issue on a floppy disk.<br></i><br></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><h3>In The IT Vendors<br></h3>Hi,<br><br>I had a chance to stop by your website and think it belongs in the IT Vendors Directory I'm currently doing.<br><br>Could you spare a few seconds to submit (at no cost) your company at (<i>"The site I'm spamming for" Ed.</i>) You'll be exposed to qualified IT professionals (not only techies like myself, but also CIOs, CTOs, and other decision making guys).<br><br>If any other person in your company is actually responsible for providing info, would you send me her/his email? (like marketing for example)<br><br>Thank you.<br>Pascal PERRY<br><br><i>Actually, I'm not sure I want to be exposed to anyone, let alone 'qualified IT professionals'.<br></i><br></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><h3>Found Your Lovely<br></h3>Hello!<br><br>I have just found your lovely little site on the internet. Very impressive it is too. Just thught<br>I'd write and let you know as I can't imagine you get that many reasonably attractive females<br>contacting you (of which I am one).<br><br>Anyway, must dash, as I'm at work and abusing the internet when I really should be calculating<br>pension increases. Exciting life eh? Come to think about it, if you need a fit bird to hang around<br>the office and make tea etc, I'm willing to do that if you want. It's got to be more interesting<br>than this job. <br><br>Take Care,<br>Christine (blonde, 21yrs old, 34-26-32, champion at Chaos - always use the gooey blob whilst hiding<br>in a magic tree)<br><br><i>I always go for hurling my blob around at the start of the game (no<br>jokes please), to get a nice spread in the middle- to end-game. Oh, er,<br>you're more than welcome to hang around the YS3 office. Although we<br>won't be able to pay you any money, we'd certainly appreciate someone<br>attractive and female making the drinks.<br><br>Hang on... what do you mean you can't imagine we get that many females<br>contacting us? We can't even go down the shops these days without being<br>mobbed by screaming teenage girls wanting signed photos. We've even got<br>our own fan club - <a href="mailto:blindlyoptimistic@ys3.co.uk">fanclub@ys3.co.uk</a>.<br><br>Tch. Indeed.<br></i><br></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><h3>Paint The Whole World With A Rainbow<br></h3>Sir,<br><br>I claim a Trainspotters Award, for noticing a glaring inaccuracy in your magazine.<br> <br>I have just got back from holiday, and had rather a lot of mail to go through.<br> <br>Anyway, on page 12 Issue 3 March 1986 (<i>Hang on a minute... Ed</i>)there is a grossly misleading advert! I can only conclude that it was an April Fools joke gone wrong. A company supposedly called Micronet800 are advertising - a modem based service including FREE games, FREE e-mail and home shopping. For twenty pence per day. But, the telephone number was clearly wrong 'cos it started 01 not 0171! (<i>Well, that's because... Ed</i>)<br> <br>Undeterred I went to London, clutching my 20p, to the published address (8 Herbal Hill LONDON EC1), only to find a juggling shop! There was a little man inside the shop smoking a 'herbal' cigarette, I told him that I had come about the Spectrum. He took his sunglasses off, laughed manically and said 'Yeah Man, paint the whole world with a rainbow'.<br> <br>So, I deserve an award, or  at least compensation for my wasted journey.<br><br>thx1138<br><br><i>I don't really want to spoil things, but wait until you get to the mail<br>that arrived in September 1993.<br></i><br></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><h3>Blatant Plugging<br></h3>Hi,<br><br>Around 4 weeks ago (<i>More like four months now. Ed</i>)I launched an ezboard called Loaded Spectrum - The Forum and so far I have 114 Members and things are going OK.<br><br>I have just been listed on the Yahoo Spectrum Webring and was wondering if I could ask you a huge favour.<br><br>Could I get a mention or a link in your next online issue?<br><br>It would be appreciated.<br><br>The URL is:<br><br><a href="http://www.loadedspectrumforum.cjb.net">http://www.loadedspectrumforum.cjb.net</a><br><br>Thanks,<br>Host<br>Loaded Spectrum <br><br><i>All you have to do is ask.
