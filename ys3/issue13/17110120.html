We're very honoured...</b></p></font><font  color="#000000"><p id="edtxt"><i>It's entirely my pleasure. Quite terrific. You know, I waited for </i>years<i> for your predecessors to talk to me. They interviewed Mummy once, you know. She was quite annoyed at one of them spilling tea everywhere. But I really don't know why. I was so glad to see you were carrying on their work.</i></p></font><font  color="#000000"><p id="edtxt"><b>You know about the Great Magazine and YS3?</b></p></font><font  color="#000000"><p id="edtxt"><i>Oh, yes of </i>course<i>. Didn't you know?</i></p></font><font  color="#000000"><p id="edtxt"><b>Erm... yes, yes we knew. Yes, no doubt about it. So, you must have a few memories then?</b></p></font><font  color="#000000"><p id="edtxt"><i>I certainly do. The Speccy is quite remarkable. Of course not always reliable, but where's the fun in that? One night I was sitting up late, typing in a program until about three o'clock. I was exhausted. But then, of course, the little bast refused to save to tape, didn't it? Thousands of lines of code for nothing. Oh, of course I ran the program anyway, but it didn't seem to do much.</i></p></font><font  color="#000000"><p id="edtxt"><b>Ah, yes. The good old days.</b></p></font><font  color="#000000"><p id="edtxt"><i>Nowadays I usually stick to The Train Game and other games of that nature.

I was looking forward to that Prince of the Yolkfolk for a long time. But when I bought it, it seemed to consist entirely of an egg with a face sitting in a little cave.

It was the big family game of Christmas Chaos in 1991. It had come down to me, Mummy and Edward. Edward was being boring, hiding in one of those magic castles. Ha! He'll never have the palace! Mummy had conjured up some dire wolves and was pretending they were vicious corgis. They are vicious actually, the little basts. Er… I had run out of spells, but I got that </i>nasty<i> Turmoil spell from a magic wood. I cast it, and Eddie… er, Edward, got trapped between Mummy's corgis, I mean wolves. Then his castle disappeared and he was mauled to death. How I laughed! After that I killed Mummy with my magic sword. I offered her the chance to abdicate from the game, but she clung on as usual. That was a very sweet moment.</i></p></font><font  color="#000000"><p id="edtxt"><b>Ye-es.

He's very insistent when it comes to getting the mag out on time.</b></p></font><font  color="#000000"><p id="edtxt"><i>Well, if you're sure. It was </i>most<i> thrilling to be interviewed for YS3. Thank you.</i></p></font><font  color="#000000"><p id="edtxt"><b>No, thank you, Your Highness. You know, you should drop by for some tea and Toffee Cream Slices sometime. We'll lock Jon up, maybe play some Chaos?</b></p></font><font  color="#000000"><p id="edtxt"><i>I shall make a note of it. It would be a great pleasure. But watch out, I never lose!</i></p></font><font  color="#000000"><p id="edtxt"><b>That's okay. David spends the whole game sulking because everyone disbelieves his vampires, Jamie usually fails to cast anything at all, Nathan dies within the first two turns and Jeff only plays so he can get his name in the mag. (Oi! Jeff) I'm sure you'll put us all to shame.</b></p></font><font  color="#000000"><p id="edtxt"><i>Excellent. I always get what I want in the end, even if I have to wait years for it.</i></p></font><font  color="#000000"><p id="edtxt"><b>Erm, yes.
