Aboard this compact-yet-desirable starship, editor Nathan 'Nat' Cross, having taken a wrong turn while trying to deliver the only disk with the twelfth issue of YS3 on it, was to experience cosmic forces beyond all comprehension.
<br><br>
In a freak mishap, his life support systems were frozen by temperatures beyond imagination.
<br><br>
YS3 was blown out of its planned trajectory into an orbit one thousand times more vast - an orbit which was to return Nat Cross to Earth what seemed like five hundred years later.

<b>FADE IN:</b> <i>Space. Cold, dark space. Cold, dark, unforgiving... (</i>Look, I've warned you before. You've already opened with four paragraphs of padding as it is. If you don't stop this now, I'm going to have to take extreme measures. Jon<i>) Yeah? Like what? (</i>I'll... I'll... I'll eat all the Toffee Cream Slices. Jon<i>) Oh, that'll make such a change, won't it? (</i>Ahem. Jon<i>) In any case, who's telling this story? (</i>You are. Jon<i>) And who's the editor (despite any rumours to the contrary)? (</i>Sassen frassen rassen... Jon<i>) Hurumph. Now, where was I? Oh yes...</i>
<br><br>
<b>CUT TO:</b> <i>Interior of NASA spacecraft. NAT is sitting in the pilot's chair, an A5 piece of paper in his hand. He switches on his radio to contact the pilot of the spaceplane ahead.</i>
<br><br>
<font color="#cfcfff">NAT: So, er... what's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this?</font>
<br><br>
<font color="#ffffcf">RADIO: Wishing she was somewhere else.</font>
<br><br>
<font color="#cfcfff">NAT: Oh? Well, there's plenty of room over here...</font>
<br><br>
<font color="#ffffcf">RADIO: Tempting as it is to open the canopy to my spaceplane and expose my unprotected body to both freezing and depressurisation, I think I'll stay where I am.</font>
<br><br>
<font color="#cfcfff">NAT: Your unprotected body?</font>
<br><br>
<font color="#ffffcf">RADIO: I mean I'm not wearing a spacesuit. For flip's sake...</font>
<br><br>
<font color="#cfcfff">NAT: Erm... Alright then. (Thinks.) So... do you come here often?</font>
<br><br>
<font color="#ffffcf">RADIO: Too often, it seems.</font>
<br><br>
<font color="#cfcfff">NAT: Aah. Not a fan of space, then?</font>
<br><br>
<font color="#ffffcf">RADIO: No, I'm not a fan of your material.</font>
<br><br>
<font color="#cfcfff">NAT: Well, Jon writes most of it, anyway.</font>
<br><br>
<font color="#ffffcf">RADIO: You'd better get ready for final approach. I'll go land on something solid while you hurl yourself into the sea. Somebody'll pick you up and bring you back to headquarters.</font>
<br><br>
<b>FADE TO BLACK.</b>
<br><br>
<b>FADE TO:</b> <i>Earth Space Command Headquarters. NAT is led by a military policeman through the plain white corridors to an office. He enters to see a young, foppish man behind a desk and a cute woman in something vaguely resembling a military uniform but with a much, much shorter skirt.</i>
<br><br>
<font color="#cfffcf">FOPPISH MAN: Ah, you must be Mr Cross. I'm Doctor Hugh. I understand you've already met Colonel Willow?</font>
<br><br>
<font color="#cfcfff">NAT: Not in the flesh, no. And what flesh it is. Who designed that uniform, anyway?</font>
<br><br>
<font color="#ffffcf">WILLOW: A fellow chauvinist of yours, I suspect.</font>
<br><br>
<font color="#cfffcf">HUGH: Erm, yes, well, anyway... um, I understand you've been in space for quite some time?</font>
<br><br>
<font color="#cfcfff">NAT: Mmmm, Colonel Willow...</font>
