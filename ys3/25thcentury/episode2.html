Aboard this compact-yet-desirable starship, editor Nathan 'Nat' Cross, having taken a wrong turn while trying to deliver the only disk with the twelfth issue of YS3 on it, was to experience cosmic forces beyond all comprehension.
<br><br>
In a freak mishap, his life support systems were frozen by temperatures beyond imagination.
<br><br>
YS3 was blown out of its planned trajectory into an orbit one thousand times more vast - an orbit which was to return Nat Cross to Earth what seemed like five hundred years later.

<b>FADE IN:</b> <i>Space. Cold, dark space. Cold, dark, unforgiving... (</i>Oi! This is obvious padding! Jon<i>) Ahem.</i>
<br><br>
<b>CUT TO:</b> <i>Interior of NASA spacecraft. The pilot's chair is vacant. The control console is covered in bits of paper, although slightly less than there were. A pile of screwed-up balls of paper fills one corner. There is the sound of rushing water, and the door at the back of the command room opens.</i>
<br><br>
<font color="#cfcfff">NAT: Well, now I know where that door leads. Although I'm still rather concerned by the presence of Earth-level gravity aboard such a small vessel that is obviously not spinning.</font>
<br><br>
<i>The radio crackles into life.</i>
<br><br>
<font color="#ffffcf">RADIO: Attention unidentified vessel - identify yourself at once.</font>
<br><br>
<i>NAT scrambles into his chair and puts on the radio headset. Looking out of the window he can see a sleek aeroplane-like spacecraft.</i>
<br><br>
<font color="#cfcfff">NAT: Blimey. Since this tin can is covered in well-known identifying marks, they can't be from Earth. They must be aliens. And they might have guns. Erm... (Switches on radio) Greetings! I am Nat'an C'hross, powerful transdimensional god turned peaceful space explorer and pronouncer of unpronouncable punctuation. Although I am entirely capable of destroying you utterly, I shall refrain from doing so because I am an ethical god.</font>
<br><br>
<font color="#ffffcf">RADIO: This is Colonel Willow Moosing of Earth Space Fleet. If you're a powerful transdimensional god, why are you travelling in a NASA satellite monitoring pod?</font>
<br><br>
<font color="#cfcfff">NAT: Er... I'm on holiday.</font>
<br><br>
<font color="#ffffcf">RADIO: I don't believe you're a god at all. I think you're lying.</font>
<br><br>
<font color="#cfcfff">NAT: Alright, I'm lying. I'm really an internet journalist.</font>
<br><br>
<font color="#ffffcf">RADIO: Stop it. We'll lead you down to Earth and find out who you really are.</font>
<br><br>
<font color="#cfcfff">NAT: Well, I'm headed for Earth anyway, and you sound like a nice girl... It's a date.</font>
<br><br>
<font color="#ffffcf">RADIO: Follow my fighter and I'll lead you to a runway.</font>
<br><br>
<font color="#cfcfff">NAT: Make it a lake and I'm all yours.</font>
<br><br>
<i>Casting aside enough paper to get at the flight stick, NAT carefully modifies his flight path to point at the spaceplane ahead. With still so far left before Earth, he had plenty of time to think about what had happened. Since when did NASA have proper spaceplanes? How long had he been away? What fantastic new technologies would exist on the Earth of the future? And which piece of paper had the emergency chat-up lines on?</i>
