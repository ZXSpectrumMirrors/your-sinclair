Aboard this compact-yet-desirable starship, editor Nathan 'Nat' Cross, having taken a wrong turn while trying to deliver the only disk with the twelfth issue of YS3 on it, was to experience cosmic forces beyond all comprehension.
<br><br>
In a freak mishap, his life support systems were frozen by temperatures beyond imagination.
<br><br>
YS3 was blown out of its planned trajectory into an orbit one thousand times more vast - an orbit which was to return Nat Cross to Earth what seemed like five hundred years later.

<font color="#cfffcf">HUGH: Now, look, that's enough of that chaps. Honestly. Now, Mr Cross, it seems that when you left Earth, you took with you the only copy of Issue Twelve of YS3.</font>
<br><br>
<font color="#cfcfff">NAT: Lawks, I'd forgotten about that. Well, I took everybody's work and my scraps of paper. Does that count?</font>
<br><br>
<font color="#cfffcf">HUGH: Mm, close enough. What we really want to know is - have you finished it?</font>
<br><br>
<font color="#cfcfff">NAT: No.</font>
<br><br>
<font color="#7fcf3f">HUGH and WILLOW: WHAT?!</font>
<br><br>
<font color="#cfcfff">NAT: Only joshing. Of course I've finished it. You'd be rather annoyed at having read through almost four whole episodes of this nonsense only to discover that Issue Twelve still wasn't ready, wouldn't you?</font>
<br><br>
<font color="#cfffcf">HUGH: Rather, yes. So, where is it then?</font>
<br><br>
<font color="#cfcfff">NAT: It's in my spaceship.</font>
<br><br>
<font color="#ffffcf">WILLOW: The one that you ditched in the Atlantic?</font>
<br><br>
<font color="#cfcfff">NAT: That's the one. You did recover it, didn't you?</font>
<br><br>
<font color="#ffffcf">WILLOW: Oh... crivens.</font>
<br><br>
<font color="#cfffcf">HUGH: Well, colonel, it looks like you're going to have to go down for us. You'd best fetch your snorkel.</font>
