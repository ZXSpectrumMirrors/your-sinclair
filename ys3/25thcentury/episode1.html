Aboard this compact-yet-desirable starship, editor Nathan 'Nat' Cross, having taken a wrong turn while trying to deliver the only disk with the twelfth issue of YS3 on it, was to experience cosmic forces beyond all comprehension.
<br><br>
In a freak mishap, his life support systems were frozen by temperatures beyond imagination.
<br><br>
YS3 was blown out of its planned trajectory into an orbit one thousand times more vast - an orbit which was to return Nat Cross to Earth what seemed like five hundred years later.

<b>FADE IN:</b> <i>Space. Cold, dark space. Cold, dark, unforgiving space.</i>
<br><br>
<i>Icy, pitch black, treacherous space. Nothing but vacuum for billions of miles.</i>
<br><br>
<i>Chill, dread, nightmarish space, where the endless nothing can swallow up a man without a trace. The endless frontier, where anything is possible (on a quantum level, at any rate); where men are men and women are women, although they could be evil shapeshifting aliens ready to suck your brains out through your... </i>
<br><br>
<i>But wait! What is this, drifting on camera, wobbling gently from side to side despite the stage-hand's best efforts to keep the string still?</i>
<br><br>
<b>CLOSE UP:</b> <i>Typical NASA knock-off - tin cylinder with big solar panels. This one is covered in what is obviously fake snow. As it draws closer to the sun, the string wobbles a little more and the snow falls off.</i>
<br><br>
<b>CUT TO:</b> <i>Interior of spacecraft. Sitting in the single pilot's chair is a sleeping man. Covering the control console is an astonishingly large array of scraps of paper, torn from note-books, briefing documents from various companies and assorted NASA reference manuals. Scrawled across each is a series of unintelligible notes. The visible mechanics of the console consist of a Quickjoy joystick and a +D floppy drive (with disk). The pilot slowly awakens.</i>

<br><br>
<i>NAT looks drowsily around for a few seconds and yawns before noticing the view from the window. Earth is clearly visible, but is very, very, very small. NAT snaps awake. He opens his mouth to utter an expletive, but then luckily remembers that he's not as big a deal as to justify an uncut rerun at a later date, and decides not to bother, since it'll only cause editing problems. Instead he begins to hurriedly clear the control console before him by carefully sweeping all the paper onto the floor with his arm. His keen eyes scan the various displays for something useful, and after a few frantic seconds he finds the one he's looking for.</i>

<br><br>
<i>Setting his chin stoically, NAT prepares himself for his long-awaited return to Earth; his steely gaze not revealing the whirlwind of thoughts in his head. For instance, why wasn't he out of oxygen? Why had the paper fallen to the floor? And where did that mysterious door behind him lead to, anyway? Instead we...</i>
