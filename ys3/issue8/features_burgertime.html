After the rather creative outings for Burger Time over the past couple of months, Nathan and Jon thought it was time to get down and do some proper work again. Jon caught the <i>YS3</i> private jet back from Oxford, and reunited they set out for the nearest burger bar. Unfortunately, they had already reviewed <i>McDonalds</i> and <i>Burger King</i>, and neither of them knew where <i>KFC</i> or <i>Wimpy</i> are in Bristol… but fear not! Just as all seemed lost, Jon's extended period of time in California before issue one of <i>YS3</i> (doing, er… research) suddenly saved the day. "Let's get a coffee!" he suggested. Nathan regarded him quizzically whilst Jon explained all about the newest, hippest, happeninest past time of the young and carefree: coffee bars, magical establishments where good (non-alcoholic) beverages and a fine selection of pastries are married with impeccable décor and remarkable choice. Convinced to try this newest craze, Nathan followed Jon to that most famous of coffee bars, <i>Starbucks</i>, recently set up in every major city cross the country in some kind of pleasant invasion plan. Stopping only to muck around on a sofa next to a fountain and a lamp stand with a couple of umbrellas, they descended upon <i>Starbucks</i>, notepads and wallets at the ready...
<br><br>
<b>How Does It Work?</b><br>
Nathan and Jon order a drink each at the Drinking Place. Nathan orders whatever takes his fancy, and Jon gets a risk-free beverage of much repute. While Nathan is sipping his chosen beverage and Jon is stirring his whilst trying to look chic, questions are posed on six sections of the Place:
<ol>
<li><b>Ambiance:</b> how pleasant is the atmosphere in the establishment? Does it make you feel like humming a certain theme tune by <i>The Rembrandts</i> or begin to cry uncontrollably into your coffee?</li>
<li><b>Consumables Quality:</b> fairly self-explanatory - how nice are the food and drinks on offer? Do you rush to the counter, begging for more or would you prefer hunger and thirst?</li>
<li><b>Positive Contribution To Your Day:</b> Nathan and Jon realised within seconds that <i>Starbucks</i> doesn't actually have any TV advertising. So, after much coffee and brain-storming, they decided on this new category. Do you feel lifted after a visit, or do you find yourself walking under buses and touching live electrical wires after leaving the store?</li>
<li><b>Staff:</b> how friendly are the staff? Are they more depressed than you or do they brighten your day? Are their sentences so pre-programmed they get a general protection fault, or are they as natural as natural yogurt?</li>
<li><b>Value For Money:</b> how do the prices compare with other such establishments? Are you paying through the nose or saving millions?</li>
<li><b>Overall:</b> The overall impression and enjoyment factor.</li>
</ol>

<br><br>		
<b>Consumables Quality:</b><br>
<i>Jon:</i> Man, that's a good cup of coffee, and the muffins rock. <b>9/10</b><br>

<br><br>		
<b>Positive Contribution To Your Day:</b><br>
<i>Jon:</i> I got to see an old friend again, which was nice… (looks around thoughtfully) to quote <i>Frasier</i> once more, "I'm pumped, I'm psyched, and I'm pretty sure I just swallowed and entire twist of lemon!" Only I didn't swallow the lemon, obviously. <b>7/10</b><br>

Starbucks Total: 80%<br>
Oh my goodness, it's a stunning result for the new import on the block, and all of those points were well-merited. It's pretty expensive, yes, but there's much quality to be enjoyed with the quantity of money it costs and the staff are an example to all food and drink establishments, a shining beacon, all alone in the night.
