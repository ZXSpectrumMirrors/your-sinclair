<b>Joystick Jugglers</b>

<b>Nathan Cross</b>
<br><br>
<font size=1>
After a few brief months' respite from serious problems with his computer, Nathan decided it would be a good idea to install Windows 98. He did first copy his Netscape folder, with all his mail, address books, a variety of articles written by the team, and a vast selection of quality reader mail to a backup folder on a separate drive before reformatting and installing the 'new' 'operating system'. Unfortunately, Windows subsequently denied all knowledge of the backup, and so YS3 is, once again, spectacularly late. (But still not as late as issue four.)

<b>Jon Hyde</b>
<br><br>
<font size=1>
Jon decided to turn his keyboard and mouse in for a waiter’s cloth this month, to try and really get into the spirit of the features he would be writing. Unfortunately his white mouse died on the way to the pet shop, so he couldn’t get any money for it… but a quick bit of lateral thinking got him the white waiter’s cloth free of charge. He set up his own pub in Broadmead, down some steps just off the main road. The staple diet of gentle alcoholics, know-it-all postmen, gorgeous yet emotionally unstable barmaids, stable but bitingly sarcastic barmaids and neurotic psychiatrists soon made Jon’s bar (or “Beers” as he named it) the happenin’ place to be every weekday evening at 9pm.

<b>Jamie Percival</b>
<br><br>
<font size=1>
This month saw yet another truly remarkable (and unlikely) turn in Jamie’s fortunes. On Tuesday morning he received a note from the Pentagon, recalling him into active service because aliens from the planet Abydos were causing mischief again. Taking some of Jon’s wages to hire his military costume and AK-47 attack rifle, he leapt onto the first plane for Area 51 to join the team of SG-3 on the top-secret Stargate project. Risking life and limb every week to keep us mere mortals safe from the evil Goa’uld, the remaining team of YS3 are warmed to receive a postcard from each planet he visits, usually slightly charred around the edges. Now the galaxy will finally be safe from that ancient evil from Z’ha’dum, the Shadows. No, wait, that’s not right…

<b>David Raven</b>
<br><br>
<font size=1>
New bug David was greeted with much enthusiasm. 'Hurrah!' shouted Nathan, 'Now I can offload all of those terribly unpleasant tasks, like Pssst!' Jon, too, was quite pleased. 'Hurrah!' he bellowed, 'Now I can offload all of those terribly menial jobs, like reviews!' On a similar vein, Jamie was greatly excited. And so the entire magazine was left to David. Unfortunately, nobody remembered to give him the keys to the office, and so we were all forced to do some work ourselves (otherwise this issue would have been even more late). Still, while sitting on the doorstep and waiting to be let in, David did manage to start an in-depth series on the whole legal side of the emulatory 'business', so that filled up a couple of pages.
