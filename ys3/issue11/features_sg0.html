<img src="img/sg1.gif" width="256" height="192" align="right">With the Olympics in Australia this year, Nathan decided that it was time the <i>YS3</i> team got some exercise, too. He ordered everyone on a marathon to the Isle of Man, but before he could grab his own sweat bands and lycra shorts, Jon approached him with an alternative. What, he suggested, if they could bring the spirit of sport to <i>YS3</i> without stepping outside of the office or having to breathe any fresh air? Intrigued, Nathan put his bottle of cola down and listened. The plan was outlined, that they would play through <i>Summer Games</i> on the Speccy, writing their exploits down for their beloved readers the world over. This way there would no longer be any need to watch BBC 1, or travel to Australia to view the Olympics first-hand. This Herculean feast of sporting excitement, conducted entirely on the Speccy, would eclipse it and provide one of issue 11’s features to boot. Leaving everyone else to reach the Isle of Man with only a moped between them, the office door was locked and the real sports began.
<br><br>
Ladies and gentlemen, <i>YS3</i> now proudly invites you to what is - without hyperbole - the most important sporting event of the millennium. The battle between the world’s two most powerful nations - Norway, represented by Nathan, and Epyx, represented by Jon - would be settled on the fields of the <i>Summer Games</i>, and the eternal and ultimate champion decided in the eight events from which it is made up. The torch has been lit, the birds have flown… ladies and gentlemen, to the fields!
