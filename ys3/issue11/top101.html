Technically, this should really be the final week of the <i>Top 101</i> feature… but in order to stretch it out for as long as possible and thus avoid having to come up with any new ideas, it’s going to do two issues more! This month we proudly present the 100th-best thing to do whilst waiting for your Speccy load, followed next month by the final instalment, the long-awaited number 101. Which will give Jon another few weeks to come up with it. Ladies and gentlemen, drum roll, please.

<ol start=100>
<li>Compose a few lines of rhyming verse or a limerick about something or the other, exercising those creative gifts that we all have. An example, just to get you thinking, might be:<br><br>
“<i>I’m the proud owner of a Spectrum,<br>
It’s definitely my favourite chum</i>”<br><br>
Or even (still talking about me and the Spectrum, thank you very much):<br>
“<i>We spend many happy hours together,<br>
Though neither of us wears any leather.</i>”<br><br>
And perhaps a limerick might go something like:<br>
“<i>A young man once stood in a queue,<br>
in quite desperate need of the loo.<br>
He was standing in line,<br>
But lost track of the time,<br>
And I hope it won’t happen to you.</i>”<br><br>
Perhaps we’ll even print a few of the funny or interesting ones in later issues, dishing out prizes where appropriate. But please don’t make them too vulgar; Bob might be hard as nails when it comes to guns and people, but he really has a soft spot for verse and wouldn’t like it. And then there would be Armageddon of Biblical proportions.<br><br></li>
