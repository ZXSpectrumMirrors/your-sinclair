<h2>Event 5 - Gymnastics</h2>
<p id="normtxt">The gymnast jogs onto the screen, bounds off the spring board onto the vaulting horse and has to pull off some neat moves on the way back down to get as many points as possible from the judges. Each contestant has two chances, and Nathan took to the horse first.</p>

		</td>
		<td>
<p id="normtxt">After some squabbling over the controls, Nathan went out first, falling over the spring board and missing the horse altogether. However, the one fault did not stop him recovering to earn a fair few points, almost finishing on his feet once. Almost. But that’s more than Jon managed, as every bound ended up with the gymnast sprawled on her face and a pretty low score from the judges. The judges have very little quality to choose from, but Nathan’s almost-standing tips the balance, and he leaves with gold once more.</p>

<h2>Event 6 - 400m Freestyle</h2>
<p id="normtxt">With Epyx desperately in need of a break, the action turns to the swimming pool for 400m of swimming shenanigans. Once again, the gold goes to the first one to finish the 400m necessary. Can Jon repeat the miraculous (and so very close) win of the 400m relay, or will Nathan once again grab the shiniest medal?</p>

		</td>
		<td>
<p id="normtxt">A couple of false starts, and the two swimmers leap into the water like people who knew how to swim. Legs and arms going for all they’re worth, the first lap was pretty close, with Nathan just edging into the lead. When they hit the other side of the pool, Jon vanished from sight as Nathan sped away back up the lane. Was it over already? Would Norway trounce Epyx so easily? But just as all seemed lost, Jon suddenly resurfaced a few feet ahead of Nathan, having sped past him underwater after turning around. Repeating this for each lap, Jon quite comfortably finished a good few seconds before his nemesis.</p>

<h2>Event 7 - 100m Freestyle</h2>
<p id="normtxt">Following the spectacular change of fortune in the last event, Jon was thrilled to return to the swimming pool for the penultimate race. 100m was all that was required, but Nathan had quite effortlessly shown himself king in this event on dry land. Could the tables be turned in the water?</p>

		</td>
		<td>
<p id="normtxt">The two leapt into the pool together, and seemed almost even all the way to the end of the pool, and the first half. As in the last event, they both went under to change direction, but Jon did not surface as Nathan sped back to the finish. More time passed, and still Jon was nowhere to be seen. Had he finally drowned after his extended underwater escapades? Was Nathan going to secure Norway’s victory over Jon’s dead body, as they had joked at the beginning? Nathan did not look back as he pressed relentlessly onto the finish, only to see Jon once again surface a few feet in front of him to take another event for Epyx. Needless to say, accusations of cheating were raised at the end, but the judges decreed Jon’s mutant power of extended underwater breathing was legitimate.</p>

<h2>Event 8 - Skeet Shoot</h2>
<p id="normtxt">The final event - the results of which would decide the winner of the whole games - finally arrived, shotguns and all. The aim was simple: shoot as many clay pigeons as possible, the person with the highest number of hits winning glory, gold and his nation’s ultimate and eternal victory over the other.</p>

		Ignoring the skeets, Jon aims for an innocent hyena on a remote mountain ridge. He really didn’t like them in <i>The Lion King</i>.</p>
		</td>
		<td>
<p id="normtxt">Nathan took up the gun first, and proceeded to hit every single skeet with a precision and accuracy that Robocop could only dream about. Needless to say, when he put the gun down with a perfect score sheet, the stadium was united in its awed hush. Could Jon match this perfect turn-out, and, if he could, how could he tip the balance in his favour? Nervously he took the shotgun, and after a slightly rocky start, found his rhythm, matching Nathan shot for shot. The whole crowd waited on a breath as Jon somehow managed to get every skeet, and no-one dared move as the final score was tallied.</p>
</td>
</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
<p id="normtxt">And it was decided. In a controversial decision that Nathan vehemently disputes to this day, Jon hit one more target than his competitor, securing the games for Epyx, once and for all. It looked like 100% wasn’t good enough for Norway, who left with a nice shiny silver medal in their pockets and profanities on their lips. Epyx, meanwhile, through methods dubious and suspect, had secured gold and glory for themselves forever. Let’s hope it was worth it.</p>
