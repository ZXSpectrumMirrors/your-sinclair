<font face="arial, helvetica" size=1>This is not T'ai Chi Tortoise. Obviously. It's just that we're crap at finding obscure screenshots. But what else would you expect from the second crappiest Speccy mag ever (in a funky skillo kind of way, natch)?</font>

Tortoises, when you think about them (if you ever do) are pretty crap creatures. Slow, boring and prone to being trampled on. And if you’re a Pratchett follower, you may believe the tale of eagles who take the tortoise for a high ride... before letting it go, with predictable results.
<br><br>
All of this is to serve merely as an introduction so I can say ‘But..!’. Y’see, T’ai Chi Tortoise was most certainly not crap. You knew that, didn’t you? If I said, actually T’ai Chi Tortoise was crap as well, there wouldn’t be much point in seeing where he is now, would there? (<i>No, but it'd make this article a lot quicker to edit. Ed</i>) Am I wibbling too much? (<i>Well, I didn't like to say anything, but... yes. Ed</i>) Oops, sorry. (<i>Really, don't mention it. It happens to the best of us. Ed</i>) Ahem. Shall I carry on now? (<i>Let's! Ed</i>)

T’ai Chi’s (in fact, let’s call him TC, not to be confused with the crap and overrated cat with those initials) biggest problem during his almost-glory days was always having to explain what the hell T’ai Chi actually is. Never, he always complained, did anyone notice what he really did. His jump-around-a-bit-and-collect-em-up game attracted a small band of followers, but was most often found somewhere near the bottom of 50p bargain basement buckets. Hey, look at that alliteration! Isn’t that cool? I bet Nathan doesn’t notice that, readers. (<i>Of course not. I only read every third line. Ed</i>)
<br><br>
TC, once a role model for his ridiculously crap species, lives a much more leisurely life these days. Disgusted by the lack of a contract offer to make a sequel to his game, he decided to retire to grow vegetables on his allotment. Now 132, and still going strong, TC still practices T’ai Chi, and still bemoans the lack of a certain prestigious Megagame award by a magazine that sold the occasional copy a few years back. Now what was it called again..?
<br><br>
TC has had his fifteen minutes of fame, and so becomes the latest in a long line of former Speccy stars who have drifted away, almost forgotten. TC, <i>YS3</i> salutes you and wishes you a long and happy retirement. May your cabbages never go yellow. Or something.
