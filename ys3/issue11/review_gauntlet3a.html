Three by name, three by nature: it’s in 3D! Three dimensions, I tell you! Of course, the facetious might argue that all the <i>Gauntlet</i> games had to be in three dimensions to exist in this reality, but this one really is! Isometric, and everything. Gone are the days of the sketchy overhead dungeon and the funny-looking people running around flat mazes; with its third incarnation <i>Gauntlet</i> gets up close and personal.

The most striking thing to, well, strike you, is the graphics. Pretty sizeable sprites leg it around with disarming ease, quite easily filling the screen and without a hint of slow-down. There are trees, bridges, tombstones, buildings… the landscape is veritably a-clutter with stuff compared to the graphically sparse previous games, and those sprites that there are, are on a totally different scale of size from before also. Ghosts float menacingly towards you, blokes with clubs pile at you, waving the oversized sticks in question, lobbers lunge, Death floats… it all makes you feel right there in the midst of things, removing the safe distance created by the overhead perspective of before. It’s also nice to run around areas which have more than walls and the occasional flashing panel for décor. There’s plenty of real scenery here, and it all consequently feels more inhabited than in the past, like people could have lived there once. Well, the first level does anyway, though the quality seems to deteriorate from there… but we’ll move onto the critiques soon enough. We’re doing positive things now. Think positive. Positive… oh, yes: there’s still a fair bit of weapon-slinging and baddy-basing. Generators chuck out monsters, you chuck your weapon, they die. Then more come, so you knacker the generator and move on. It’s a classic formula, clearly unforsaken in the third game as much as in the first two. OK, still on the positive… struggling a bit now… the sound FX for monsters coming out of the generators is still that funky one from before. And, well, I suppose the change in focus from straight arcade-bash was a nice idea.
