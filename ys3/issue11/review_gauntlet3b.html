Yup, you read it right: the change in focus <b>from</b> straight arcade-bash. For arcade-bash is it no longer. The generators are too few and too spread apart for that, and there’s the collecty-bits. Indeed, the focus of each level is to grab a number of items and take them somewhere. On the first level you eventually stumble across a bucket, which needs to go to the well. There it becomes (or you find, not sure which) a cross, which you need to take to an altar. Take it to the altar and you get something else, which needs to go to the drawbridge… the game is quite explicit in its instructions, and to be fair the locations are pretty obvious. Then on level two you find yourself collecting some keys, and so on. And this basically “is” the game: fight your way to various items. Of course, “fight” is a bit too strong, since you are never even threatened with being overwhelmed, so let’s rephrase… “kill a few baddies” works. And that’s yer lot. Why get the items? To finish the level. Any reason why those items? Only that the programmers fancied it. Why take the bucket to the well? Why collect the keys? WHY?! Even the cliché of someone asking for them would have been nice, but no, just listen to Mr. Game and his bizarre requests for items and you’ll be fine.

And to be honest there would be nothing really wrong with that. Having only the barest of motivations can be acceptable if the beating of the baddies and the getting of the items is suitably exciting. Ah, but that doesn’t work here because that’s dead boring. Wander here, pick something up, wander over there, kill a few baddies (or run away)… and repeat. Again. And again. And, believe it or not, again. Dagnabbit. The originals were so much fun because they were classic action fodder: run around, kill unbelievable numbers of baddies, get some power-ups; it was all so quick, hardly giving you time to breathe, and therein was the fun. <i>Gauntlet III</i>’s rather more pedestrian approach does it no favours in the action department, and the item-gathering is too inane to be of much use either.

On top of that you can throw some isometric oddities (yup, got those, too): some ankle-high bushes stop you in your tracks and some don’t; ghosts can’t float over knee-high objects, and hitting generators can be more entertaining that you ever thought possible with those classic isometric 1°-off attacks. Plus there’s only ever one type of baddie in any particular area, plus double-fire is use potion (an event punishable by capital means in the <i>YS3</i> office), plus thrown weapons still mysteriously appear an inch in front of your person (fine when the view was much further out), plus (for the first time in a <i>Gauntlet</i> game) the two-player mode adds almost nothing… and a number of other little things that don’t really need mentioning because you’ve seen the verdict coming for the last few hundred words. In fact, you’re probably thinking that <i>Gauntlet III</i> tries to be exciting arcade bash and engrossing mini-RPG, and is rather poor because it fails to do either properly. And you’d be right.
