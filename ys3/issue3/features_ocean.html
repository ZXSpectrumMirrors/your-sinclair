One of the Speccy's biggest game publishers, Ocean made their name
converting movie titles to everyone's favourite home computer (which, if
you're an Amstrad, Commodore, Amiga or Atari user, is the Spectrum). There was
a time when every top Hollywood flick got the Ocean treatment and was released
on tape so that the video gaming masses could copy their screen
heroes'ílatest, well, heroic, escapades for themselves. The only thing better
than watching a movie is actually taking part in it yourself; although this
became the catchphrase of the Interactive Movie‘, the philosophy was Ocean's
defining mission statement for many a blockbusting flick. However, the journey
from big screen film reel to home computer tape is fraught with all kinds of
dangers (usually those involving lots and lots of platforms) and the games
themselves often fared poorly as pieces of videogaming history compared to
those written solely for the format.

Nowadays, with the modern home computer pushing the 3D-accelerated 500Mhz
barrier, one would think that the movie itself could be re-produced on the
computer (as they are with DVDs), but the realisations often receive the same
lukewarm reviews and criticisms of their eight-bit ancestors. Generic, say the
reviewers, uninspired tosh released to cash in on the movie. <I>Men In
Black</I>, <I>Disney's Hercules</I>, <I>Independence Day</I>, <I>Star Wars:
The Phantom Menace</I>... the contemporary list goes on. Such is the popular
mistrust imbued in any game named after a film that punters and critics alike
are naturally suspicious, and with reason: aside from <I>Die Hard Trilogy</I>,
can anyone name a good game of a film in the past five years? Indeed, computer
game companies have gone full circle it would seem, now releasing games on
their own ideas, or games based around a successful franchise such as the
<I>Star Wars</I> series of software, or even making their own movies inside a
game. Probably the most successful realisation of this was Origin's <I>Wing
Commander III - Prophecy</I> games on the PC, yet probably no sci-fi fan would
watch them in preference to J. Michael Straczynski's <I>Babylon 5</I> series
or <I>Star Trek: First Contact</I>.

But what were things like way back in the beginning when Ocean were releasing
conversions of movies for the Speccy, having to rely on innovative design and
careful programming rather then FMV cutscenes and big stars to capture the
feel of your favourite movie? Were reviewers being unrealistic, expecting the
magic of filmed Hollywood to be perfectly copied on the Spectrum and other
formats with such limited technology? Personally, I would argue that cunningly
designed games can capture the essence of what makes a good action movie -
involving plot, neat set-pieces, character interaction and drama, obstacles to
overcome - without needing today's PIII 500 technology. Yet it's never easy to
find the creative impulse to realise this, so the end result is often generic,
the simplest route to kind-of-follow the film's plot taken, dropping the set
pieces and character interaction that help make them. But people have already
written volumes on what makes a bad game of a film in game design terms - take
your pick from any Your Sinclair review of a game of a film. No, what we're
going to have a look at now is how close the games themselves come to
capturing the feel and identity of the original film. I've taken a few Ocean
film games - <I>Batman</I>, <I>Highlander</I>, <I>Robocop</I>, <I>Total Recall</I>, <I>Top
Gun</I> and <I>The Untouchables</I> - and I'll take a look at how true they are to the
feel and character of the original movies, to what the extent the soul of the
movie can be found in the game. So, if you feel ready grab a bag of popcorn
and a tall Coca Cola over ice as we dim the lights at the YS3 screening room
and start the films...

<B><I>Batman</I></B><BR>
<BR><B>Who's in it?</B> Michael Keaton, Kim Basinger, Jack Nicholson.
<BR><B>What's it about?</B> Our favourite, mysterious, hard-as-nails Caped
Crusader‘ swoops from the shadows to stop the deliciously evil Joker and steal
the girl's heart.
<BR><B>So what's the feel?</B> Moody, dark... in short, black as the
starless night.
<BR><B>And what's the game like?</B> Itís not exactly a platform game,
which is good. Of the five levels, the first and last are spent wandering
around huge expanses in a not-very-Batman-like way of getting lost, shot and
blown up, all in plain view; so stuff the film's essential shadows and
skullduggery atmosphere and the wonderful interplay between the Joker and
Batman. However, the driving level in the Batmobile and the flying level in
the Batwing fare much better as you belt around Gotham City and the middle
level's solve-the-Smilex-gas puzzle is almost right out of the film... except
for the time limit. And at least all the sections are rememberable from the
film. All in all, not too bad.

<B><I>Highlander</I></B><BR>
<BR><B>Who's in it?</B> Christopher Lambert, Sean Connery
<BR><B>What's it about?</B> Apparently there are immortals among us, those
who can only be killed by decapitation and with one goal in life: to kill
every other immortal in order to receive the ìQuickeningî. Christopher Lambert
is one such chap, who the film follows through a series of quite coherent
flashbacks to his eventual victory as the only immortal left standing.
<BR><B>So what's the feel?</B> An epic battle which spans the ages, with the
tension that all immortals are involved whether they like it or not, even to
the extent of having to kill their friends... it's all kind of mauve.
<BR><B>And what's the game like?</B> The angle taken is of the
one-on-one beatíem up which ignores the character of the film, but is fine if
properly realised with a six-button pad. Yes: oh, dear. In reality, two huge
and horribly pixellated sprites lollop across the sparse screen, each armed
with a sword (or a giant twiglet) and an embarrassing lack of moves, to try
and kill the other. As theyíre immortal, mere blows do not harm and yet
they're so difficult to pull off that you'll never do more than one move every
minute or so AND there seems to be no decapitation move. So these battles
could carry on... forever. Yikes.

<B><I>Robocop</I></B><BR>
<BR><B>Who's in it?</B> Peter Weller, Nancy Allen, Ronny Cox
<BR><B>What's it about?</B>In the cities of the future criminals run riot,
gunning down cops for a past-time. Alex Murphy, their latest victim, has
what's left of him joined with some bits of tough metal and made into Robocop.
However, his past gradually seeps back and he heads off after the men
responsible for his (sort of) death, uncovering corruption at the highest
levels of OCP, the company who built him.
 <BR><B>So what's the feel?</B> Moody, dark, and violent in the extreme.
<BR><B>And what's the game like?</B>As Robocop you go around shooting
everyone, like he does in the film, but without the human psychology/identity
stuff in between the outbursts of violence. Robocop's a good bit more
vulnerable in the game, but he still feels rock hard as bullets slice through
the opposion and almost bounce off him. It all feels mighty close to really
having been in the movie (complete with Prime Directives and scrolly text with
flasing cursors) and incorporates a fair few of its scenes in order in the
(non-platforming) levels, and even has a photo-fit bit to add variety.

<B><I>Total Recall</I></B><BR>
<BR><B>Who's in it?</B> Arnold Schwartzenegger, Sharon Stone, Michael
Ironside
<BR><B>What's it about?</B> A very good question... I think it's something to do
with a bloke who goes for a virtual holiday as a spy to find it coming true...
or is it? Anyway, suffice to say lots of people die as Arnie tries to uncover
the truth on Mars in a rather-less-subtle-than-Bond kind of a way.
<BR><B>So what's the feel?</B> Dark, derelict, violent, confusing... in short, Bond meets Twin
Peaks in the city from Blade Runner.
<BR><B>And what's the game like?</B> Mostly, it's a
platform game as you control a comically-Arnie-esque sprite running around
hugely complicated levels finding items, dispatching baddies and hitting
coloured switches to control the coloured block lying around the place. Itís
stuffed to the gills with that classic: 'Oh, yes, I remember this from the
movie' (expressed sarcastically with a really quizzicle expression) line as
you soon realise this could be any game and, you secretly hope, is not really
the only one you'll get for the supremely intriguing, cunning and violent
film. Flashback, although with a slightly different plot, did it so much
better.

<B><I>Top Gun</I></B><BR>
<BR><B>Who's in it?</B> Tom Cruise, Anthony Edwards, Val Kilmer
<BR><B>What's it about?</B> Some say the ultimate boys' film (though girls go
for the half-naked handsome blokes); Maverick trying to get into the Top Gun
elite flight school is a great excuse for some really cool F-14 dogfights,
gorgeous guys and gals and macho head-banging.
<BR><B>So what's the feel?</B> Brash, tanned, adrenaline-pumped
tosh... in short, Baywatch with planes.
<BR><B>And what's the game like?</B> Well, I couldn't actually get past the
'Select Controls' screen as all button presses ended in defining keys. I still
included it here as the button-pressing was good training for finding them on
the keyboard and learning plane terms such as climb, bank left etc. and the
film's about a plane training school. And the title music and font really felt
like the movie.

<B><I>The Untouchables</I></B><BR>
<BR><B>Who's in it?</B> Kevin Costner, Sean Connery, Robert DeNiro
<BR><B>What's it about?</B> In mob-ruled America of the '30s, Elliot Ness and
his band of gun-toting mates decide that enough is enough and stand up to Al
Capone and his empire of crime. Much gun-toting action results in quite
possibly the classic tale of the good guys standing up to organised evil.
<BR><B>So what's the feel?</B> Gritty, realistic, physchological... in short, Unforgiven in
the thirties.
<BR><B>And what's the game like?</B> Jumping is the image stuck in my mind;
jumping like a jackrabbit with a pin up its bottom to avoid the merciless
hoardes while being shot lots and shooting them lots. As with the film thereís
lots of baddies, and the graphics are black and white (so they feel '30s) but
the music sounds to have been taken from a Charlie Chaplin movie so it feels
like some kind of bizarre comedy.
