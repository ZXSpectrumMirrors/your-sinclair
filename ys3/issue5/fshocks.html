<b>Willytron</b><br><br>
Probably not the official title, but this just about sums up this as-yet-unnamed game by John Dow. The man capable of coding whole games in mere weeks has produced what looks to be the combination of two totally unrelated games; <i>Manic Miner</i> and <i>Robotron</i>. This one we look forward to with great anticipation. Even Nathan, who's a bit of a girl when it comes to hard games (<i>You're fired! Ed.</i>).<br><br>

<b>Horace Trilogy</b><br><br>
Dominic Cresswell's planned masterpiece, this will be a remake of what are apparently episodes four to six of the Horace Saga. He's currently looking for a coder, so if you can code, go offer now, because we really want to play <i>Horace Goes Skiing</i> in three-player mode.<br><br>

<b>Ant Attack 2000</b><br><br>
This promises to be the greatest game that ever saw the light of day. Simultaneous four-player mode, cities the size of, well, cities, and realtime lighting. Already it looks gorgeous, and work has barely even begun. (<i>Cheers, here's that fiver. Ed.</i>)
