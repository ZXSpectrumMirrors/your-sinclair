<h3>Jamie Percival</h3>
It wasn't long after the first issue of <b><i>YS3</i></b> was released that Jamie offered his services to the team. At that point the team consisted of Jon and Nathan, so naturally they jumped at the chance to spread the rather alarmingly-sized work that they had given themselves with the sort of ill-thought non-planning that guides so much of what they do and welcomed Jamie to the team. (Or rather, Nathan did, since Jon was in California learning to be a mime at that precise moment.) '<i>You can do the reviews</i>' Nathan said, cackling evilly and rubbing his hands in the manner of a sinister Victorian villain at the thought of never having to write about anything Spectrum-related ever again.
<br><br>
There's always a flaw, of course, and in this case it was that Jamie had that most fabled of rarities, a Life. As such, he was burdened too heavily to dedicate his life to The Cause, as had the clean-living (or dull and uninteresting, depending) Nathan and Jon. In spite of his Real Life responsibilities, however, Jamie was always there with suggestions and advice, and the occasional review too. (Hurrah!) On top of this, as a regular to comp.sys.sinclair, he also became responsible for some of the most ridiculously untrue rumours about <b><i>YS3</i></b> that drew plenty of attention to us, and as such became responsible for any advertising the team needed done.
<br><br>
Oh, and he likes curry.
