<h3>Jon Hyde</h3>
One of the dynamic duo responsible for <b><i>YS3</i></b> being started in the first place, it's a little-known fact that for the first four issues Jon wrote his copy from the United States, where he trained in California to be a mime. Upon his return he went on to study Philosophy and Theology at Oxford, taking short breaks to wind up the local fire brigade with requests to get him out of an invisible box. Having recently completed that degree, he has since begun studying to become a lawyer-type, with the ultimate aim of mastering the dark and mysterious ways of the New World Order. (Or maybe he won't go into commercial law.)
<br><br>
Easily the most prolific writer for <b><i>YS3</i></b>, Jon's contributions include almost all of the <i>Top 101 Things To Do While Waiting For Your Speccy To Load</i>, although strangely he can't remember writing any of them and insists that Nathan wrote it. (Jon really did write it, folks - Nathan wrote about ten, scattered across three or four issues.) After the burst of productivity in the early years Jon scaled back his contributions, particularly following the debut of the King of <i>Pssst!</i>, <b>Phil Robertshaw</b>, in order to accommodate his increasingly difficult student lifestyle of working hard at not looking like a lazy student layabout.
<br><br>
Incredibly, this is all absolutely true. Even the bit about mime training.
