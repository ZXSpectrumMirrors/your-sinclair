On occasion, Nathan finds himself with a little time on his hands. On very rare occasions, Nathan finds himself with far, far too much time on his hands, and nowhere near enough Lego to keep him away from a keyboard. On those occasions, Nathan has a tendency to post things to comp.sys.sinclair that have absolutely no relevance to anything that anyone is talking about.
<br><br>
So far there have been three stories starring Bob the penguin (the flightless deputy editor of YS3 with a shadowy past), each an episode in what promises to be an ongoing series. Here, for the first time ever, they are available from somewhere other than Google's Usenet archive.
<br><br>
<h2>Coats of Fury</h2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Posted in month 2000, this story is primarily about Niall Tracey and Llama-Wax Len. (It also stars the lovely Natalie Mayer, for reasons that Nathan can no longer remember. It was probably a good idea at the time.)

<br><br>
<h2>Lethal Penguin</h2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first story to feature Bob in a starring role. This semi-sequel to Coats of Fury also stars Jon, and features what are far and away the funniest three lines Nathan has ever written.

<br><br>
<h2>Lethal Penguin 2</h2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long-promised but until now never-delivered sequel to the 2000 sleeper hit, LP2 takes everything that was good about the first film, throws away all the in-jokes, and comes up with a coherent and in places almost interesting plot.

<br><br>
<h2>Lethal Penguin 3</h2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concluding the trilogy in fine style, LP3 is probably the best thing Nathan's ever written. With significantly more input from Jon, LP3 is bigger, better and bolder than the previous two films, albeit alarmingly darker in style in several places. Inevitably not the end of the Lethal Penguin series - Lethal Penguin Redux is due 'soon'.
