...Until the eighth issue was three weeks late, that is. Keeping the
layout of the previous issue, and staying away from the hideous optical
nightmare that was issue six's colour scheme, last month's YS3 was more
than a tad beefier on the features front, but once again all the reviews
were written by Nathan, who by this time had written all of the reviews
since issue six (except the Deviants one by Jamie, who'd written it a
month earlier).

<b>The Top 101 Things</b>
<br><br>
<b>Jon:</b>
<br><br>
I can’t believe we’ve almost written 101 of the things! Special thanks
go to my philosophy tutor for help last month, and to a random program
my mum was watching on TV for help the month before. And now I can start
recycling them! ...Er, is this thing still on? (Click.) 
<br><br>
<b>Nathan:</b>
<br><br>
Jon's responsible for most of these things. In total I've written maybe
<a href="note_fifteen.html" target=_blank>fifteen</a>. Despite this, whenever we go through the back issues, Jon can
never remember which ones are his. He gradually gets increasingly
confused, accusing me of writing the more bizarre ones and putting them
in when he's not looking. So if we did recycle them, Jon would never
know either. In fact, we have been recycling them since issue four.
<br><br><br>
<b>Actual Reality</b>
<br><br>
<b>Jon:</b>
<br><br>
Easily the most fun I’ve had in real life since I started the Cold War
in the sixties. Guns, guts and glory... yep, this is my favourite part
of the magazine and I’m really looking forward to “doing” Afterburner,
<a href="note_chasehq.html" target=_blank>Chase HQ</a> and <a href="note_barbarian.html" target=_blank>Barbarian</a>... not to mention <a href="note_als.html" target=_blank>Advanced Lawn Mower Simulator</a>. 
<br><br>
<b>Nathan:</b>
<br><br>
I'm not so sure about this one. I mean, it started well, but lately
things have just been getting silly. And do you know how much tin-foil
costs? Do you? It's reached the stage where we rent RoboJon out for
children's parties to make ends meet. Future of journalism, tchah.
