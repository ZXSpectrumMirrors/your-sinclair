<b>Top 101 Things To Do While Waiting For Your Speccy To Load</b><br><br>
As the heady summer months begin their long-awaited spell at the country’s climate controls, <i>YS3</i> grabs a chilled can of pop from the fridge, turns on the fan and brings you yet more wonderful things to do whilst your Speccy loads that latest software gem.
<ol start=80>
<li>Gaze out of your window longingly at the fluffy clouds above, and see how many different animals and shapes you can see before the game’s ready…</li>
<li>…then get a pop psychology book-thing and work out what your visions meant! Nathan saw a tap-dancing hippo, which apparently means that he needs to let his creative side out some more. Jamie saw a pony, which means he needs to get in touch with his feminine side, whilst David just cried “I’m melting! Melting!” and ran back inside, carefully avoiding the holy water we spilt on the floor earlier, the cross hanging from the door and the garlic on Jamie’s desk. Jon saw a small warthog named Bertie who told him next week’s winning lottery numbers, but Jon forgot them. Oh, well.</li>
<li>See how many chilled cans of fizzy pop you can drink in the loading time. The office record at <i>YS3</i> is seven by David, but then he suffered a mild stroke because of all the sugar and lost control of the left side of his body.</li>
<li>Go and change into a T-shirt and shorts on account of the wonderful weather.</li>
<li>Open the curtains and then try to get past the first few levels of <i>Manic Miner</i> with the glare on the screen. Jamie played the first level for about seven minutes before he was permanently blinded in his left eye.</li>
<li>If you’re over 18, (or over 21 in most American states (<i>But we don't have any American readers! Do we? Ed</i>) see how many shots of vodka you can down, whilst still being able to play the game. If in doubt, Nathan recommends going for the Spectrum in the middle.</li>
<li>Go daisy-picking with your chums, frolicking through the fields and woods with chains of freshly-picked flowers intricately woven around your neck. You know you want to. Nathan and Mrs. Hiddleton’s elementary ballet class find it quite relaxing.</li>
<li>Move the fridge into your videogaming cupboard so you can eat fresh Toffee Cream Slices without them melting all over your desk and clogging up the tape drive of your Speccy.</li>
<li>Send us a postcard or a summery e-mail or something. We get so lonely at <i>YS3</i> when everyone goes off on holiday or out to the parks for the day. Apart from Nathan and his ballerina friends, naturally… and Jamie with his SGC missions… and Jon with his multiple personalities… OK, so just for David’s sake (and he's normally hiding in the basement anyway), but you get the idea. Pretty please.</li>
<li>Pick some flowers for munching during your gaming session. <i>YS3</i> highly recommends daffodils.</li>
