And suddenly it all went horribly wrong. While it may appear to anyone
who has seen the sixth issue that Nathan was suffering from colour-
blindness, it did look absolutely stunning when it was posted. No,
really. Oh, alright then, it didn't, it looked atrocious, but he posted it
up anyway (the scamp). For those who braved the front page, things
weren't too bad inside - in fact they were even better than the previous
issue. Someone even submitted a game for the Smash .TAP - Chris Young's
<i>Journey to Yatton</i>. Which, er, had a nice loading screen.

<b>Futureshocks:</b> <i>Sabre Wulf PC</i>, <i>Sonic the Hedgehog</i>, <i>Willytron</i><br>

<b>TAP included:</b> <i>Journey to Yatton</i> by <a href="note_unsatisfactory.html" target=_blank>Unsatisfactory Software</a>.<br>
<b>What we really want to know is...</b> if the Terminator ever got built, how could it go back in time to stop itself being built?<br>
<b>Random stuff in the small print:</b> What did you get for Christmas? Nathan "inflatable chair" Cross, Jon "the last Due South video I didn’t have" Hyde, Jamie "socks" Percival, Chris "a screaming headache" Young.<br>
<b>It was a special issue because:</b> Of that colour scheme! What a sight for anyone to behold; even little Jimmy, Nathan’s colour-blind cousin of 5, fell to the floor screaming in agony upon seeing the contents page. Poor little tyke still has shakes whenever he goes near a monitor, which could disadvantage him for life.<br>

<b>Design and Redesign</b>
<br><br>
<b>Nathan:</b>
<br><br>
For the first four issues the mag was laid out quite badly. Abominably
so, in fact. Ish five (the Christmas ish) was alright, but I decided
that ish six should be as bright and colourful as the original <i>YS</i> was.
Unfortunately I misjudged things slightly, and we ended up with the most
hideous background of all time ever.
<br><br>
<b>Jon:</b>
<br><br>
I was dead impressed with the <i>YS3</i> logo right from the start, and the
Scooby Doo pictures. The Christmas issue was kind of groovy, being all
psychedelic . Closest I’ve ever come to an LSD trip... and convinced me
to steer clear of drugs. WINNERS DON’T TAKE DRUGS (<i>But pop stars, footballers and government ministers do... Ed</i>). But if you want to see something REALLY
colourful in its layout, more so that <i>YS3</i>, then try... er... Um... hmm.
No, <i>YS3</i> has the proverbial bull by the proverbial horns (<i>Oo-er. Ed</i>).
