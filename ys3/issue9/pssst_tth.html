<b>Number Nine - Pope John Paul II</b>

<i>Viatas, veri vita…</i> pardon, you only speak English? No, that’s fine, we can conduct the interview in English. I’m very well, thank you, my child. How are you? Jamie had problems on his last SGC mission, did he? Eaten by a mutant cucumber, was he? I’m sorry to hear that. I lost a cardinal that way with all this GM food going around. Terrible stuff, mucking about with the natural order of things. If God had wanted cucumbers to be seventeen feet tall and eat people, I think He would have created them that way, don’t you?

Oh yes, I remember the Spectrum. It was a veritable slice of imminent corporeal psychophysical cake, let me tell you. Had a few clashes with the first commandment, though. You know the one I’m talking about, don’t you? Speak up, I can’t hear you. No, no it’s got nothing to do with gluttony - that’s the other list of seven. No, but that’s in the top ten. You shall have no other Gods before the <font face="times new roman"><b>LORD</b></font> your God, is what it says. And I must confess that I did break it on one occasion…

It was time for church on Sunday as usual, but I’d just gotten hold of <i>Lunar Jetman</i> and I fancied one more go… of course, before I knew it I had missed the opening welcome and Scripture readings. Just then the whole building darkened and the Spectrum cut out. I saw one like the son of man descending, and He asked me what I was doing. I apologised profusely for playing on the Spectrum instead of going to church, and then He challenged me to a game of <i>Chaos</i>. I’ve never lost so quickly in all my life, but it was jolly good fun when He agreed to give me a chance. Ah yes, the Spectrum… you know I’m thinking of including one in the next chapel we make. Right up there at God’s left hand… I don’t think there’s anyone there yet. (Suddenly the room gets very dark and all the lights cut out.) Erk. I think you’d best be going now while I try to smooth things over. You could always come back for a spot of <i>Rebelstar</i> in a few minutes, you know…
