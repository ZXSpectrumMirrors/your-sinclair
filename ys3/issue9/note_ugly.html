Clint Eastwood is a damned fine actor, and his westerns are generally
perceived as being some of the best there are. <i>The Good, The Bad and The
Ugly</i> is a typical classic. If you haven't seen it, go out and get hold
of the video, along with <i>A Fistful of Dollars</i> and <i>For A Few Dollars
More</i>, both by the same director (Sergio Leone) and featuring the same
principal character (The Man With No Name).
