<h3>Subject: hey, John Hayes! (Mr YS3)</h3>

<br>
Your review of New Zealand Story in YS3, http://www.ys3.connectfree.co.uk/<br>
<br>
You say kiwis are from Australia. They aren't. They're unique to NZ(*). Your refer the the green centred furry fruit as "kiwis". They're "kiwi fruit". Very different. The use of the term "kiwi" to refer to the fruit is a vile americanism(**).<br> 
<br>
(*) Apart from the one is zoos. And computer games. And webpages. (**) So there.<br><br>

Well, he was close. A few miles out at this distance is pretty good going, in my opinion.<br>

Alright, fair enough. Vile americanisms deserve to be punished, so I'm going to force Jon to eat one hundred kiwi birds. I think he'll remember the difference between the fruit and the bird then.<br>

1500 miles is not close. It's about as close a London is to Moscow. Or this conversation to sense.<br>

That's alright then. I'm told they're good with prunes and a stiff chedar.<br>
This fortifies you for the long stay in prison for eating endangered species.<br><br>

I wish you'd warned us sooner. Jon is now in hiding after narrowly avoiding a Greenpeace hitman (they broke into Jon's kitchen and were distracted by a Toffee Cream Slice long enough for him to make his escape) and is living in fear of an RSPCA snatch squad tracking him down.<br>

Almost. By the ancient rules of Trainspotting, a claimant must have no mistakes in their claim. And since Jon Hyde wrote the review (NOT John Hayes!), no Trainspotter Award. (Phew.)<br> 
<br>
But! We do now have our first denied Trainspotter Award! Hurrah! May it be the first of many. Er... I think.<br>
