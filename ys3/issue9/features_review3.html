By this time the team were getting into the swing of things, and had finished with the design of the magazine to get on with the content. This month saw the first Smash .TAP; Mr Sweeney's <i>Hack Attack II</i> (which should have been on the covertape of the last <i>YS</i>) and <i>Professional Sheepdog Simulator</i>, by Coran Sanths.

And then it went away, for a very long time indeed...

<b>The YS3 Trilogy</b>
<br><br>
<b>Nathan:</b>
<br><br>
Issue Four was late. Very, very late. So late, in fact, that when I did
produce 'The YS3 Trilogy' as a kind of stop-gap measure, Jamie thought
we'd given up on the thing and sent an e-mail to make sure we hadn't! We
finally got it out though (oo-er), and only three months late. Ahem. For
those of you who missed it, here are the posts announcing 'The YS3
Trilogy' and ish four (separated by about three days).

<br><br>
<b>Jon:</b>
<br><br>
I was wondering if the mighty juggernaut of Spectrum magazining that is
YS3 would stop there and then, but then I wonder that every time an
issue goes past the deadline... usually because I’m trying to make up so
many letters without going schizophrenic... oh, what a give-away.
Seriously, I thought the trilogy was a neat idea, and provided a fun
stop-gap between issues. Maybe we should do it again...
