<b>1. Why did you start YS3?</b>
<br><br>
I’ve always dreamed of writing for a computer mag ever since I bought
<i>Total</i> and <i>Super Play</i> from <a href="note_future.html" target=_blank>Future Publishing</a>, so when Nathan came along
with the offer of writing for <i>YS3</i>, it was an offer I couldn’t refuse.
Especially with the knowledge that we were following in the footsteps of
the orig – sorry? We can’t use that word here? Oh, sorry. Guess that’s
that then. 
<br><br>
<b>2. What inspires you to write something every month (or thereabouts)?</b>
<br><br>
The knowledge that all those readers out there really want me to. That,
and I get this odd twitch if I don’t review or criticise something for
more than a fortnight. 
<br><br>
<b>3. What's your favourite Speccy game?</b>
<br><br>
One-player, it would have to be <i>Rainbow Islands</i>. If that game was a
woman, I’d have swept her off her feet and be happily married in
Eastbourne by now. The two-player award goes to <i>Chaos</i>. Never has setting
a dragon on your best friend been so much fun, and there’s the whole
epistemic dimension of it’s a dragon... or is it?! 
<br><br>
<b>4. Favourite snack?</b>
<br><br>
Twix. Or if I’m on a sugar-overload, salt and vinegar crisps. 
<br><br>
<b>5. Favourite TV show?</b>
<br><br>
<a href="note_duesouth.html" target=_blank><i>Due South</i></a>. It rocks. What other show has the immortal line. “<i>This is
Chicago, so unless someone shoots a moose this is out of your
jurisdiction!</i>” 
<br><br>
<b>6. Favourite film?</b>
<br><br>
<i>The Empire Strikes Back</i>. It has it all: violence, spaceships,
lightsabres, revelations, philosophy… and who could forget the moment
when they realise it isn’t an cave they’ve landed in… and Yoda rocks. I
just love the way his ears change when he replies to Luke’s claim that
he’s not frightened with “oh, you will be!”. I had it on video when I
was younger and watched it so many times I got sick of it, but then I
waited ten years before seeing it again and I’d forgotten all that
happened. Heck, I’d forgotten it was part of the <i>Star Wars</i> trilogy and
was about to write to George Lucas and tell him there were only two
films in his so-called “trilogy”. Classic stuff. 
<br><br>
<b>7. How many kiwi birds does it take to change a light bulb?</b>
<br><br>
Well, I have a light bulb here, and a box of Kiwi Birds... maybe I should
try one… they’re so cute and crispy... I... (gobble, crunch, squeak. Burp.)
Sorry. Got another box?
