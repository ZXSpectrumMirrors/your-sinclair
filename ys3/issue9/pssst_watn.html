“Thank you kindly.” Precious few catch-phrases have achieved the heights of fame that these three words enjoy, ranking up there with “shaken, not stirred” and “make it so!” Women all over Canada and northern America swooned at the man in the bright-red jacket who uttered these few syllables, one Constable Benton Fraser of the RCMP, as seen in <i>due SOUTH</i>.

The eponymous Mountie of the show came to Chicago in the pilot episode on the trail of the killers of his father and, for reasons that didn’t need exploring at any juncture of the third series, remained in the city, attached as liaison to the Canadian consulate. Partnered with one wise-cracking city cop then another, Fraser battled crime on the streets the old-fashioned way, hanging onto speeding cars, out-witting the villains with his truly encyclopaedic knowledge and sniffing doggy piddle.

And it was these skills honed in the wild outbacks of the Yukon that gave Constable Fraser his edge. The man could ride anything on four legs, get number plate info from soap-crusts and track his beloved (and deaf) wolf across many blocks of city. Of course, spending most of his social time with snow gave him all the relational canny of a blind hamster, but the ladies didn’t mind. With his colourful uniform and rugged good looks, the women fawned left, right and centre, and his honest heart and unbreakable loyalty made him the first choice for any good cop looking for a reliable partner. Couple that with the utmost determination to do the right thing, and it’s no wonder that this Mountie got his man.. and woman… and sometimes even babies for the whole three years that the magical - and wonderfully bizarre - phenomenon that was <i>due SOUTH</i> lasted.
