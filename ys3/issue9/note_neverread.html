Nathan does, however, read <i>Bootleg Amiga Power</i> (or at least, he did
before it seemingly shut up shop), and has been meaning to include links
to it since the first day of <i>YS3</i>. Unsurprisingly, he has completely
<a href="note_links.html">failed to ever link</a> to it. Until now! Get your <i>Bootleg AP</i> from
<a href="http://www.bumfluff.co.uk/">http://www.bumfluff.co.uk/</a>, then harass Adam Keyte (the editor) until he
writes another issue! You know it makes sense!
