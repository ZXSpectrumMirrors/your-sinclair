Our first Christmas, and doesn't Scooby look cute in that little Santa hat? Despite a falling number of hits, Nathan took the trouble to overhaul the design of the site and make it look halfway professional. While the internal strife increases (because nobody wants to review anything), the sheer quality of the magazine begins to really shine.

<b>Supposedly released according to last month’s Next Month:</b> December 6th 1999<br>
<b>Actually Released:</b> December 20th 1999<br>
<b>OPI:</b> 433<br>
<b>Reviews:</b> <i>The Official Father Christmas Game</i> 70°; <i>Robin of the Wood</i> 72°; <i>Santa’s Search</i> 12°<br>
<b>Features:</b> <i>Burgertime</i> took McDonalds to task, condescending to give them a measly 30%, which seems hugely overly-generous in retrospect. Nathan made his timely contribution to the features with  look at the ever-expanding remake culture, and <a href="note_young.html" target=_blank>Chris Young</a> was officially named winner of the ill-fated Siberian Mining Penguins competition.<br>
<b>Trainspotters Throughout History:</b> Dale Winton.<br>
<b>Where Are They Now?</b> Superted.<br>
<b>TAP included:</b> <i>Advanced Lawn Mower Simulator - Xmas Edition</i> by <a href="note_coran.html" target=_blank>Coran Sanths</a>. What a gift. (<i>At least, I think it says gift. Ed</i>)<br>
<b>What we really want to know is...</b> why is there a coin or two in Christmas pudding?<br>
<b>Random stuff in the small print:</b> Nathan and his spectacular performing PC.<br>
<b>It was a special issue because:</b> It was Christmas, and anyone’s first Christmas is always a special occasion. Although it was a couple of weeks late, Nathan experienced his very own <a href="note_miracle.html" target=_blank>seasonal miracle</a> in the help he received in getting his suicidal PC on its feet.<br>

<b>Features</b>
<br><br>
<b>Jon:</b>
<br><br>
Probably the hardest thing about a feature is getting inspired to write it, followed by the research that goes into making it! For a newcomer to the magazine scene, I think <i>YS3</i> has provided a good selection of features, from the wacky (the ones I wrote) to the intelligent (like David's Emulegal series) and the downright profound (like the Bible... (<i>Er, we didn't write that. Ed</i>) Well, only 'cause God got there first...). By the way, if anyone finds out how to actually get <i>Top Gun</i> working past the title screen – answers on a postcard to the usual address!

<b>Nathan:</b>
<br><br>
Unlike Jon, I find the hardest thing about a feature is finding accompanying pictures. For last month's feature on the Playstation 2, I had a definite design in my mind, and I needed pictures of all the major 'next generation' consoles and a Speccy. Do you have any idea of how difficult it is to find a half-decent picture of an N64? This is why I have to keep recycling the Scooby-Doo pics - I can't find any more. (I can find, er, 'adult' ones of Daphne, but none of Scoob.) If you have any pics of Scooby, send them to the usual address.
