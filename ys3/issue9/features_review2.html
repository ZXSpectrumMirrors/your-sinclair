One month on, and these upstarts show no signs of going away. In fact, there are more of them, thanks to Jamie Percival. A mildly improved selection of articles, this time, with those tedious lists consigned to the bin. And thanks to Gerard Sweeney's input, the girlie this month is Lisa from Steps. By this time people had started reading, and the first Trainspotter Award was claimed, but not awarded...

Although nobody really tries to spot the mistakes any more (possibly because of the sheer volume of them), somebody did try to on <a href="news:comp.sys.sinclair">comp.sys.sinclair</a> after Jon's incredible mistake in his review of <i>The New Zealand Story</i> in the second ish. I copied the posts, so here we go...

Yes, the <i>New Zealand Story</i> affair. I stand by my story that my copy said “Australian Story” on the title screen, and all the encyclopaedias in my house said that kiwi birds are from Australia. Fortunately Nathan was able to deftly get me out of trouble and introduce me to my favourite snack... after Twix and salt and vinegar crisps.
