The fourth issue leapt back into action with more of the same old nonsense. People were finally catching on that we were here, though (possibly due to the sheer length and bizarreness of the announcing posts). To date, it is the latest and most over-hyped issue of <i>YS3</i> ever, and like <i>Heart of Darkness</i> and <i>Batman Forever</i>, it wasn't really as good as it should have been. Ahem.

<b>Supposedly released according to last month’s Next Month:</b> October 1st 1999 (cough, splutter!)<br>
<b>Actually Released:</b> <a href="note_nov29.html" target=_blank>November 29th 1999</a><br>
<b>OPI:</b> 600<br>
<b>Reviews:</b> <i>Attack of the Mutant Camels</i> 90°; <i>The Birds and the Bees</i> 70°; <i>ESWAT</i> 1°; <i>Target; Renegade</i> 90°<br>
<b>Features:</b> <i>Burgertime</i> made its glorious entrance with a definitive review of Burger King in Bristol, giving it a fair 65%. We also held our incredibly under-subscribed Siberian Mining Penguins competition, which only one person was brave enough to enter.<br>
<b>Trainspotters Throughout History:</b> Clive Anderson.<br>
<b>Where Are They Now?</b> Duran Duran.<br>
<b>TAP included:</b> <i>Advanced Line-Painter Simulator</i> by <a href="note_coran.html" target=_blank>Coran Sanths</a>. What a follow-up to <i>Hack Attack II</i>, eh folks?<br>
<b>What we really want to know is...</b> why do men's shirts button one way and women's another?<br>
<b>Random stuff in the small print:</b> YS3 merchandise by sales@ys3.co.uk.<br>
<b>It was a special issue because:</b> It was almost two months late! The YS3 Trilogy page went up in the middle, causing global panic that the magazine had finished. Fortunately it had not, and patient readers were rewarded with another issue some 59 days after it was promised.<br>

<b>Burgertime</b>
<br><br>
<b>Nathan:</b>
<br><br>
We started this one in ish four, when Jon and I visited Burger King. I dragged along my girlfriend, for reasons best left undiscussed. I don't remember that much about it, apart from <a href="note_sarah.html" target=_blank>Sarah</a> not saying anything at all for the half hour or so that we were there, and my burger had <a href="note_onionrings.html" target=_blank>onion rings</a> in it.
<br><br>
The food we got from McDonalds was bad, even for them. I foolishly assumed that we'd get preferential treatment because <a href="note_workedthere.html" target=_blank>I'd worked there</a>, but no.
<br><br>
<b>Jon:</b>
<br><br>
I think this was a great addition to the magazine, and I thoroughly enjoyed having burgers on <a href="note_companytime.html" target=_blank>company time and money</a> (or at least on Nathan’s money)! I also got to meet Sarah for the first time (and proved that she actually exists), and it was worth it all to <a href="note_publicridicule.html" target=_new>publicly ridicule McDonalds</a>. HAH.
