And suddenly it all went horribly right. A total redesign saw the
introduction of a new logo, new colour scheme, whole new front page
layout, and the disappearance of the gratuitous scantily-clad girlie. It
was all beginning to look and feel like a solid, professional
magazine...

<b>The Gratuitous Scantily-Clad Girlie</b>
<br><br>
<b>Nathan:</b>
<br><br>
The GSCG wasn't in the original plan. I mentioned I was building a website to someone at work (hello Amz!) and he said that it absolutely had to have a picture of Vanessa Angel. I told him that the website was about an ancient computer, and he told me it didn't matter, there just had to be a picture of Vanessa Angel on it. I figured it'd be an amusing distraction, and up it went. 
<br><br>
Jon never liked the girlie section, and told me so on a number of occasions. I was a little unsure about it, but left it in because, well, it wasn't 'material of an adult nature', and it was mildly amusing. After the Sarah Michelle Gellar pic, though, Jon expressed concern that we were heading towards a more <i>FHM</i> style. I agreed, and we dropped the feature. (Apart from the Melissa Hart pic that I sneaked past on <a href="note_oldsite.html" target=_blank>the old site</a>, heh heh.)
<br><br>
I have been considering a <i>YS3 Complete Girlies</i> thing, but when I checked the Resources folder it came to fourteen megs.
<br><br>
<b>Jon:</b>
<br><br>
As Nathan did most of the 'research' there’s not much I can say, other than that I’m glad we dropped it to avoid that total <i>FHM</i>-feel. And if the SCG were the only women you ever saw, then hopefully it encouraged you to (<i><a href="note_getalife.html" target=_blank>'go out and socialise more'</a> Ed</i>).
