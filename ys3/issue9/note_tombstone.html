A classic western, featuring what is quite possibly one of the most
realistic and tensest stand-offs outside of <i>Reservoir Dogs</i>. Retelling
the story of the Wild West's most celebrated lawman, Wyatt Earp,
<i>Tombstone</i> is more gritty and realistic than its many forebears, but
lacks some of the style of a Clint Eastwood film.
