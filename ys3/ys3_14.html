Once again everybody concluded that YS3 was deader than a very dead thing. Everybody agreed that Nathan had finally Got His Coat. (Perhaps even an oak coat.) It was at this point that Nathan came back again, and with him YS3.
<br><br>
While not made immediately obvious, this issue was written entirely by Nathan. A feat never before attempted, Nathan put together the magazine mostly from articles written over the previous few months, adding a few more for good measure, and even writing a couple of reviews. It's undeniably down to Nathan, then, that this issue has a noticably darker tone than any previous one, from the Letters page rant against the people who read YS3 to the sad, self-obsessed plea for love.
<br><br>
Things had changed on the contents front, too. The Top 101 Things was over. Burgertime was nowhere to be seen. A couple of strange new features appeared, in the shape of Professor Winston K Pomegranate-Hugely and the Stella-fuelled Through The Drinking Glass. 
<br><br>
After this issue, though, Nathan got his coat once more. The domain registration lapsed. This time it really was over.
