<font color="#ff0000"><b>Bob (obviously struggling to keep his emotions in check):</b></font> Well, I don’t know… I… Nathan… Jon… I…
<br><br>
<font color="#3f3fff"><b>Terry:</b></font> So why did you do it, why did you leave him like that, without a word?
<br><br>
<font color="#cf00cf"><b>Nathan:</b></font> I had other projects. It was time to move on.
<br><br>
<font color="#00cf00"><b>Jon (Still bawling):</b></font> I’m so sorry, Bob! I’m so, so sorry! I’ve been such an idiot to leave you all this time! I was offered a full-time position as mime liaison to the French government, and I took it! I sacrificed you for my own selfish ends! (<i>He falls to his knees before Bob</i>) Can you ever forgive me?!
<br><br>
<font color="#ff0000"><b>Bob:</b></font> I… well… I…
<br><br>
<font color="#3f3fff"><b>Terry:</b></font> Nathan, do you have anything to add?
<br><br>
<font color="#cf00cf"><b>Nathan:</b></font> I’ve got nothing to say to you, you double-crossing BLEEEP!. (<i>The audience gasps in horror. Terry takes it like a hero.</i>) And I’ve got nothing to say to that ungrateful little sod, either. Ate me out of house and home with those cream slices of his. Selfish little BLEEEP!… and Jon, pull yourself together. It’s not like we were close-knit or anything.
<br><br>
<font color="#00cf00"><b>Jon:</b></font> How can you say that?! Have you no heart? Are you as stone-blooded as the like-named Decrouxian exercise in object identification? What about Tim here? How could we leave him?
<br><br>
<font color="#3f3fff"><b>Terry:</b></font> It’s Bob…
<br><br>
<font color="#00cf00"><b>Jon:</b></font> Sure it is. See what I mean? All those years we spent gambolling through the corn fields like lambs, singing classical Spanish opera and dancing under the full moon.
<br><br>
<font color="#3f3fff"><b>Terry:</b></font> Actually, you did a magazine together… a web-based fanzine job with dubious legal connections with both Future Publishing and Dennis Publishing...
<br><br>
<font color="#00cf00"><b>Jon:</b></font> And those wistful summers spent at Camp Mexico, eating tacos and drinking cheap beer… (<i>He is lost in his memories.</i>)
<br><br>
<font color="#cf00cf"><b>Nathan:</b></font> I always said that silent stuff would screw you up… but then a mime’s a terrible thing to waste.
