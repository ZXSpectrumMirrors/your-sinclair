But why isn't the Ed's comments in brackets as they used to be? Also, beeing Swedish, I demand a "hurdie-hurdie-ho!" as a heading!<br> <br>And can I have a Trainspotter Award please?<br> <br>Regards,<br>Johan<br>http://www.ic.chalmers.se/~johan/Spectre.html<br><br><i>All my comments are in brackets! Except for the ones like this, where it's just me writing. (I could write these in brackets too, but that'd just get confusing.) (</i>Especially when I insert comments, like this one. Jon<i>). Still, I'll let you have the letter heading. And you can't have a Trainspotter. You'd have to spot an error in our notoriously error-free production for one of those. You wouldn't be the first to attempt it either...<br></i><br></td></tr><tr><td><h3>Trainspotter<br></h3>Hello.<br><br>I should like to claim a Trainspotter Award for noticing the ommission of a space between the words on and a, in your Input Output sections opening paragraph.<br><br>Now tell me what's wrong with this letter? I'm sure you want to.<br><br>Chris Hines<br><br><i>You missed out the possessive apostrophe on 'section's'. You also misspelled 'omission.' Next.<br></i><br></td></tr><tr><td><h3>Traitorspotter<br></h3>Dear YS3 (that's us)<br><br>I hereby claim a Trainspotter for noticing a mistake in... er, our magazine. In Burgertime, it is erroneously claimed that purple is a primary colour. Now, as any artist, or just about anyone knows, the primary colours are red, blue and yellow. Purple is an amalgamation of red and blue, and is therefore a secondary colour. So, erm, there! If I don't get a Trainspotter for that, then a Toffee Cream Slice will do. I seem to remember someone else hiding them all last time!<br><br>Phil Robertshaw, YS3<br><br><i>You're fired.<br></i><br></td></tr><tr><td><h3>Punctual<br></h3>So guys... I'm sat at my computer, supposed to be doing coursework for my degree... but instead I'm looking at issue ten... again! Will you ever publish on time?<br><br>Love it tho, <br>paul.<br><br><i>If we ever get paid for it, yes.<br></i><br></td></tr><tr><td><h3>Demise Through The Fawning References<br></h3>I never read YS. But I knew of it, long after its demise, through the fawning references that filled countless other Future publications. I wish I had read it now, even though I never had a spectrum.<br><br>The Man With No Name<br><br><i>I suppose I could helpfully point you at either <a href="http://www.ysac.cjb.net/">Your Sinclair: A Celebration</a> or the heavily-plugged <a href="http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/">Your Sinclair Rock'n'Roll Years</a>, but instead I'm going to tell you that Your Sinclair was just like YS3, only not as good. Ahem.<br></i><br></td></tr><tr><td><h3>THE SHNIBBULAR ONE COMETH! (Again.)<br></h3>Hey Nathan<br><br>I heard you were lain low for a while. Get well soon. My days are almost unbearable with the thought that no-one is stalling on the next issue of YS3.<br><br>And if anyone out there reads this, be sure to give the message to Nathan. Remember that Christmas is coming soon and Father Christmas is taking special notice of this situation... I know this because he told me so...<br><br>Cheers and once again get well soon.<br><br>Brendan. AKA. THE SHNIBBULAR ONE, Shnibble, Rundie and sometimes Runt<br><br><i>Ah, Christmas - a time of goodwill for all. There is something that we at YS3 would like this Christmas, actually. We'd like you to spread the word about how good YS3 is. (Exaggerate it a bit, though, eh?) Tell all your friends about us. If you have a website, link to us. (There are approximately five sites on the internet linking to us at the moment.) The more readers we get, the more inclined we are to write stuff. You never know, we might even get an issue out on time! (Possibly.)<br></i><br></td></tr><tr><td><h3>Help!<br></h3>I am looking for a Z80 simulator called Win 80 I can't seem to find it anywhere. Could you please help me find it.<br><br>Thankyou <br>Nairobi2000@*********<br><br><i>I couldn't find it. Anybody else?<br></i><br></td></tr><tr><td><h3>Words Like Ooze<br></h3>Despite of my poor English, with the help of a dictionary to translate <br>words like ooze or gullet, I've had a great time reading your article about <br>crap games, I dunno how you say this in England , but here we'd say 'your <br>sense of humor is sharp' :)<br><br>Congratulations,  hope to read you next month (I might work on the idea of <br>an article of Spanish Crap Games :) (I know you Britts, would say "aren't <br>all Spanish games a crap?) :)<br><br>See you! and again, congratulations<br>Ivan Ruiz Etxabe<br><br><i>Glad you enjoy the mag, although your chances of reading any issue only one month after the previous one are pretty slim. (Ivan's letter was received in January, fact fans - still, only six months late, eh? Ahem.)<br><br>And as for Spanish games, we wouldn't say they were crap. They just tend to be so hard that the average Brit can't get past the loading screen.<br></i><br></td></tr><tr><td><h3>Oh No!<br></h3>Dear Sirs,<br><br>The spectrum is now defunct.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Chris<br><br><i>Blimey, I never realised. Well, that's that, then. Pack up the gear, lads, let's go home.<br></i><br></td></tr><tr><td><h3>Just Call Us Plug Central<br></h3>Hi :)<br><br>A couple of years ago I wrote a comprehensive set of pages all about Tau Ceti - a game I absolutely loved on my Speccy.<br><br>I've realised I ought to get it linked to on a few speccy sites so people can actually <i>know</i> about the pages.<br><br>They're pretty cool, even if I do say so myself :)  If you're not familar with the game, you had to travel in your hovercraft type craft through a large number of cities (first person perspective, no less!) collecting cooling rods to shut down the main reactor.<br><br>There's a downloadable snapshot of the game for each city, the site uses Jasper so you can play each city on it's page, there's a big ass old run down of the mission, the buildings, the defences and the map.<br><br>All tastefully done in the original black and yellow :)<br><br>The only bad side is that not having the original box I can't quite remember the storyline exactly so some of what I've written will need correcting once other people read it and tell me it's wrong.<br><br>URL: <a href="http://www.summerblue.net/games/tau-ceti/index.html">http://www.summerblue.net/games/tau-ceti/index.html</a><br><br>Toby :)<br><br><i>I loved Tau Ceti, despite being really bad at it (</i>So what's new? Jon<i>). In fact, way back in the mists of time, before YS3 was even a vague idea, I built a website which had some bits on Tau Ceti. I was crushed, then, to see how much better your site was than my feeble attempt all those years ago. Bah.<br></i><br></td></tr><tr><td><h3>Poet Laureate, 2001<br></h3>A poem composed whilst waiting for my spectrum to load. Well, if I had a Spectrum I could've composed it whilst waiting for it to load, but as I now have an emulator I, oh sod it... Here's the poem:<br> <br>ROSES ARE RED, SOMETIMES<br>VIOLETS ARE VIOLET, BUT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS POEM CAN WE AGREE THAT THEY ARE BLUE?<br>THIS POEM SUCKS<br>HAPPY NEW YEAR TO YOU.<br><br>thx1138<br><br><i>While I was 'doing' GCSE English, I was compelled, along with my classmates, to write a poem. While I am reasonably good at writing in general, for some reason I have no skill at poetry. As such, I resorted to the only possible course of action - I used the PFN Random Poetry Generator that came with YS to write a poem. Imagine the fear and trepidation that filled my heart (and disbelieving amusement that filled Jon's) when the time came for essays to be returned. My own (or rather, my Speccy's) effort was held until the very end.<br><br>I got twenty-seven out of thirty, the best score of the class, and was asked to explain the difficult bits to my English teacher. Who says computers can't teach you anything, eh?<br></i><br></td></tr><tr><td><h3>More Plugs Than Dixons<br></h3>Hi.  I noticed that my group wasn't mentioned in Inny-Outy.<br><br>AlchNews has been going since about 1990, it used to be an electronic magazine on all Spectrum formats (even some obscure ones which nobody even remembers) but is now a bi-monthly A5 paper publication for Sinclair and Cambridge Z88.  More details (and all back issues) are on my site.<br><br>Andy Davis BSc.<br><a href="http://www.alchemistresearch.com">http://www.alchemistresearch.com</a><br><br><i>Everybody! Go have a look at AlchNews now! (Just remember to come back here when you're done, eh?)<br></i><br></td></tr><tr><td><h3>Any Old Spectrum<br></h3>Please if you want, send me any old Spectrum related magazines like Your Sinclair, etc.<br><br>Bohus Kral<br>Smolenicka 14<br>Bratislava<br>85105<br>Slovakia<br><br><i>Unfortunately I don't have any spares. One of you lot out there might be feeling generous, though - if so you can e-mail me and I'll put you in touch with Bohus. Until then, if you're looking to read articles from YS, why not try the YS Rock'n'Roll Years? (Links all over the shop, so I'm not going to blimmin' type it in again. Honestly, I reckon I plug Nick's site more than this one.)<br></i><br></td></tr><tr><td><h3>Pinky And The Brain<br></h3>The <a href="http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/ys3/">YS3 Rock'n'Roll Years<a/> is a product of sheer genius. I would like to warn you about going TOO far, though... some people think we're the same person already, whilst others think we're plotting to take over the world.<br><br>Bagsy Chicago and New York.<br><br>Nick Humphries<br><br><i>I shouldn't worry - Bob's already been assigned to keep a close eye on those people...<br></i><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><font face="arial, helvetica" size=3><br><br><a href="index.html">Contents</a></font></td></tr></table></center></body>
