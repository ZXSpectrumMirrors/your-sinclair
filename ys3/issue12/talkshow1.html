<font color="#3f3fff"><b>Terry:</b></font> Yes, ladies and gentlemen, the most heart-breaking story I’m sure you’ve heard since yesterday’s show. The poor little mite was left all by himself at the tender age of fifteen. Now he’s forty, and we’ve got him on the show today. Please put your hands together for Bob!<br><br>
<font color="#125453">(<i>There is emotional applause as Bob shyly walks in from stage right, and plonks himself down in one of the easy chairs.</i>)</font><br><br>
Bob, welcome to the show.
<br><br>
<font color="#ff0000"><b>Bob:</b></font> Thanks for having me, Terry.
<br><br>
<font color="#3f3fff"><b>Terry:</b></font> Now, Bob, you don’t know why we invited you here today, do you? You think you’re here as part of some feature on the growing pains of middle-age penguins.
<br><br>
<font color="#ff0000"><b>Bob:</b></font> Well, I am, aren’t I? That interview was all about that, right? This is Wildlife on One..?
<br><br>
<font color="#3f3fff"><b>Terry:</b></font> Actually, the truth is bigger than that Bob. Today we’re going to be reuniting families, and we’ve managed to track down your two missing links: Nathan and Jon. <font color="#125453">(<i>Everyone, especially </i>Bob<i>, is shocked and enthralled by this revelation.</i>)</font> In fact, we have them waiting in the wings right now. <font color="#125453">(<i>The projector comes to life once more to show </i>Nathan<i> and </i>Jon<i> standing around, unkempt and with cigarettes in their mouths.</i>)</font> Nathan and Jon, would you please come in! <font color="#125453">(<i>The shock on </i>Bob<i>’s face is marked as the two enter from stage left. They are even more surprised to see him, and </i>Jon<i> stops halfway across the stage, and bursts into floods of tears. </i>Nathan<i> is outraged.</i>)</font>
<br><br>
<font color="#3f3fff"><b>Terry:</b></font> Welcome to the show, Na-
<br><br>
<font color="#cf00cf"><b>Nathan:</b></font> What the hell is this? I thought I was here for a feature on the history of Speccy games, and you pull this? What the hell kind of a stunt is this?
<br><br>
<font color="#3f3fff"><b>Terry:</b></font> Nathan, we’ve brought you here to reconcile you to Bob today. Twenty-five years ago you stepped out of his life without a word…
<br><br>
<font color="#cf00cf"><b>Nathan:</b></font> Yeah?
<br><br>
<font color="#3f3fff"><b>Terry:</b></font> …  and we’re here to put your little family back together. Bob, is there anything you’d like to say?
