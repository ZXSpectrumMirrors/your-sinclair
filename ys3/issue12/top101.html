All good things come to those who wait… but also, and more appropriately here, all good things come to an end. Which is why office assistant Earl will no longer be the constant friend and companion of <i>Word</i> users since <i>Word 2000</i> does not support him. Blue, wiry and the coolest dude since Elvis, Earl will be sadly missed by all. (<i>Ahem. Ed</i>) Well, nearly all. Oh, and if anyone’s interested, the Top 101 is ending this month as well. But compared with the passing of a small, blue cartoon cat who pulled out  large drum and beat it when you forgot to save changes (or used the word count), it pales into insignificance. So long, Earl.

<li>Use an emulator to load the games instantaneously, thus avoiding the need to wait for it to load. Of course, if you really want to use the last 100 ideas (and don’t have a real Speccy with a tape deck), you could always slam the emulation speed right down. There’s always a way to wait three minutes for quality software to load if you really want to.<br><br></li>
