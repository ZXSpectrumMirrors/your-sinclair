<h3>Number Twelve - Father Christmas</h3>
<br><br>
We were all sitting in our palatial offices here at YS3 HQ arguing about which famous Speccy owner we should visit next. All, that is, except Steven, who had wisely gone to the cinema. Jeff had already eaten all the mince pies under the pretence of ‘reviewing’ them for Burgertime, and tempers were getting, if not frayed, then slightly threadbare. No-one could agree. And then Nathan came up with a superb idea (his first of the year, readers). Why not interview the man who had delivered more Speccies than anyone else in the world - ever! (he says, trying not to sound like an advert for a music compilation). Lots were drawn, and it was <b>Phil Robertshaw</b> who raided the next year’s tea and Toffee Cream Slices money and made the long trip to Lapland. Here is the full, exclusive interview.
<br><br>
<i><b>Father Christmas?</b></i>
<br><br>
“No, I’m a penguin.”
<br><br>
<i><b>Really? I didn’t know penguins wore red suits. Except on Christmas cards, of course… ahem.</b></i>
<br><br>
“Did you just come here to make silly comments?”
<br><br>
<i><b>Yes! Er, I mean, not precisely ‘yes’. More ‘no’, really.</b></i>
<br><br>
“What do you want? I am busy, you know”
<br><br>
<i><b>Oh, what do you do? (catches eye of Father Christmas). (meekly) Erm, yes, you must be very busy at this time of year. 
We’d like to know about the influence of the Speccy on your life. Please.</b></i>
<br><br>
“Oh, damnation! Is that it?”
<br><br>
<i><b>What’s the problem? Aren’t you supposed to be all jolly, and say ‘ho ho ho’ a lot?</b></i>
<br><br>
“I… I suppose so. Erm, the Speccy, eh? Well, I’ve seen more Speccies than you’ve had Christmas dinners, young man. Ho ho ho!”
<br><br>
<i><b>So have I.</b></i>
<br><br>
“Now, look here, will you stop… er, ho ho ho! Where was I?”
<br><br>
<i><b>You were saying you’ve seen a lot of Speccies.</b></i>
<br><br>
“Ah, yes. There was a time when I used to deliver more Speccies than you’ve had Christm… er, hot dinners?”
<br><br>
<i><b>Keep going, you’re doing well.</b></i>
<br><br>
“Oh. Good. As I was saying, it used to make my heart melt to think of all those little boys and girls waking up and playing on their new Speccy on Christmas morning. If they could get the games to load, of course. Ho ho ho!”
<br><br>
<i><b>Er, ho, ho, ho. But do you still get many requests for Speccies now?</b></i>
<br><br>
(thinks) “About as many as I get for back issues of CRASH! magazine”
<br><br>
<i><b>Really? We didn’t know it was that bad. But you still play on your Speccy a lot, don’t you?</b></i>
<br><br>
“ I do, of course. But don’t ask me about that dreaded…” (starts to shake)
<br><br>
<i><b>Santa’s Xmas Caper?</b></i>
<br><br>
“Aarrgghh! No! Please! The presents, the presents! The collision detection! Help!”
<br><br>
<i><b>(coughs tactfully) So you didn’t like it much then?</b></i>
<br><br>
“That so-called ‘game’ was nothing but an insult! Did you not see it? If I ever find the programmers responsible, just let me say that it’ll be my reindeer who leave their ‘presents’ for them.”
<br><br>
<i><b>No problem. Here are their addresses.</b></i>
<br><br>
(grinning evilly) “Ha! I think I’m going to enjoy Christmas this year. Ho ho ho!”
<br><br>
<i><b>Erm, yes. Moving on… what games do you like?</b></i>
<br><br>
“The trouble with games is they always have a ‘happy’ ending. I’m writing my own, actually.”
<br><br>
<i><b>Yes…?</b></i>
<br><br>
“It’s about a man who gets greedy children writing to him, with appalling spelling and grammar. He has to visit every country in the world and teach them to be more thoughtful. He does it by shooting them as an example to others.”
<br><br>
<i><b>In fact, it’s about you not wanting to do your job, isn’t it? Where’s your Christmas spirit?</b></i>
<br><br>
(burps) “I’ve already drunk it! Ho ho ho!”
<br><br>
<i><b>I think it’s about time I left.</b></i>
<br><br>
“I’m sorry! Please don’t go! I’m very lonely here. I’ve only got my Speccy for company…”
<br><br>
<i><b>Goodbye, Father Christmas. Keep taking the Prozac.</b></i>
<br><br>
