<font color="#3f3fff"><b>Terry:</b></font> What about our members of the audience? What do you have to say to our reticent parents? (<i>A lady stands up, and is quickly picked up by a microphone.</i>)
<br><br>
<font color="#3f3f3f"><b>Lady:</b></font> I think it’s just disgraceful! How could you leave this poor fellow alone for so long? Have you no heart? (<i>Nathan doesn’t even bother to reply. Another Lady gets up.</i>)
<br><br>
<font color="#3f3f3f"><b>Lady #2:</b></font> I don’t understand how two men could father a penguin…
<br><br>
<font color="#cf00cf"><b>Nathan:</b></font> Long story. Messy. DNA splicing, government conspiracy, gratuitous swearing. Don’t ask.
<br><br>
<font color="#3f3fff"><b>Terry:</b></font> Bob, what about you? Is there anything you want to say to your parents after all these years?
<br><br>
<font color="#ff0000"><b>Bob (Suddenly collected):</b></font> Yes, in fact, I do. (<i>He folds his flippers across his lap and looks up at Terry.</i>) I knew all along that your little ploy was a trick, Terry. (<i>The audience gasp in surprise.</i>) In fact, I planned on meeting these two ingrates again, and I brought a little surprise. (<i>He reaches under his chair and pulls out a sawn-off shotgun.</i>) Happy BLEEP!ing reunion, <i>Dads</i>! Hahahahaha! (<i>Nathan’s eyes widen in shock and he leaps for cover as shotgun pellets spray the chair behind him. Jon is not so quick, and takes a blast straight through the chest. The chair topples over as Jon falls twitching to the floor.</i>) So, my beloved parents, how do you like it? I’ve been plotting my revenge on you two miserable BLEEEP!s for years, and now I have my chance! You’ll regret the day you screwed me over! (<i>Another blast peppers the chair behind which Nathan is hiding. The third blast gets through the chair and hits his arm, before security wrestles Bob to the ground and drag him  and Jon’s prone form off.</i>) You dirty BLEEEP!s! Come here so I can bite you to death! (<i>He nearly gets away from security, but their grip is sure.</i>) Dammit! I’ll get you next time, Cross! (<i>Nathan unsteadily gets to his feet and sits down on the only intact chair, trying to recover himself.</i>)
