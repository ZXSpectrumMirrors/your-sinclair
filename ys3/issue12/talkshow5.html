<font color="#3f3fff"><b>Terry:</b></font> Let’s go to our audience for their comments. Yes, the gentleman over there.
<br><br>
<font color="#3f3f3f"><b>Man:</b></font> Look, any man who’s anyone has to be true to his word. If he says that the mag’s coming out at a certain time, it’s got to come out then. You have to stick to what you say. (<i>The audience cheer as he sits down.</i>)
<br><br>
<font color="#cf00cf"><b>Nathan:</b></font> It’s not as easy as it looks, you know. There’s articles to get from so many people, HTML to write, pictures to hunt down… hours alone are spent getting the scantily-clad girlie and the Scooby pics… (<i>Another woman stands up.</i>)
<br><br>
<font color="#3f3f3f"><b>Lady #3:</b></font> You should never have started it if you couldn’t handle it! I know men from all over who start things they can’t finish, like my ex-husband. The little creep spent years promising he’d put up the shelves we got for our wedding, but did they ever go up? Did they hell! And I remember the time…
<br><br>
<font color="#3f3fff"><b>Terry:</b></font> Perhaps Nathan would like to reply?
<br><br>
<font color="#cf00cf"><b>Nathan:</b></font> You all have no idea how long it takes to get everything together! I hardly ever get articles in on time, there’s hundreds of HTML lines to script, pictures to find, servers to mend, and I’ve got to have a life as well! In fact… no, I had no life! (<i>He turns to YS3.</i>) You thieving BLEEP!! You stole my life! (<i>With a scream he throws himself at the magazine, sending them both crashing to the ground, and tries to throttle it. Security are still busy with Bob, and cannot get there in time. The two stay locked at each other’s throats until the life is drained from them both. Their two forms rest prone side-by-side.</i>)
<br><br>
<font color="#3f3fff"><b>Terry:</b></font> Well, obviously I’m no psychologist, but I think that if we all gave each other a little more space, and talked rather than resorting to violence, the world would be a much better place. Thank you for watching, and tune in tomorrow when we’ll be re-uniting victims and aggressors of attempted murders. But for now, take care of yourselves, and each other! (<i>The credits roll as the studio goes to black and the audience applaud once again.</i>)
