<font color="#3f3fff"><b>Terry:</b></font> Good morning ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the show. I’m your host, Terry Singer, bringing you another true-to-life account in our studio discussion today. The subject of our discussion today is family members that haven’t been seen in years. We are going to reunite some stray children and parents right here this morning, re-forming families which have fallen apart. <font color="#125453">(<i>Some “awwww”s can be heard from the audience. One lady bursts out crying.</i>)</font> First, let us tell you the sorry tale of Bob.
<br><br>
<font color="#125453">(<i>Everyone looks up to the projector screen on the stage as the lights dim and a pre-recorded film starts rolling. As the titles fade, YS3’s own </i>Bob<i> is talking to the camera.</i>)</font>
<br><br>
<font color="#ff0000"><b>Bob:</b></font> My name’s Bob, and I haven’t seen my parents in… ooh… must be twenty-five years now. Sure, we weren’t a perfect family, everyone has their problems. But we stuck together, you know?<br><br>

They are all smiling, it’s a summer day twenty-five years ago and </i>Bob<i> is standing between </i>Nathan<i> and </i>Jon<i>, each having a hand on his shoulders.</i>)</font><br><br>
Even when things weren’t so good. And then (<i>He swallows back a sob as his eyes start to water</i>), one day, they were just gone. I never saw them again. They just… left. I… I tried looking for them but I couldn’t find them anywhere. The phone had been disconnected, my e-mails were never answered and no-one was there when I went to the house. <font color="#125453">(<i>He smiles grimly</i>)</font> I’ve been going every day now for twenty-four years now, at half-past four each afternoon. It was the last time that we… that I… <font color="#125453">(<i>His emotions are obviously getting the better of him as he struggles to speak</i>)</font> … I’m sorry, can we stop now? <font color="#125453">(<i>He looks to one side and bites his knuckles.</i>)</font>  I don’t think… <font color="#125453">(<i>The camera remains on the distraught penguin for a few more poignant seconds before the film fades to black.</i>)</font>
