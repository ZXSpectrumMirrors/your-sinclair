<!-- START -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">7th December 2000</FONT></b> : <a href="index.htm">Christmas Card animation</a> put up, and set up the <a href="movies/index.htm">Movies Archive</a> so that anyone can view any movie that's appeared on this site. Also added stand-alone Windows EXEs that play these movies so that non-Flash users can see them.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">5th November 2000</FONT></b> : <a href="links.htm">Links</a> page updated, with a link to the <a href="http://www.redrival.com/spectrum/home.html">The ZX Spectrum Golden Years</a> added.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">15th October 2000</FONT></b> : <a href="guestbook.htm">Guestbook</a> reinstated.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">8th October 2000</FONT></b> : After spending a couple of years scanning articles, I thought that it was about time that I started doing some of my own, so I've done <a href="articles/Nick_Humphries_index.htm">a few reviews</a> of the early YS cover games. <a href="http://www.ys3.co.uk/">YS3</a> has been added to the list of Associated Sites, for reasons that will become apparent later.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>COMING SOON...</B> The first full YSRnRY Java game: YS HyperCapers.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">24th September 2000</FONT></b> : Some more articles added: the whole of <a href="ys21.htm">YS21</a>; Nat Cross (of <a href="http://www.ys3.co.uk/">YS3</a> fame - latest issue of which is online NOW!) has typed up the short story <a href="articles/newmorning.htm">New Morning</a> which appeared in <a href="ys40.htm">YS40</a>; and Alan Maxwell has added the <a href="articles/ccommand-preview.htm">Carrier Command preview</a> and the <a href="articles/ragehard1288.htm">Rage Hard! review of MGT's TwoFace</a>.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">22nd September 2000</FONT></b> : <a href="search.htm">Search engine</a> reinstated properly, using the free search engine provided by <a href="http://www.freefind.com">FreeFind</a>. Many thanks to Adam Thompson for letting me know about this service - all you have to do is submit your site to it, and it spiders your site immediately. Top stuff!<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">5th September 2000</FONT></b> : <font color="red"><b>We've been plugged!</b></font> David Wilson, now Head of PR at Sony, recommended this site in the 1st Sept 2000 issue of MCV trade magazine. You'll find a scan of it in the <a href="kudos.htm">Kudos</a> page. Many thanks go to Leigh Loveday for spotting and scanning it for me.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<IMG SRC="articles/bigwos.gif" ALT="Downloads" ALIGN="right"><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">2nd September 2000</FONT></b> : Some minor updates. The <a href="stats/monthly.htm">Stats section</a> has been revamped. A bit of news from an ex-YS writer: Phil South is now currently producing the Internet movie <a href="http://www.zombiesatemybrain.co.uk">Zombies Ate My Brain</a>! Also the search-for-a-game icon (right) has been altered to make its function more obvious.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">27th August 2000</FONT></b> : <b><font color=red>200,000 UP!!</font></b><br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<a href="hurdieho.htm"><IMG SRC="java/hurdieho/hurdiehosmall.gif" ALT="HURDIE HO!" ALIGN="RIGHT"></a><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">16th August 2000</FONT></b> : This site is <b><u><i>THREE YEARS OLD TODAY!!</i></u></b>. To, erm, "celebrate", here's <a href="hurdieho.htm">The Speaking Swedish Speccy</a> for you to play about with :) You'll need Java and a sound card. More updates to the site to come, just have to write a few site maintenance scripts before hand because of the new webserver.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">31st July 2000</FONT></b> : Moved to a new server. You'll know this by now :) Basically the website topped 50Mb and ClaraNET wanted it trimmed down, so I moved it to another server, using <a href="http://www.webaxxs.com">WebAxxs</a>, and I now have 400Mb at my fingertips, plus CGI, plus all sorts of other goodies! The move was a quick one - only about an hour's downtime on the old site as I removed the site and put in the redirect pages. The only noticeable problem is that there's no guestbook, but that will change soon. Also, the Search page still relates to the old site - use this to find a page, and follow the redirection. Once this new server has been spidered I'll make sure it works properly. Any problems, then <a href="email.htm">Email me</a>.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">23rd July 2000</FONT></b> : Various minor updates to the site, and added <a href="http://www.retrospec.co.uk/">RetroSpec</a> to the <a href="links.htm">Links</a> page (at long last - they've only been around for over a year or so...).<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">18th July 2000</FONT></b> : Just clearing out things which have been due for upload for a while now. There's more to come, but 63 articles have been added (index of which <a href="articles/newarticles.htm">here</a> - basically filling in gaps for <a href="ys23.htm">YS23</a>, <a href="ys24.htm">YS24</a>, <a href="ys37.htm">YS37</a>, <a href="ys38.htm">YS38</a>, <a href="ys47.htm">YS47</a> and <a href="ys48.htm">YS48</a>). There are still more to come. Meanwhile, the site is now averaging over <b><i>500</i></b> individual visitors a day!<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">12th July 2000</FONT></b> : There are more articles coming (at least fifty), but have just finished my first Java game! OK, so it's not YS related, but this one is a warm-up for my next one which most definitely <i>is</i>!. To see it, go to the <a href="/wipeout/index.htm">WipeOut!</a> page.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">18th June 2000</FONT></b> : Started scanning articles again. There are a whole load to come, but there are 52 new ones uploaded, rounding off the main review sections of <a href="ys25.htm">YS25</a>, <a href="ys26.htm">YS26</a>, <a href="ys35.htm">YS35</a> and <a href="ys36.htm">YS36</a>. Many many more to come. That lot includes a review of the doomed <a href="articles/pc200review.htm">PC 200</a> as well.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You'll find a very simple list of the new articles <a href="articles/newarticles.htm">here</a>.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Later:</i> Finally added Crashed fanzine to <a href="inputoutput.htm">Input/Output</a>. The mag's well worth a look if you still use a Spectrum.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Later still:</i> <a href="banners.htm">Banners page</a> added. You can pinch any of the banners on this page to use as link graphics on your own website.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">10th June 2000</FONT></b> : The "YS Complete Guides To..." series has finally been added! (Only took me a year to get around to doing it...) Every guide can be accessed via the relevant issue, or by using the above Contents section. All games covered in the Complete Guides are crosslinked with the whole of the archive, so wherever you see the <IMG SRC="guide.gif" ALT="G"> symbol, click it to get to the relevant guide. Oh, and feel free to laugh at my feeble icon drawing skills :)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many thanks to Softy Nonowt for allowing me to pinch the bulk of the text from his <a href="http://www.nonowt.demon.co.uk">archive</a><br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->

<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">16th April 2000</FONT></b> : <b><font color=red>150,000 UP!!!</font></b> Another milestone notched up, with 50,000 visitors coming to this site over the last four or five months. No site update yet - just been too busy with other things. Hopefully things will have settled down towards the end of May and I can start working on the site again.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">22nd March 2000</FONT></b> : <a href="inputoutput.htm">Input/Output</a> page added - a list of groups that still support the Sinclair and SAM computers.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->

<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">19th March 2000</FONT></b> : Tidied up the article sidebars in the issue summary pages, and also tidied up how the scans are handled.<br>

<!-- MIDDLE -->

Many thanks go to Martijn for storing the scans for me!<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">13th February 2000</FONT></b> : <a href="bycompany/index.htm">Company softographies</a> added to the site. Added links to every article to the respective company and reviewer index pages.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">10th February 2000</FONT></b> : <b>IT'S HERE!!!</b> The first proper site update for 2000. The site compilation scripts have been rewritten. (It used to take over eight hours to compile the site. Thanks to a complete redesign, it now only takes four <i>minutes</i>.) There are <b>45</b> new articles, bringing up the total to 636. Andrew West has VERY kindly provided 19 of them - you'll find them in YS issues 73 to 75. Also, each game is now fully cross-referenced, so at the end of each game article, you'll find a complete history of the games featured in the article. This will eventually be made fully comprehensive, but since this update has been delayed long enough as it is, I thought you'd like to see the new material first :)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You'll find a simple index of the new articles <a href="articles/newarticles.htm">here</a>.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">20th January 2000</FONT></b> : Still no site update - it's coming! - but have just updated the <a href="seeking.htm">Desperately Seeking...</a> page so that it shows the full list of ex-YS writers that I'm still trying to locate.

<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">1st January 2000</FONT></b> : <b><font color=red>HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!</font></b> No site update just yet (wait a couple of weeks).
