<!-- START -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">19th December 1999</FONT></b> : Screenshot added to the review of <a href="articles/thegreatgianasisters.htm">The Great Giana Sisters</a>. The game was never released due to legal battles with Nintendo and real screenshots are like gold dust.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expect a good sized site update some time around New Year's Day.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">26th November 1999</FONT></b> : The YS Movie is now online!!! You can <a href="movies/bond.htm">view it online (1.75Mb)</a> or <a href="movies/bond.zip">offline (939k)</a>. Let me know what you think, but I think you'll like it! Just make sure you have four minutes handy :)<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">23rd November 1999</FONT></b> : <b><font color=red>100,000 UP!!</font></b><br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">20th November 1999</FONT></b> : It's been a while coming, but the new YS Movie is <b>almost</b> here. I've put up some trailers for it on the <a href="cover.htm">entrance page</a> for a taste of things to come. The new movie itself is uploaded this Friday, 10pm London time.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">25th September 1999</FONT></b> : Banner graphic for December issues changed to a better one.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>COMING SOON... WEEKEND OF 26TH NOVEMBER...</b> The YS Movie sequel...<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">24th September 1999</FONT></b> : <a href="http://www.icwhen.com/eyesite.html"><IMG SRC="icwawd99.gif" ALT="IC-WHEN 1999 Award" BORDER=0 ALIGN=right></a>Search engine changed from ClaraNET's to <a href="http://www.altavista.com">AltaVista</a>'s since ClaraNET's has been broken for a couple of months now. Also, this site has just been given an Eye Site Award! (Hence the rather large graphic on the front page :))<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">12th September 1999</FONT></b> : In the final bit of making the front page more dynamic, a Java scroller is added to the top of the page displaying news from this month in the past few years, plus a few quotes about the site. I used the free ProScroll Java applet, adapting the program slightly to handle separate text files for each month, and also so that it always uses a specified image as a separator. At the moment, the only other dynamic features I want to put into the site is automatic changing of graphics so that when Advent/Christmas comes, it'll display the Christmas graphics (once I've created them) automatically.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">11th September 1999</FONT></b> : Minor change - the YS banner at the top of site internal pages now changes automatically every month using a bit of JavaScript. Browsers which cannot handle JavaScript shouldn't notice any change :) (Apologies to Netscape 3 users for any mess at the top of the page because the browser has a bug - Netscape 4 doesn't have any problems)<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">10th September 1999</FONT></b> : 25 more screenshots added, courtesy of Andy Kavanagh. Java calendar added to front page, which will double as an Advent calendar when the time comes.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">6th September 1999</FONT></b> : 168 screenshots added, bringing the total up to a staggering 1,077! Many thanks to Richard Llewellyn Smith for supplying a few of them.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">30th August 1999</FONT></b> : <A href="author.htm">About the webmaster</a> page added, just in case you're wondering who I am :)<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">29th August 1999</FONT></b> : <a href="screenswanted.htm">Screenshots Campaign</a> started. The YSRnRY needs your help - we want as many screenshots as we can. As a start, over 100 screens have been added, courtesy of me, Simon Cooke, Stewart Edgar, Graham Goring, Andrew Collier, Brent Cartwright, Si Owen amd Erik Kunze. Also, the <a href="ys93.htm">YS93</a> entry has been updated now that I've got hold of a copy. Does anyone have a copy of YS92 that they want to sell me?<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">8th August 1999</FONT></b> : <a href="stats/monthly.htm">Stats section</a> split up by year, plus various updates and tweaks.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="kudos.htm">Kudos page</a> updated.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">1st August 1999</FONT></b> : <a href="stats/monthly.htm">July access stats</a> added, plus touched up the <a href="photos/index.htm">Photos Section</a>.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also added the <a href="seeking.htm">Desperately Seeking...</a> page. This page contains the Top Ten YS writers that I'm trying to track down so I can secure their permission to include their articles on this site. If you know where any of them are, please <A href="email.htm">email me</a>.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">25th July 1999</FONT></b> : <a href="photos/page1.htm">The Photos They Wanted To Forget!</a> See Macca being sexy! Marcus Berkmann and Snouty in drag! Nat Pryce and Jonathan Davies before they joined YS! Lots of T'zer pics! And much much more! There are over 50 photos there, so many that you'll think you're listening to the Vision On theme whilst browsing through them. In fact, if you have a Real Audio player, you CAN have the Vision On theme playing as you view the photos!<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">16th July 1999</FONT></b> : Added a link to <a href="http://www.ys3.connectfree.co.uk/index.html">YS3</a> to the <a href="links.htm">Links page</a>. This retro-mag is well worth a read.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">4th July 1999</FONT></b> : Some minor fixes to the cover page - ta to Matthew Wilson for spotting those. A link to the <a href="http://www.mjwilson.demon.co.uk/crash/">Crash: The Online Edition</a> site added to the <a href="links.htm">Links section</a>. (Coincidence? You decide ;))<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">3rd July 1999</FONT></b> : <font color=red>The long-awaited revamp!</font> The site's had a bit of a makeover - it hadn't been redesigned since it was first uploaded two years ago, during which time the site has grown beyond all recognition. Also I thought it could look a bit more glossy than it used to. The end result is a better looking site that's easier to navigate. Take a look around this page to see the major feature changes, and also the bits that were chopped off the original cover page to make it a lot smaller and to-the-point. I hope you like the redesign - <a href="email.htm">send me your comments</a>.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">6th June 1999</FONT></b> : Browser stats added to the <a href="stats/monthly.htm">Stats Section</a>.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">2nd June 1999</FONT></b> : <a href="cover1.htm#search">Search facility</a> added! Should prove useful... The site's about to have a revamp - please email me any suggestions for improvements/features.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, the WOS search links have been improved so that they're more accurate.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">1st June 1999</FONT></b> : Site access stats section added. Now you can view various stats for either <a href="stats/monthly.htm">last month</a> or <a href="stats/all.htm">for all time</a>.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">18th May 1999</FONT></b> : <b><font color=red>50,000 UP!!</font></b> - the site has just had its 50,000th visitor. Birrova milestone, wouldn't you say?!<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">16th May 1999</FONT></b> : After a long break, finally added a load of background images for the issue summary pages. All pages now look more glossy, bar about a dozen. Done my final twiddling with the YS Movie - decided to go for maximum quality rather than fastest-possible loading.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">3rd May 1999</FONT></b> : Twiddled about with the <a href=cover.htm>YS Movie</a>. It now should run perfectly with a 28.8k connection, but people with slower modems will still have to cache it. It's still in Shockwave Flash format, but if anyone has QuickTime 4 Pro, can you convert it to a streaming Quicktime format for me?<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">10th April 1999</FONT></b> : Finally added screenshots for YS30. Animation page changed to be a little more informative (animation itself due to be ported to Quicktime in due course). Site now has it's own email address (nick@ysrnry.co.uk - imaginative, eh?).<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">21st March 1999</FONT></b> : Introducing... <a href="cover.htm">YS - The Movie</a>! You probably saw it on the way in, That animation means that this page (the "cover page") has now moved to cover1.htm from cover.htm, so update any bookmarks/subscriptions you have set on your web browser. Apologies to all those who cannot view Shockwave files, but that's the only page which contains any Shockwave, so you haven't lost anything.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">13th March 1999</FONT></b> : WOS links changed again after the site's second move inside a month, this time due to lamers abusing the site. *sigh*<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">28th February 1999</FONT></b> : WOS links fixed.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">20th February 1999</FONT></b> : 30,000 UP! I know it's a couple of days late, but just thought I'd make a note of this visitor mile stone, especially as this site seems to have attracted 10,000 visitors since the New Year. Yep, seven weeks to get half the amount of visitors I got the previous 15 months! Also I better tell you that due to the site-moving of World Of Spectrum, the WoS links probably don't work. This site will be updated with the new features in the next few days.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<a href="http://directory.mozilla.org/Computers/Operating_Systems/Sinclair/Magazines/"><img src="coolstar.gif" width=143 height=46 border=0 align=right></a> <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">8th February 1999</FONT></b> : And now a minor change - on 19th January, this site was designated a Cool Site in the Netscape Open Directory, hence the icon at the top of the index page.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also reprocessed the articles to use the new InfoSeek search engine.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">7th February 1999</FONT></b> : A pretty major (for me) format change to the issue summary pages - to take advantage of the new Infoseek search engine on World Of Spectrum, I've changed all the search links so that they use it. Why is this a format change? Well, I can now ditch the form-type buttons and use proper links, eliminating the unsightly blank lines between each entry!!! Many thanks to Martijn van der Heide for introducing this feature for me, now the issue summary pages look as I intended them to look.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A nice by-product of these changes is that the issue summary pages are now Lynx-friendly, making the whole site reasonably readable for Lynx users.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will be the last site update for a while - I'm changing jobs and moving house, so spare time will be a bit short. Still to come are the YS30 screenshots from Paul Jenkinson, plus changing all the search links from the game reviews pages (done the script changes, but an eight-hour long build at the moment cannot be done). After that, who knows?<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">9th January 1999</FONT></b> : <FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">FINALLY!!!</FONT> The big update I've been promising for absolutely <i>ages</i>! OK, the changes one-by-one:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>112 new articles</b> - Go to this simple <a href="articles/newindex.htm">index page</a> which lists them all.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>All articles cross-referenced</b> - If a game review that's on this site also has a corresponding re-release or inclusion in a compilation, there'll be a link to it at the end of the review. Take a look at the <a href="articles/historyinthemaking.htm">History In The Making</a> review as an example.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Compilations and re-releases reviewed</b> - since some original reviews are unscannable, I've tried to fill in the gaps using re-release reviews and compilation reviews, which you can see when you click on the <IMG SRC="rr.gif" ALT="R-R"> and <IMG SRC="comp.gif" ALT="COMP"> icons respectively. These reviews are also indexed in the <a href="articles/index.htm">index pages</a>.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Compilation search links</b> - At the start of every compilation review, there's a set of World Of Spectrum search buttons which allow you to search for snapshots of individual games on the compilation.<br><IMG SRC="tape.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Cover Tape links</b> - When you see the Cover Tape icon (right) in the issue summary pages, clicking on it will take you to the World Of Spectrum's cover tape archive. Good innit?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Joystick Jugglers updated</b> - I've started to include people in the <a href="jugglers/index.htm">Joystick Jugglers</a> section who reviewed games for YS before the Jugglers section was established. So far it just covers T'zer, Max Phillips and Sara Biggs. If anyone can point me to the locations of photos for the people who haven't got photos yet I'd be most grateful.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Megagames Page</b> - All the YS Megagames in <a href="megagames.htm">one huge page</a>, complete with review, WoS and screenshot links.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Screenshots</b> - Paul Jenkinson returns with screenshots for issues 26 to 28.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tweaks</b> - Miscellaneous tweaks to the various scripts and formatters.<p>Current stats for the site: 591 articles (553 reviews, 38 other articles) and 778 screenshots. Comments about the new changes very welcome - email me at nick@ysrnry.co.uk.<br>
