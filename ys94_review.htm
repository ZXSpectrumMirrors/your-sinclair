<br>
In the
beginning was the Speccy. And everyone saw that it was good. And then
came <I>Your Spectrum</I>, which pleased many a boffin, yet was
missing that <I>je ne sais quoi </I>-
you could tell that it knew the sort of mag it wanted to be, yet felt
shackled to the more serious tone set by the first few issues of <I>Your
Spectrum</I>. So, with the arrival of the QL and the promise of more
machines to come (like the Loki and the Pandora Portable), the <I>YS</I>
team took the opportunity to rebrand the magazine to <I>Your
Sinclair</I>, focus a lot more on
the games, and a legend was born.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really. You can see the <I>YS</I> influence in many of the magazines
written and published over the past fifteen years, all trying to get
that balance of humour, news and irrelevance that made the classic
magazine so well-loved. After all, with <I>YS</I> peaking at over
80,000 readers and leading the Spectrum magazine circulation wars
from part-way into its life to the very end where it outlasted all
others, this was surely a golden formula that the magazine publishers
of today would wish to emulate.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, <I>YS</I> ran for nine years, up until 1993 in fact, by
which time all the major software houses had moved their resources to
either the consoles or the 16-bit machines which were then being sold
at entry-level prices. Issue 93, the September 1993 edition, was
christened &quot;The Big Final Issue&quot;, and became the tribute
issue to formally round off the <I>YS</I> run. It was a damned good
read, too, and a lot of effort went into it with things like
look-backs over its lifetime, a staff reunion (which revealed a lot
more insight into how much people enjoyed working for <I>YS</I>), and
then a handover to the next generation of Speccy gaming with a
concluding review of the fanzines available and the Spectrum
emulators you could download for your nextgen machines.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a work of art, a fitting end to a fine magazine. Reading it
still brings a tear to my eye. The other issues that came out in 1992
and 1993 also brought a tear to my eye, but for very different
reasons, not least of which was witnessing the slow death of the
Speccy scene.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone thought they'd seen the last of it. The Your Sinclair
Rock'n'Roll Years was created as both a memorial and a celebration of
the magazine. YS3 all too briefly revived the formula that more
professional and experienced writers and publishers failed to grasp,
but that too has now passed on.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then something wonderful happened.<br>

<br>
<I><B>It's
alive!!</B></I><br>

Over the past fifteen years, many Speccy gamers had transformed into
Speccy retrogamers, playing old games using emulators on their
current machines, from PCs down to even games consoles. Amstrad's
current <I>eM@iler</I> product allows you to play Speccy games on
demand, and it's only a matter of time before Amstrad wakes up and
produces a joystick you plug directly into your TV which will allow
you to play preloaded games again on a big screen. Speccy gamers
aren't alone in retrogaming - masses of other people who used other
machines also do the same, although it's arguable that the Speccy
retro scene is significantly better developed than any other
platform.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>ZX Format</I> has capitalized on this, and the fine magazine is
released three times a year. It's not <I>YS</I>, but is a damned good
read regardless. The popularity of <I>ZXF</I>, together with the
various retro columns popping up in mainstream computer magazines all
over the place, finally convinced Live Publishing to take a gamble
and produce a magazine dedicated to retrogaming, imaginatively naming
it <I>RetroGamer</I>. No one knew how popular it would be - was
retrogaming a niche thing that would only appeal to spods on the
internet, or was there genuine mainstream appeal there? The first
issue was released intending to be a quarterly magazine, as demand
couldn't possibly be high enough for something more frequent, surely?
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All copies sold out. Within a very few issues, <I>RG</I> went from
quarterly, to every two months, to every six weeks, until finally
plumping to become a fully-fledged monthly magazine. A true success
story, and well-deserved as you can see that the <I>RG</I> writers
really do love their subject, and most of the articles literally ooze
infectious enthusiasm. And with the editor Martyn Caroll being a
strong Speccy fan, you were guaranteed good coverage for that
machine.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being editor obviously has its perks - close to one year into the
run of <I>RG</I> and something utterly wonderful happens: Martyn
decides to bring back <I>YS</I>.<br>

<br>

<B>YS <I>is back and still number one for Spectrum games!</I></B><br>
Whilst
<I>RG</I> was a gamble for Live
Publishing, it really was just gambling with money. If the magazine
failed then it would sink without a trace and be quickly forgotten.
Bringing back <I>YS</I>,
however, is a completely different kettle of fish - you were gambling
with the hearts and minds of hundreds and thousands of Spectrum fans
who held <I>YS</I> close to
their hearts, mine included. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
saw the first <I>YS</I>
rip-off: the later issues of <I>Crash</I>.
Starved of sales yet refusing to bring in some new faces and new
ideas to reinvigorate the fading magazine, the Powers That Be at
Newsfield Publications decided to go the whole hog in trying to
reproduce the <I>YS</I> formula,
starting with the design of the magazine right down to the tone and
writing style of its editorial. It was horrible. Truly awful. The
gamble didn't pay off and soon Newsfield went out of business, <I>Crash</I>
surviving for a few months at a spin-off publisher before being
&quot;merged&quot; with rival mag <I>Sinclair User</I>. 
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other publishers ignored <I>Crash's</I> fate and tried to reproduce
the <I>YS</I> formula in new titles for the new machines and games
consoles, even going as far as recruiting a few ex-<I>YS</I> writers.
The end-result was usually a different animal to <I>YS</I>, although
usually not the abomination that <I>Crash </I>became. Two notable
titles at the time were exceptions: <I>PC Zone </I>and <I>Arcade</I>.
They were quality magazines in their time and shared the same balance
between humour and information that <I>YS</I> had in its editorial,
although they'd minimized or completely eradicated the 100% silly
bits that <I>YS</I> enjoyed.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's not to imply that <I>YS</I> itself was flawless. From 1991
onwards the flow of new Spectrum games was slowing down alarmingly
rapidly to a trickle and this had two knock-on effects on <I>YS</I>:
decreasing advertising revenue to subsidise the number of pages
possible in the mag, and a dramatic drop in the number of things to
write about to fill those pages once they'd been paid for. The
magazine's focus flipped 180-degrees from being little funny bits
wrapped up inside editorial to little bits of editorial wrapped up
inside funny bits. With the funny bits taking up more and more of the
mag, that naturally required more and more new funny material, and
soon enough many of the funny bits appeared to be increasingly forced
and contrived. Whilst aiming to maintain the <I>YS</I> formula whilst
simultaneously filling in the gaps in the mag with silly stuff, the
later <I>YS</I> teams lost sight of what worked and the mag, in my
opinion, suffered for it. Sure, there were still plenty of gems
within the later mags, but the silly bits really did appear to be
just padding. For me, the <I>YS</I> in 1992 and 1993 just wasn't the
<I>YS</I> I knew during the 1980's.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So,
once I'd seen that even <I>YS</I>
couldn't reproduce the <I>YS</I>
formula anymore, I had little confidence that anyone else could pull
it off. As a result, when anyone came up with the idea to petition
Future Publishing to bring back <I>YS</I>
in some form or another, my responses ranged from cautiousness to
outright dismissive. I grew up with <I>YS</I>
between the ages of twelve and seventeen, and it meant a lot to me. I
was a complete fanboy, reading and re-reading each issue for many
years to come. It was only when I got bored of lugging out all my <I>YS</I>
binders to read the mags that I came up with the idea of putting it
on the web in some form or another, and the Your Sinclair Rock'n'Roll
Years was born. The response I got from the website showed me people
still enjoyed <I>YS</I> to
this day, and so when I heard that <I>RetroGamer</I>
was bringing it back as a special one-off supplement I was both
excited and incredibly wary. Would they succeed where others had
failed? And if they didn't pull it off, then they surely could expect
to lose a fair few readers who'd be offended at seeing a poor
imitation under the <I>YS</I>
name.<br>
<br>
<I><B>I
never knew there was so much in it!</B></I><br>

They've pulled it off. You cannot possibly know how relieved I felt
to discover that.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But first things first. This isn't the <I>YS</I> you knew and loved
from the 1980's. Times change, and people change too. Back then <I>YS</I>
was aimed to people like me who were thirteen in 1987, and I'm now
thirty in 2004. <I>YS94</I> is aimed at the latter category, and is a
better thing for it. Gone are many of the in-jokes, and the <I>YS</I>
Lingo is also minimised. But the <I>YS</I> formula is not only
preserved, it's also evolved so that it's relevant to us twenty- and
thirty-somethings, not some spotty teenager with an attention span of
a goldfish.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the moment you open it you are gobsmacked just how well they've
recaptured the <I>YS</I> spirit. 
The design that they've gone for is borrowed heavily from the <I>YS</I>
of 1990, and boy does it hit home. When I first opened the mag I
didn't have time to actually <I>read</I>
any of it, so just flicked through checking out the look and feel.
I'm not exaggerating when I tell you that I was repeating over and
over &quot;oh-my-god-oh-my-god-oh-my-god-oh-my-god-oh-my-god...&quot;
as I turned each page. Even the cover looked as if it could have been
used in the original <I>YS</I>. The
only thing wrong with the look is that the paper used in the cover is
your regular in-mag-page-type paper, and also the ink comes off the
pages onto your fingers far too easily. A thicker cover and faster
ink would be in order should they decide to do this sort of thing
again.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's funny, and we're talking laugh-out-loud funny, too. The humour
<I>feels</I> like <I>YS</I>. It even brought back memories  of buying
and reading the original. One thing I've missed out on is getting
<I>YS94</I> by mail. If you went to a newsagent for the latest
<I>RetroGamer</I> you'll find the mag bagged together with new <I>YS</I>.
Depending on how slap-handed the shelf-stacker put the mags on the
shelf, chances are you'd be greeted with the <I>YS</I> cover facing
you as you enter the newsagents. I've been told it's like the 1980's
all over again.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't think of this new issue as a new issue of the &quot;regular&quot;
<I>YS</I>, or you'll be disappointed. Of the 30 pages within the mag,
twelve of them are filled with nostalgic reminiscing by the <I>YS</I>
and <I>RG</I> teams. But in the remaining eighteen pages you'll find
Pssst, Reviews, a MegaPreview, Future Shocks, Joystick Jugglers,
Tipshop,  and Program Pitstop - featuring the BASIC listing of
<I>Advanced Lawnmower Simulator</I>! There's even a pseudo-cover tape
on the <I>RG</I> CD containing <I>YS</I> classics <I>Batty </I>and
<I>Moley Christmas</I>, plus playable demos of new Spectrum games
<I>More Tea, Vicar?</I> and <I>Sensitive</I>. Thankfully, unlike the
original <I>YS,</I> they only spend a quarter of a page describing
them, rather than the obligatory half-forest that later issues of <I>YS</I>
used to pad out the mag with.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other thing that worried me
about a <I>YS</I> revival was what &quot;era&quot; would be chosen -
the <I>YS</I> in 1984, 1989 and 1993 were very different animals in
character. Also, what ex-<I>YS</I> people would be brought in? A real
disappointment would be if they brought in some of the more obscure
members of the <I>YS</I> team. Thankfully <I>RetroGamer</I> has
delivered in spades. Phil South writes a good look-back piece, and
together with Matt Bielby, Teresa Maughan, David McCandless, Mike
Gerrard, Marcus Berkmann and Jonathan Davies also take part in
duplicate mini-interviews about their times at <I>YS</I>, what they
liked about the Speccy, and what they've been doing since. I'm
especially pleased that Phil, Marcus and T'zer were on-board in this
project - the whole <I>YS</I> formula and character was mainly down
to them and it would have been downright insulting if <I>RG</I>
didn't get them to take part. 
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it's inevitable that some <I>YS</I> writers weren't even
asked to be involved in this project. There's a slim-to-fair chance
that they could be reading this, so here's my take on the situation.
First of all, space is an issue. It's a crap excuse, it's also the
default excuse used by publishers, but as <I>YS94</I> was only 32
pages it's also a persuasive excuse. Secondly, there's the choice of
era. If writers where chosen spanning the whole life of <I>YS</I>
(nine years) then <I>YS94</I> would have been formed in a hodgepodge
of different styles and approaches. The mag wouldn't have felt
self-consistent. Finally, <I>YS94</I> was aimed mainly at ex-<I>YS
</I>readers, but also other retrogamers, therefore it makes sense to
me that they focussed on those people who were writing for the mag
during its heyday when it was getting over 80,000 readers a month -
that would be 1988, and the writers eventually chosen reflect that
choice. I know how disappointed some ex-<I>YS</I> writers will be
when they realise they weren't asked to get involved with <I>YS94</I>,
but I hope they understand the choices <I>RetroGamer</I> made.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The editorial of <I>YS94</I> was written by <I>RG</I> staff plus one
notable addition - Colin Woodcock, editor of <I>ZX Format</I>, who
continues to impress me. Reviews are done usual the traditional Final
Verdict ratings box, complete with thermometer. It would be unfair to
critique individual articles, so I'll summarise by saying that most
of them are written in the <I>YS</I> style (although updated a bit as
mentioned earlier), however one of the five game reviews looks like
it's just been lifted from <I>RetroGamer's</I> news pages as it just
provides information about a game but no actual opinion about how
well it plays. And the Joystick Jugglers images are digital
transformations of images rather than Nick Davies drawings, but that
also is just me being picky.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pssst is hilarious. In the original <I>YS</I> it could sometimes be
hit-and-miss, especially when there's very little news to report.
This got both the balance and the humour spot-on. Tipshop is written
in true <I>YS</I> style, although at one point the humour wanders
into slightly-dodgy territory. The content is fully authentic, having
come out of The Tipshop website - I had a very small hand in the
choice of games they covered by producing the most popular requests
at time of writing. Future Shocks feels truly authentic.<br>

<br>
<I><B>Our
work is done - for now</B></I><br>

It's a fine piece of work - the only other downside is <I>RetroGamer's</I>
penchant for sticking in pixellated images and scaling them up a
little too much. You'll especially see this with the old Joystick
Jugglers images. Plus once or twice <I>RG</I> look like they're
padding out the mag a bit by filling large chunks of pages with
single images - a common <I>RG</I> flaw that is used in their regular
mag, but these really are minor niggles that distract you from the
fact that they've done the improbable: they've reproduced the <I>YS</I>
look and feel. I cannot recommend this highly enough, you really must
buy issue 9 of <I>RetroGamer</I> even if it is just to get this <I>YS</I>
supplement.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now comes the question that is a big one: should there be a
second <I>YS</I> supplement? 
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's a more complex question than you think.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First thing you have to remember is that about a third of the
current supplement is look-back stuff - you can only do that once, so
you'd need to fill up those pages somehow. The good thing is that the
reviews and previews are spot-on, so they could be used to fill that
gap, plus things like hardware reviews and suchlike.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there's a second issue to consider: frequency between
supplements. Whilst there is activity in the Speccy retrogaming scene
producing new software and hardware, it's done at a slow pace. This
is, after all, a hobby and not a career choice. <I>ZX Format</I> is
released every four months and has plenty of high-quality stuff,
however it doesn't have the same exposure that <I>RetroGamer</I> has.
Thankfully Colin Woodcock has a foot in both camps, so in theory
could repackage <I>ZXF</I> content in a <I>YS</I> sort of way.
Cutting out all the emulator stuff which won't appeal to your average
<I>RG</I> reader, I think there's scope for an annual <I>YS</I>
supplement, keeping it at 32 pages each. This avoids overkill and
also hopefully prevents any burn-out and overstretching of the <I>YS</I>
formula.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, from a cynical <I>YS</I> fanatic, <I>YS94</I> gets a huge
thumbs-up.
