So, Sinclair User preferred to hype the run-up to Christmas, Your
Sinclair went for fun and games, what did Crash do for Yule? Right
from the very start they decided to really push the boat out by
expanding the magazine to 200 pages and beyond, subsidising the extra
content by bumping up the cover price for that issue. Artist Oli Frey
had a field day with the festive covers producing some of the best
artwork to feature in any of the Spectrum magazines.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Crash team took their cues from the Annuals that came out at the
end of each year for other publications - what sold them was the extra
content as readers wanted something substantial to read through during
the Christmas school holidays. And so the legendary Crash Christmas
Special was born where everything was bigger, longer and uncut.

Teletext is being switched off forever, so here's a bit from Christmas Eve 1982, back in the days when it was all a lot less formal and definitely less corporate. Personally I can't get enough of these primitive graphics as it challenged the artist to get something that looks nice using them. And there's <a href="http://teletext.mb21.co.uk/gallery/ceefax/christmas/index.shtml">more where that came from</a>. <b><i>(11:00)</i></b></font><center><font size=-2 color="#ffffff"><i>Watch full-sized <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZvZNjQizMI" target="eZvZNjQizMI">at YouTube</a></font></center></TD></TR></TABLE><br></TD></TR></TABLE>

The Christmas 1984 issue was a good opening gambit with a detailed
report on the collapse of Imagine. Whilst the magazine's readership
was relatively young, the editorial team had no problems in giving
this feature five pages to itself, mostly filled with text in a rather
small font. The article is still held up as one of the great articles
written for a computer magazine during that time.

As for other 1984 content, there were annual events such as poll
results amongst Crash readers for the best titles in various
categories which were published during that year, plus
behind-the-scenes articles about how Crash is produced, as well as
regular features getting extra pages. In later issues there would be
annual lookbacks, playing tips specials, and (what may be slightly
guilty of the crime of space-filling) software indexes. The charge of
space-filling also came up in the 1985 special when nine pages were
given over to a fairly amateurish cartoon strip sent in by a reader.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That remained the rough template that later Specials would adhere to,
with the odd one-off special feature thrown in as well, such as short
stories (nice), puzzle pages (nicer) and some reviews extended to
three pages (nicest). Dotted throughout the issue would be little bits
of Christmassy art, such as mini-cartoons, or even simply putting
articles onto a snowy background and putting snow on top of the titles
of articles.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Skipping over the rather odd pseudo-fanzine which appeared in the 1987
special, we reach the stonking 212-page 1988 Special which, for an odd
reason, was published in November - apparently December was so busy
that Crash readers forgot to buy Crash during that month, putting the
extra work on creating the Special to waste. Nevertheless this formed
a substantial part of the wonderful climax to the 1988 Christmas
run-up as it was packed with reviews, fun features (the usual
template, plus an inter-magazine games challenge with other Newsfield
titles, and special puzzles and tips features, as well as three-page
reviews) - with all that space to play with the art team had a field
day with screenshots and artwork. Together with all the adverts for
the biggest games, it was everything a Christmas Special ought to be -
large, colourful, frantic and fun.

It's a nice memory to hold on to, because when the summer of 1989
came, it all turned to hell. Newsfield were having severe financial
problems and decided to turn Crash from a magazine packed full of
features into a pamphlet that accompanied a compilation tape of old
games of questionable quality.

<FONT size=-1 COLOR="#FFFF00"><b><u>1982 Channel Four</u></b></font></center><font size=-1 color="#ffffff">Channel Four's first Christmas, and look at the basic adverts!

The first pamphlet was only 32 pages, not including the cover. I was
devastated to see such a good magazine ruined like this. OK, so the
following issue was 50 pages long, but that's still a heavy drop from
the 216-page peak of a few months earlier. The targeting at a younger
audience also alienated me somewhat - lack of space meant that
features were lucky to get more than two pages.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1989 Christmas Special wasn't all that Christmassy beyond snow on
a few titles and the Crash logo on the cover. Ditto for 1990 and 1991,
after which EMAP bought the title out and "merged" it with Sinclair
User. A sad end, which could have been avoided had Newsfield got new
blood in at the top when they were running out of good ideas.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway...
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you ignore 1989 and beyond, then the Crash Christmas Special was
unmissable, regardless of whether or not you were a regular reader. I
was a late-comer to the wonders of Crash, buying my first issue in the
spring of 1988, so the Christmas Special of that year really was a
bolt out of the blue, leading me to pick up as many back issues as I
could afford. Even though I was probably only a reader for little more
than a year when Crash got pampletized, the change in format was still
highly disappointing for someone who bought computer magazines for the
articles, not for whatever games happened to be taped to the cover at
that time.
