<div><b><I><a href="outruneuropa.htm">OutRun Europa</a></I>  about to 
rev its way onto Speccys 
around the globe, so we 
plonked <I>Duncan MacDonald</I> into a Reliant 
Robin and sent him over 
to Probe to have a quick 
pre-release gander at it! </b>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conversion of the arcade classic 
<I><a href="outrun.htm">OutRun</a></I> was a bit of a disappointment 
for Spec-chums, as you probably know 
-- the problem being that the 
programmers actually tried too hard to 
be faithful to the original coin-op. Four 
hundred trillion sprites the size of 
Mount Everest was a nice idea in 
theory, but in practice even the 
renowned processing speed of the 
rubber beermat couldn't cope -- 
leaving the gameplay wallowing in 
sticky mud. The race crawled along at 
the speed of Ayers Rock (that's not 
particularly quickly) making the 32,000 
multi-loads a tiresome chore rather 
than a brief resting period between 
levels. So what of <I><a href="outruneuropa.htm">OutRun Europa</a></I>, the 
follow-up? Have the programmers 
learnt their lesson? The answer is a 
resounding 'yes indeedy' by cracko, so 
read on to see how well they've done. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>Drive On </b><br
In <I><a href="outruneuropa.htm">OutRun Europa</a></I> you're at the wheel 
of a convertible Ferrari Testrossa (like 
you were in the original <I><a href="outrun.htm">OutRun</a></I>) and 
you've still got the tasty 'chick' in the 
passenger seat, praise the Lord. <I>(That's 
nuff of that! Ed)</I> You've got a lot of 
driving in front of you though, namely 
from here in good old Blighty all the 
way to West Germany, taking in the 
'delights' of France, Italy and 
Switzerland en route. Each of the five 
countries is split into three different 
stages; rural, suburban and urban, so 
in essence we're talking 15 rip-roaring, 
hard driving levels! Yahooo! 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hacking along England's country 
lanes at hundreds of miles an hour, you 
pass hedges, trees and telephone 
boxes. Up hill, down dale, as the road 
scrolls inexorably towards you - oh 
dear, what's that up ahead? Looks a bit 
like another 'motor', a Lotus if I'm not 
mistaken -- a nifty bit of overtaking's 
in order here, I'll be bound. Blimey, he's 
moving over. Crikey, I can't get 
through. Quick, over to the other side 
of the road. Yikes -- a telephone box! 
Blaaaarrgh! Curse British Telecom! In 
fact, curse these country roads and all 
Lotus drivers -- I'll be much happier 
when I get to the city. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An hour later. Yippee, there's the 
Post Office Tower -- and there's a 
London bus. Yahoo, there's a taxi-cab, 
I'll carve him up. The infidel. Inhale my 
exhaust fumes, cabbie. Ho ho ho. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the city it's back into the 
country again, aiming for the English 
Channel and, ultimately, the Continent 
(after crossing the Channel 'Bridge' -- 
which the programmers plumped for 
instead of a tunnel in the interests of in-game speed). 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;France, aaaah. Ooh lala, the weather 
over here's a bit naff (yes, there are 
actually climatic changes in this game) 
and the rain's coming down in buckets. 
Oh look a couple of 2CV's. No mirror/indicate/manoeuvre malarkey in this 
country -- just steam past with all the 
stops pulled out, that's the only kind of 
driving they understand. Yikes, slippy 
road 'cos of the rain. I forgot. 
Blammo!! My apologies, monsieur 
'Johnny Onion'! 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>When In Rome... </b><br>
Drive through Paris, head South East 
(the weather improves in these parts) 
and you hit Italy. Bang. Oh dear, the 
drivers here are even more mental 
than they are in France, and there are 
some mean cars to go up against, like 
other Ferraris and Lamborghinis. They 
try and barge you off the road, and to 
make matters worse the weather 
closes in again. Still, go for broke, eh? 
Wheeeel Yes, yes, yes! Yes, yes, yes!
Bang! Drat!

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having negotiated the torturous 
twists and turns of the Italian 
landscape, it's time to head north 
through Switzerland where it's not only 
snowing and very slippery, but for the 
most part you're driving on mountain 
roads with a sheer drop on one side. 
Yikes. Anyway, should you make it 
through unscathed you'll find yourself 
on the final leg -- a high speed romp 
on a German autobahn. You're 
badgered by BMW's and Porsches, the 
weather's got better again but now 
you've got to get to Berlin, where the 
race ends. Good luck chum, you're 
going to need it! 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steering of the car has been 
programmed beautifully. You can 
oversteer, understeer and even pull 
yourself out of a potential skid by 
yanking the steering wheel (sorry, 
joystick) from one side to the other. Oh, 
and another nice touch is that after 
you've finished a country a passport 
pops up on screen and you get a 
stamp in it (a passport stamp, not a 19p 
postage stamp you clot). 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, it has to be said, <I><a href="outruneuropa.htm">OutRun Europa</a></I> 
looks like it's going to be the definitive 
motor-car racing game. With brilliantly 
detailed scrolling backdrops, beautiful 
road-side graphics, changing weather 
and cars that are 'intelligent' ('cos the 
Speccy remembers where they are -- 
even if they're behind you), the 
successor to <I><a href="outrun.htm">OutRun</a></I> looks like it's 
going to be everything (and more) that 
<I><a href="outrun.htm">OutRun</a></I> should have been - that's, 
erm, oh dear, I can't think of a good 
enough superlative. Hang on, I'll just 
have a look at the back of a Code 
Masters cassette inlay. Ah yes, that'll 
do. <I><a href="outruneuropa.htm">OutRun Europa</a></I> is going to be 
amazingly brilliant. Boing. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br<center><b>A CLOTS GUIDE TO HOW AND WHY</b></center><p>
<b>Why Is The Animation So Good 
In OutRun Europa? </b><br>
Animation with a pseudo 3-D 
effect relies on things in the 
distance being small and things 
close up being big. These are two 
'frames' of animation -- near and 
far. Here's an <I><a href="outruneuropa.htm">OutRun Europa</a></I> 
Beetle in the distance. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><I>[Or not, as the case may be. Imagine a very tiny car sprite - NickH]</I><br>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you put your foot down to catch 
the rogue VW up you wouldn't 
expect it to suddenly look like 
this, would you. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><I>[And image a very big car sprite here - NickH]</I><br>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless of course you closed your 
eyes for a couple of seconds, but 
that's not the kind of driving 
that's likely to get you through a 
driving test, is it now? In fact 
closing your eyes while driving at 
speed is downright dangerous. 
DON'T DO IT. Anyway, with open 
eyes you'd expect the beetle to 
get gradually bigger. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much more lifelike, n'est ce pas? 
The same thing applies to bus 
stops, telephone boxes and, well, 
everything really. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the objects in the game have 
twelve frames of animation, 
which is why everything scrolls 
smoothly towards youl 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>If There's So Much In The 
Game How Come It's Not 
Slow Like <I><a href="outrun.htm">OutRun</a></I>? </b><br>
Because programmers Probe 
learnt from the mistakes made on 
<I><a href="outrun.htm">OutRun</a></I>. Also, because this is an 
original game (not a conversion) 
Probe were able to do pretty 
much what was needed to make 
the game really playable, rather 
than just attempt to mimic a coin-op which couldn't be mimicked. 
One 'time-saving' move was to 
drop the fork in the road at the 
end of levels -- this apparently 
used up loads and loads (and 
loads) of memory space and 
added nothing much to the 
enjoyment of the game. <I><a href="outrun.htm">OutRun</a></I> 
updated its screens at something 
like four frames per second, while 
<I>Europa</I> manages ten (more than 
twice as fast) -- even with sprites 
as big as the bus to deal with.

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><I>[NB - This version of OutRun Europa was scrapped when US Gold acquired the rights to the official coin-op sequel, Turbo OutRun. OutRun Europa did eventually get released, albeit in a completely different form - NickH]</I>
