It's now Christmas Eve, and I hope your preparations for the big day
are in full swing. To be honest with you, it's the run-up to Christmas
I love most rather than the big day itself. All the lights are up in
town, in the shops and in the living room. There's plenty of rich food
and drink to gorge on which aren't normally available during the rest
of the year - although I'll never understand this country's
infatuation with currants, raisins and mincemeat. And I'm soppy enough
to believe that people are that bit nicer to each other in the run-up
to Christmas making odd bits of magic possible. The big day itself is
usually over and done with so quickly that if you blinked, you'd miss
it, whereas the run-up lasts for several weeks.

My favourite Christmas run-up back in my Spectrum days was during
1988. I was still pretty new to the Spectrum games and magazine scene,
so not only was I completely carried away by this fresh thick wave of
hype which washed over me, but I was still utterly mad about Christmas
- far too old to believe in Santa, but I was already addicted to
Christmas consumerism, so I'd pick up and keep hold of every and any
bit of Christmas marketing material I could get my hands on, starting
with the World Wildlife Fund Christmas Catalogue which would pop
through the letterbox during in July.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Games-wise, we'd never had it so good. <i>Afterburner</i>, <i>R-Type</i>, <i>Operation
Wolf</i>, <i>Robocop</i>, the second <i>Batman</i> game, <i>Savage</i>... such good games which
were far superior to what was on offer earlier in the decade. The
software labels knew how to market these as well, hyping them through
magazines via advance previews and playable demos. <i>Robocop</i> barely

It's Christmas Eve, and BBC2 signs out and closes down with a lovely wintry montage of photos and a bit of festive music. It's stuff like this which keeps me coming back to the internet day after day - there are gems like these to be found. <b><i>(2:41)</i></b></font><center><font size=-2 color="#ffffff"><i>Watch full-sized <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imF_NE9Gt5Q" target="imF_NE9Gt5Q">at YouTube</a></font></center></TD></TR></TABLE><br></TD></TR></TABLE>

registered on my radar until Crash gave away the warehouse level as a
demo, then I was instantly hooked and suddenly this stalking horse
became one of the biggest sellers on the Spectrum ever.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had also discovered computer shows, too. ZX Microfairs were pretty
small-time affairs - really just a big hall with long lines of tables
with people crowding around them. Little in the way of hype, but in
1987 I quickly found the Your Sinclair stand showing off their
soon-to-be-cover-tape game <i>Batty</i>, naturally being controlled by a
joystick that looked like a hand grenade. I think ZX Microfairs filled
a few hours quite nicely, but not really a full day. I needed
something bigger. I needed the main event. And that was held annually
at Earl's Court.

</TABLE>The PC Show 1988 was the place to go to if you wanted to see what was
coming that Christmas. Filling Earl's Court's main hall on October, it
was like being in the centre of a huge metropolis. Software labels
would spend high five-figure amounts on their stands, and they'd be
utterly massive. Some even had more than one floor, so they were
effectively building shops and offices in the middle of the
exhibition. The walls would be covered with monitors showing demos of
the games, plus jaw-droppingly high posters and banners advertising
the games. There'd be various celebrity appearances (who I'd
invariably miss, and who I couldn't remember anyway), people in
costumes looking vaguely like the characters in the games, and
top-of-the-range arcade machines on free-play practically everywhere.

</TABLE>King Of Christmas Ocean's stand was unmissable, filled with arcade
machines, freebie counters, monitors, and for the 1988 show they'd got
in a tank to advertise <i>Operation Wolf</i>. All through the hall - well, in
the games area anyway - people were packed in as heaving crowds flowed
in one direction and another, trapping and taking you with the
current. Sure, you could work your way through the tide, but you'd be
knackered once you came out the other end. The crowds, the bright
lights and the loud music had this odd disorientating effect and you
found that you really, really needed to get yourself a map so you can
find your way around this utterly gorgeously hypnotic exhibition. If
you liked hype, you were in your element, and I loved it. I only wish
I was older and less starry-eyed back then so I could have soaked it
all in rather that being blown away by it all. I still remember the
shock of walking through the entrance to the hall and seeing the sheer
vastness of the first stall I saw.

excited about what turned out to be a fantastic crop of Spectrum
games, finished off with Crash and Your Sinclair turning out their
best Christmas Specials during their whole runs. Everybody in the
industry had raised their game to make Christmas 1988 the peak the
Spectrum gaming.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I loved them for it. Spending that Christmas playing <i>Operation
Wolf</i> and <i>Robocop</i> sealed the best Christmas run-up I had ever
experienced during my Spectrum years.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope you've enjoyed this Advent Calendar, and that you didn't cheat
and eat all of the chocolates at once at the start of December. I hope
your own Christmas preparations for this year are going to plan and
that you and your family will have a Merry Christmas and a Happy New
Year.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm off to have a quick game of <i>Crisis At Christmas</i>, so see ya...
