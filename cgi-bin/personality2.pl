<br><B>TEST ONE - THE SINKING SHIP</b><br> You're the lone survivor of a sinking ship in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. There's a deserted island in the distance, one servicable lifeboat and plenty of time for you to pick eight of the many items on board your stricken vessel to take to the shore. Since the island is uninhabited you'll be totally on your own. You have no idea how long it'll be before you're rescued, if ever. Pick your eight items from the list below:

You think things through quite thoroughly, sometimes to the extent of being a bit of a boring old fart in fact. You're fairly solid and reliable, though, which is a point in anyone's favour. <i>SUMMARY</i> - Reliable, think things through before acting them out but a bit on the boring side. Loosen up (maaan). <br><b>Mostly Red (Seven Or More)</b><br> By jingo, you're a bit of a prat, aren't you? You'd survive on a desert island for about twelve minutes. You're probably rather scatterbrained and tend to think with your heart rather than your head. <i>Summary</i> - You're a bit of an emotional time-bomb, are probably a very nice person - but at the same time a little bit of a useless one. <br><b>Even Mixture Of Green And Red</b><br> Crikey, you're ever so slightly bonkers! You've probably got loads of chums though - for some reason people who are one brick short of a full load are quite popular. <i>SUMMARY</i> - You've got kangaroos in the top paddock (that's Australian for barmy). Stay away from sharp objects. <br><b>Did You Choose The Paul Daniels Bust?</b><br> Then you need psychiatric counselling! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><B>TEST TWO - YES OR NO</b><br> All you have to do is answer Yes or No to the following questions: 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<center> <TABLE> <tr><td>- Have you ever pulled the legs or wings off an insect?</td></tr> <tr><td>- Imagine you're driving a beaten up old Mini, and a "well-heeled gent" in a brand-new Mercedes is trying to get onto the busy road in front of you. Do you let him pull out?</td></tr> <tr><td>- If you see an elderly person trying to cross a very busy road, do you walk gleefully by and leave them to get on with it on their own?</td></tr> <tr><td>-If you see someone less fortunate than yourself, do you think "Ho ho! I'm glad I'm not him/her"?</td></tr> <tr><td>-Have you ever put a hamster in a microwave and set it to defrost for eight minutes?</td></tr> <tr><td>-Have you ever pretended, to a friendly, trusting dog, that you had a 'tasty treat' enclosed in your hand, when you really had nothing whatsoever?</td></tr> <tr><td>-Have you ever deliberately given a foreigner (or anyone) totally wrong directions to a place they're desperate to get to, and not felt the slightest bit of guilt when they thanked you profusely?</td></tr> </table> </center> 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Count up your "Yes" answers and check the relevant line. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>Answers</b><br> 0: Crikey, what's your name - John Boy Walton?<br> 1: Gosh, you're a really nice person - or maybe a liar.<br> 2: Hmmm. That's probably about right. You're fairly 'normal'.<br> 3: You're just a little bit of a meanie!<br> 4: Got a vindictive streak, haven't you?<br> 5: Cruelty comes quite easily.<br> 6: Bit of a 'bar steward'!<br> 7: You ought to take up painting and decorating and move to Austria.<br> 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><B>TEST THREE - PSYCHE SHAPES</b><br> Take a very quick look at the shapes below. Decide which one is 'you'. If you really can't decide, then it might be worth taking a look at the notepad next to the computer, or telephone, or meeting room - there are sure to be doodles on it somewhere. Find one of your doodles and look for the predominant shape. That's the one to pick!

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>What You Picked</b><br> If you chose the <b>triangle</b> then you're in luck! This is the choice of most successful people (mind you, Gloria Hunniford's quite 'successful', so maybe it's not that brilliant). You know where it's at, where you've been and where you want to go. With your precision, perfectionism, quick mind and communicating skills you should go far. You're probably a tad on the boring side though. (Can't have everything, can we?) 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you chose the <b>circle</b> then you're a bit wet. All a bit emotional and wibbly round the edges. It's the shape the bloke from <i>Little House On The Prairie</i> and <i>Highway To Heaven</i> would probably have chosen. Basically you're a little bit of a sap. Quite 'nice' though. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you chose the <b>square</b> then you're one of the most yawnsome people on the entire planet. You analyse a problem and break it down into miniscule particles, examine them, and then break each of the miniscule particles down into even smaller sub-particles and examine them as well before making a decision - even for a problem as mundane as 'Shall I have another bowl of Sugar Puffs or not?' You're reliable though - dull and reliable! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you chose the <b>squiggly line</b> then you're always in a hurry. You get bored every eight pico-seconds and have to constantly find new challenges. You may be incredibly enthusiastic, but your 'ants in your pants' chopping and changing attitude to life means you'll probably turn out to be a jack of all trades, master of none. You're quite good fun at parties and you can put up quite a steady(ish) shelf (if called on to do so). Basically, you're one of life's 'slightly useful' people. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you chose the <b>star</b> then, boy, are you annoying. All sort of loud and excitable. A bit like a cross between Sue Pollard and Barry, the 'barrer boy' from <i>EastEnders</i>. Why don't you shut up for a few hours and give the rest of us a break, eh? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you chose the <b>tesseract</b> then you're really, really, really, (really) weird. Weird to the spookth degree, in fact. For those who don't know, a tesseract is a fourth dimensional 'hypercube'. Not the kind of shape us 'normal' folk dwell upon at all! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><B>TEST FOUR - IT'S IN THE PICTURE</b><br> Grab a bit of paper and a pen and quickly draw a scene containing <b>a house, a tree, the sun, a snake, some water</b> and <b>flowers</b>. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now analyze your drawing, referring to the points below. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The house</b> represents how you see yourself and the windows reveal how open you are. Count your windows. <!--4_house_windows=2--><!--4_house_windows=3--><!--4_house_windows=4-->The bigger and more numerous, the more honest and open you are.<!--/--><!--/--><!--/--> None at all? Blimey, you're a birrova 'secret squirrel'. If you've put a TV aerial on the roof, you're quite a receptive sort of cove. <!--4_house_smokingchimney=y-->If there's a chimney alongside it you might have pent up frustrations which you'll need to vent sooner or later. And if there's smoke coming out of your chimney, you're probably a little on the n-n-nervous side.<!--/--> 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The tree</b> represents your old mum <I>("Eh, not so much of the old." Squillions of mums throughout the land)</I>. Compare the size of the house (you) to the size of the tree (mummy). Does the tree positively tower over the house? Then, me ripe 'nana, you're a little bit dominated by her. That, or you just look up to her. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The sun</b> represents your father. How high is it above the house and the tree? The higher it is, the more dominant a role your father plays in the family. The position of the house and the tree in relation to the sun is meant to be quite important - if the sun and the tree are very close together then you feel your parents have quite a close relationship. If the house is between the sun and the tree then you may feel you're caught in the middle of a battle between them (or you're just second in the queue for the bathroom). 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The snake's</b> a goodie - it represents how you see your own sexuality. <!--4_snake_size=2-->If it is quite short it means you've got a tiddly... <I>(Enough of that. Ed)</I>. Erm, if the snake is quite short it means that you're not particularly interested in sex,<!--/--> while <!--4_snake_size=5-->a longer one shows more interest and less inhibition.<!--/--> If the snake is jolly looking then you're a bit of a flirty type - if it's scary then you find the prospect of sex a bit frightening. <!--4_snake_distance=4-->The further away from the house the snake is, the keener you are on sex.<!--/--> However - if it's right by the house (or in it) you might even be a virgin! (Get your rubber out, delete it, and move it away from the house quickly - before anyone sees). 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The water</b> is your emotional state. The more water there is, the more emotional you are. If you drew a moat surrounding the house then you're swamped by your passionate nature. <!--4_water_form=river--><!--4_water_form=sea-->A stream means you're hard on the surface but wibbly underneath.<!--/--><!--/--> <!--4_water_form=pool-->A pond means that you keep your emotions firmly in check.<!--/--> 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of <b>flowers</b> you've drawn is meant to indicate the amount of people you feel really close to. One particularly large flower means you have a 'best friend', 'chick', or (if you're a girl) a boyfriend.
