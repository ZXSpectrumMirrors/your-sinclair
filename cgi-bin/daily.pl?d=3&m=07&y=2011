We sent aged... errrrm ageless <I>Rachael J Smith</I> in search of living fossils. <I>(Try </I>Sinclair Abuser<I> and </I>Crush<I>. Ed)</I></b>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First they gave you 
<I><a href="greatescape.htm">The Great Escape</a></I> 
but now those 
dinosaur hunters at 
Denton Designs 
deliver an even greater escape. 
It's just like some Saturday 
afternoon movie where big 
lizards with stick-on rubber fins 
stand in for Stegosauri
(classically educated reviewer), 
and muscular hunks spout lines 
like, "It's as if time stood still 
(gasp)." Well, you'd be advised to 
look lively if you don't want to 
end up a dinosaur's dinner. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lost plateau is not the 
ideal place to crash-land your 
four-seater plane, but it was all 
Jarret could do to bring his 
passengers to safety on the 
edge of a cliff. Now he's 
responsible for taking them out 
of this prehistoric hell-hole and 
only one thing is certain - it's 
going to be no picnic (the
Thermos got broken in the 
crash). 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And who are they, these four 
individuals, thrown together by 
fate? Jarret himself is the he-man all-rounder. Athletic 
Cambridge scholar Dirk was 
recently married to Gloria, a 
tough cookie in a fragile frame. 
And then there's Clive, an 
overweight businessman and 
Gloria's father, who's about to 
learn that American Express will 
<I>not</I> do nicely for a crowd of 
angry natives. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each of these characters has 
their own uses, not the least of 
which is the ability to carry up to 
four objects, one of which is a 
bag which can hold a further 
four. Not that they're mere 
beasts of burden. Each one also 
has their own character, which 
you'll need to exploit to bring 
everyone home to safety. For 
example Dirk is a great help 
providing Gloria survives, but if 
she bites the dust he becomes a 
hopeless dork! 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For such a vast and complex 
adventure, play is remarkably 
simple, with just four direction 
controls, plus fire to make the 
character run (must be that 
jungle food)  though this is 
hardly advisable if you're leading 
the group as you're likely to 
leave the rest behind. There are 
a!so two menus <I>(Yum, yum. Phil)</I> 
- one to select characters and 
the other to control their inventory. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The graphics are everything 
you could ask and as 
imaginative as you'd expect from 
Denton, and the depth of the 
game is quite superb. My only 
grumble is that you can't save a 
game, which means you'll spend 
a lot of time repeating the early 
stages when you make a fatal 
mistake. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But all in all <I>Where Time Stood 
Still</I> looks destined to go down 
as a classic Spectrum game 
and it's almost certainly the best 
that's been produced solely for 
the 128. More of this sort of 
thing, and the machine will have 
a whole new lease of fife. So get 
into the realm of the dinosaurs 
and find out how time flies when 
it stands still! 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<center><font size=7><b>JARRET'S LOG</b></font></center>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><I>Ever since our plane crashed into this godforsaken jungle I
have been determined to keep a record of our adventures. 
Unluckily there is no recording studio available so I have 
had to settle for a diary... in the hope that one day 
somebody makes a computer game of the whole affair! 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 May: We spent the night camping by the plane - at least 
Clive did. Gloria says it's just his age. As dawn broke, I 
gathered my troops together. The first job was to collect the 
wreckage, including the bottle, for water. I spread it out 
amongst our party (we're party animals really), so that 
should somebody perish we wouldn't lose everything. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I got to thinking about the computer game You could 
just press space to bring down a window containing our 
portraits, select one with the cursor arrow, then select with 
space again. That might produce another window, with a 
portrait of the person in question - in this case, Gloria - 
and the four pockets. At the bottom would be any objects 
lying around the vicinity, which could be selected by 
moving onto their box, pressing fire, which would change 
the cursor into the object, then dragging it into the top of 
the window. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We walked left for a further box of supplies, before 
walking right to pick up a couple more objects, then 
heading upscreen, towards the mountains. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 May (later): After following the cliff face along to the left, 
and dodging the odd falling boulder (which reminded me of 
Gloria), we came to a low slung bridge (also like Gloria). A 
thought here on the computer game (maybe they could call 
it </I>Jarret Of The Jungle<I>) - a sound effects option would be 
 useful, so that you could hear when rocks were about to 
drop onto you. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I digress. We were crossing the bridge when 
suddenly the planks gave way below chubby Clive. Luckily 
I'd remembered to pick up the rope in the first screen (what 
- don't say you forgot), and dragged him out. Clive was 
grateful for the drag and is now poncing around the jungle 
like Danny La Rue on an off day. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 May: Night draws on - at least Clive wears his. For the 
rest of us this is a welcome chance to sleep. Well, for Gloria 
and her diminutive squirt of a boyfriend, Dirk, it is. Never 
could a man have been more accurately named - if only 
his surname was Head. What Gloria needs is a real man -
one with a macho name like... well, Jarret's pretty butch, 
don't you think? 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stay awake though. There are even more important 
matters in hand - though I've told Dirk it'll make him go 
blind! We headed to the right after the bridge, following the 
cliff edge, and watching out for more falling boulders, until 
we reached a safe place to get some shut-eye, safe in the 
shadow of this character selection menu. It allows us to 
turn off the infernal music which is keeping us awake, or 
to reset the game if we want to live through my finest 
moments again. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 May (later): I have been persuaded to make a detour into 
the mountains on a winding path. It proved fruitful 
because we found a knife. That can mean only one thing - 
the Swiss Army were here before us. At least if I need to get 
a boy scout out of a dinosaur's hoof I'll know what to do. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking of fruits, we were taking a well-earned rest 
when Clive started to grumble. If only he'd keep his voice 
down but speech bubbles that size can be seen half a mile 
away. A leader has to understand the psychology of his 
charges though. I listen to their requests for food, water 
and a tea-break - then look at the bar chart at the bottom 
to see if they're telling the truth. Trying to keep everybody 
happy, and stopping to let the slow-coaches catch up in 
case they wander off on their own is more like being a 
teacher with a school party. Next time I crash my plane in 
the jungle, I travel alone! 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 May (even later): We were heading away from the 
mountains when we found ourselves in brown sticky stuff. 
I know that Clive had been grumbling that he wanted to 
use the bog, but the massive swamp which blocked our 
path was not what he had in mind. Gloria said that if you 
walked onto it you'd be sucked under immediately. I began 
searching for a path. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eventually I found one, but discovered that if you stop 
walking for one moment, you begin to sink. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With wellies full of muddy waters (who insists on 
singing an r'n'b song about how sweaty my feet 
are!), I returned to land, and found that there are several 
paths across the swamp - only one of which will get you 
to the other side. A-maze-ing! I was also able to tell the 
others that there's a giant octopus lurking by the waters 
edge, which tries to grasp you with his tentacles. Clive let 
out a shrill screech and donned his cricketer's box. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, not wanting to appear egotistical, I think 
</I>Jungle Jarret Saves His Chums (Part 1)<I> sounds good. 
Just then a flippin' big budgie swooped in. 'A pterodactyl,' 
shouted Dirk. 'Terror - schmmeror,' I replied, 'I just hope 
it's not got loose bowels!' I was about to shout 'Shoo!' 
when... Help. The damned thing's got me in its beak. 
Doesn't it know that I'm the hero of this escapade...
ARRGGH! 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(From this point the diary continues in another, more 
feminine hand...) 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the discovery by our gallant leader that this is 
one of the areas plagued by predatory pterodactyls, 
swiftly followed by his sudden demise, I, Gloria, took 
charge of the remaining trio - immediately ordering Clive 
to complete this log in his elegant calligraphy. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now without the need to stop for photographs every five 
hundred yards, we made good progress. I soon found a 
path across the swamp, about half way up, which wound 
round, but eventually delivered us to dry land. That led 
straight into a native village, but luckily Dirk has a little 
knack - for translation that is. I always suspected he was 
bilingual.

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon Clive was gossiping away with the natives about 
dress hints, how to sew sequins onto a loincloth, and how 
dropping the odd bauble may make them more friendly. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now it's a question of going down to the river, where we 
can refill the water bottle, then finding a way across. There 
appears to be a path behind the waterfall, but I'm not sure 
about a Bridge </I>Under<I> Troubled Waters. After that I've 
heard tell of a stone circle and another native village, as 
well as a temple and many other thrills. But the most 
exciting prospect is... appearing on Wogan when I lead 
these dead-legs to safety. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about Jarret though, you ask. A tear forms in my 
eye. He shall have his memorial - the computer game. 
Only it's going to be called The Heroic Adventures Of The 
Great And Good Gloria. So there!
