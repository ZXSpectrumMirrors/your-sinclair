		You don't appear to support frames. I'll put in some more helpful text about WOS searches "soon". In the meantime, you can continue your WOS search <a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseek.cgi?regexp=the%20astonishing%20adventures%20of%20mr%20weems%20and%20the%20she%20vampires">here</a>.<p>
		You should be redirected very soon, though...<p>
