<TR><TD>I have recently purchased <I>Lords of Midnight</I> and must
say that this is a game no Spectrum owner should be without.
It is brilliant!<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have (to date) completed the quest three times
and the military victory once, I would be more than happy to
offer help to anyone still struggling. (I must be honest,
however, and admit that when my armies conquered
Ushgarak, Doomdark had already taken Xajorkith and
Morkin was safely tucked away in the Citadel of Gloom
with the Ice Crown!). Fans of the game may be interested to
know that I had so many armies that I couldn't put them all
into battle. I took the Citadel in one night losing less than 10
men, <I>and</I> there were about 12,000 Foul either on the
Citadel&nbsp;or immediately adjacent to it. (It certainly helps to
seize the Ice Crown before attempting to capture Ushgarak!)<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, a special message for Phil McDonald (article on
p.8 September). Phil - your statement that Morkin cannot
be safely accompanied by an army on his quest to locate
the Ice Crown is rather misleading. You will probably
have discovered that Morkin can only recruit certain
characters - ie. <B>those which will be of benefit to him on his
journey</B>. The Lord of Shadows, who is within one
day's travelling of the Tower of the Moon, can be recruited
by Morkin, and can be very useful to him by going ahead
and "clearing the way" of dragons, wolves, skulkrin and
the like. Certainly, this particular Lord is of no use on the
battlefield - safely ensconced in a keep he can usually
manage to kill a few hundred of Doomdark's men and lose
perhaps half his own army of 1,000 warriors, but out on the
plains he is absolutely hopeless and usually loses the lot,
himself included! Even Farflame the Dragonlord can
do better - when utterly invigorated he can kill 400 in
one go! It is not impossible to complete the adventure
without recruiting Shadows (I have done it) but it is much
easier with him around, at least until Morkin reaches Farflame.
 <i>(Julie E Lewis in Micro Adventurer issue 12)</i> 

<br><hr>
<I>LORDS OF MIDNIGHT</I> is a brilliant game - by far the
best I own and an absolute must for any Spectrum owner.
My only complaint is that it is too easy! On my first major
attempt, my brother and I won a military victory, taking eight
hours to do it. The next day we won a quest victory.<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we were new to the game, we did without certain lords we
had not found, like Farflame, Korinel, Rorath, Blood, Thimrath,
Herath and Lorgrim the Wise. Also Shadows, Brith,
Lothoril and Gloom did not reach the battle in time. We
also managed to win without losing Xajorkith or capturing
the Ice Crown.<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We left the Lord of Xajorkith there, and moved
Shimeril to help him. The armies defending the Citadel
were either left as they were or recruited by the two Lords. We
managed to take Ushgarak before these armies were defeated.<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our offensive tactics were simple. We concentrated our
men at the Citadel of Ithril, marched on and took the
Citadel of Grarg, got the men invigorated, and took Ushgarak.<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now to your article in November. I was particularly
impressed by Geoff Lynas' victory. This is obviously a much
better tactic than mine, and also gives a much greater
chance of victory.<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Julie Lewis' account was excellent. There were only one or
two little mistakes I could pick out, and these were in the list
of the Lords. Of the Lords of the Fey, Whispers has a keep,
not a citadel, while Dregrim has a citadel not a keep.&nbsp;Also
the Lord of Thrall and Korinel the Fey are found at villages,
not keeps, but this is mentioned in the text anyway.

<FONT COLOR=red><B>War of the Solstice</B></FONT>
<BR><BR>
<I><B>Phil McDonald</B> goes in search of the Ice Crown - the object
at the heart of the</I> Lords of Midnight.
<BR><BR>
LORDS OF MIDNIGHT is described as an epic
rather than an adventure, something completely new. After extensive testing - I
have immersed myself till midnight and
beyond - I think epic is a fair description.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Lords of Midnight</I> is well packaged and
includes an excellent instruction book
printed on best quality glossy paper. Here
you will find the story of the mysterious
Land of Midnight, and the war of the
Solstice.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also included is a keyboard overlay to fit
the Spectrum keyboard. Unfortunately, I
am one of the many people who have fitted
a full stroke keyboard, and the overlay
doesn't fit. Still, it is an excellent feature
and makes the package that bit more professional. Inputs for the game are all by
single key, but there are so many options
that this&nbsp;does not detract from it.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the start of the game, you control the
four main characters. The central character
is Luxor the Moonprince - he must rally
the forces of the free to defeat the evil
Doomdark (Spectrum). Luxor wears the
Moonring, which enables him to see
through the eyes of his allies.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Morkin is Luxor's son, half man and half
Fey. Corleth the Fey may be able to raise an
army from the Forests of Midnight, while
Rorthron the Wise may be able to seek help
from the wise who live like hermits in their
tall towers. If more than one person wants
to take part, it is possible for each to play
one or more characters, which is ideal for a
family.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two methods you can pursue to
defeat&nbsp;Doomdark. The first is to gather as
many allies as possible to your banner and
attempt to defeat the evil hordes on the
bloody field of battle.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You could also send Morkin north to
find the Tower of Doom and capture the
dreaded Ice Crown. However, Morkin cannot be accompanied safely by an army and,
having found the Ice Crown, must discover
how to destroy it. The wise may be able to
offer advice in this matter, but it's still up
to you to fulfill the conditions.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of&nbsp;the two victory conditions, defeating
Doomdark's armies can be a protracted affair, likely to take several sittings (I still
haven't done it). Fortunately, there is a
save game option. It is possible to try either
quest, or both simultaneously.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no animated graphics
in <I>Lords of Midnight</I> and yet graphics
are the strongest point in an altogether excellent program. By a
method described as landscaping, the scenery is put
together in blue and
white. The perspective
is superb.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no set
'pictures' in memory,
each feature in view
is constructed starting from objects
farthest away and
working towards
you. However, it
is all done in a
split second, before the view appears on
screen. Therefore, you cannot see things
which are hidden from view and some
features may be partially obscured, say by
trees.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the features you will come
across are citadels, keeps, towers, mountains, forests and lakes, all beautifully
drawn. The best view of all is of advancing
armies, banners flying. Any ally, denizen or
enemy in the adjacent area in the direction
in which you are looking, is drawn in the
foreground in multicolour. There are
32,000 possible views, eight from each location. You can look and move N, NE, E etc.
It is possible to hide in forests and
mountains.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing to do is to attempt to
enlist some allies quickly. Having done
that, you can use them to enlist further
allies, thus freeing your main characters for
more urgent matters. Enlisting an ally such
as Lord Blood or Lord Shimmerill,
automatically brings their armies to your
aid. Visiting a ruin, a henge, a lith or a
cave, you may find a magic sword such&nbsp;as
Dragonslayer or Wolfslayer. On the other
hand, you might find something altogether
nasty.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to frighten yourself, you
could approach the pass to the north of the
Plains of Blood to see Doomdark's hordes
flooding through each night. Doomdark's
warriors and riders have different shield
emblems for each army. In addition to
these, other nasties that you will encounter
include dragons, wolves and skulkrin.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Atmosphere, that elusive ingredient sadly
lacking in so many other adventures and
games, fairly oozes from <I>Lords of Midnight</I>. You can spend hours just exploring
the landscape. The book includes a map of
the Lands of Midnight, which shows major
features such as plains, mountain ranges
and forests. However, if you are looking
for the Keep of Lord Blood, you
must search the Plains of Blood
until you find the one he is at,
for there are several.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not yet succeeded in
finding all the possible additional allies and armies. You
aren't told how many, or where they are,
but I would guess at about 20. They take
quite a bit of controlling once you've found
a dozen or more! There are several extra
nice touches such as Gothic writing and,
best of all, whichever character or ally you
are controlling, their own heraldic shield
appears on screen.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each character has up to eight moves a
day, depending on the terrain through
which they are passing. Travelling in mountains can be particularly  exhausting.
Characters and armies can be invigorated
to a greater or lesser degree, depending on
what fighting or travelling they have done.
Exhaustion can be alleviated by resting at
villages, citadels or keeps, or negated by
drinking at magic lakes.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even when a citadel or keep contains no
new ally, you can recruit a few warriors or
riders from the garrison. If an army is facing insurmountable odds, it is easier to
defend a keep, or better still, a citadel, than
fight in the open. Your characters' horses
may be slain in battle, and your warriors
become exhausted quicker than riders.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doomdark bends the Ice Fear towards
his enemies and if the Ice Fear is strong, his
armies are harder to defeat.&nbsp;The Ice Fear
can be diminished if Morkin captures the
Ice Crown or by defeating Doomdark's armies. Your allies will be afraid to a greater
or lesser degree depending on the strength
of the Ice Fear. If
they become too
afraid, some of them
may refuse to obey
or even desert. Several
armies can take part
in any one
battle or siege. When all of your characters
and allies have used their move allowances
for the day, you press the 'night' key. At
this stage Doomdark moves his armies and
the outcome of any battles, sieges and skirmishes are decided.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Factors affecting battles include the
strengths of opposing armies, the strength
of the Ice Fear, the quality of your commanders and the involvement, or not, of
Luxor. If Luxor is killed, you lose control
of the Moonring and therefore all of your
allies, unless Morkin can find the Moonring. If Morkin wears the Moonring, he can
no longer continue his quest to destroy the
Ice Crown.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up, Lords of Midnight is well
designed, well programmed, with excellent
packaging, and is reasonably priced. This
program deserves to be a financial success,
to encourage other software houses to be
more <I>Adventurous</I>. The author of Midnight,&nbsp;Mike Singleton, tells me there are
two sequels in the pipeline. Personally, I
can't wait!
<BR>
 <i>(Phil McDonald, Mike Singleton in Micro Adventurer issue 10)</i> 

<br><hr>
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Lords of Midnight</I> author Mike Singleton revealed to MAD:<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are roughly 4,000 locations on the map of Midnight.<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Possible allies include the Wise, Lords of the Free and
of the Fey - and at least two rather unusual characters.<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty or more characters can be recruited to aid Luxor.<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lords will not always be in the same place; Doomdark's
armies can force them to move before you can reach them.<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Icemark, a land to the north-east of Midnight, will be the
setting for the first sequel, <I>Doomdark's Revenge</I>. The third in the
series will take place to the south of Midnight, and is to be called
<I>The Eye of the Moon</I>.<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Commodore 64 version is planned, as is a French&nbsp;version
for the Thomson micro.<br>

<FONT COLOR=red><B>The Lords of Midnight</B></FONT>
<BR><BR>
<I><B>Julie Lewis</B> leads the armies of the Free to victory in the
struggle against the
hordes of the evil Doomdark.</I>
<BR><BR>
THERE is little doubt in my mind and, I
suspect, in those of most of you reading
this article, that <I>The Lords of Midnight</I> is
one of the most exciting games currently
available for the Spectrum.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having completed (to date) four quests
and one military defeat, I am writing this
article in the hope of helping those of you
who are still struggling desperately against
Doomdark and his hordes.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are 32 main characters in the game
and these will be listed at the end of the article. Suggestions as to where they may be
found will be given as we go along.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have had more experience of success
with the quest, it is this aspect of the game
which I shall deal with first. You will no
doubt be aware that this is the quickest way
to defeat Doomdark - it is also the easiest.
However, it is possibly not the most satisfying!
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On reading the booklet included with the
cassette, you will have been told (p.21,
para.3) that &quot;Morkin can have no army to
help him on his journey&nbsp;...&quot;; this,
however, is not strictly true. Admittedly,
Morkin cannot recruit any men to assist
him, but he can be <I>accompanied</I> by an army - there is a subtle difference here, and
I suspect Beyond of being not unintentionally misleading when writing those words!
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Morkin starts out on his journey,
he should travel N- W- NW- NE. This will
bring him, in exactly one day, to the Lord
of Shadows, who can be recruited to his
aid. Do not, however, move Shadows at
this point (in any case, he is always 'slightly
tired' when you reach him, but don't ask
me what he's been up to in that forest!)
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may think that it would be more sensible to take a more direct route to
Shadows, which would be a combination of
three moves North and one West, but this
would involve Morkin in the risk of being
killed by wolves or skulkrin (he is not
particularly  good  at  overcoming the
latter, especially,
unless armed).
The directions I
have given are,
therefore, the
safest. You
will find
that it is
sometimes
preferable
to take
slightly longer
routes
occasionally  when  directing  a  single
character, unless they have with them a
sword such as Dragonslayer or Wolfslayer (incidentally,&nbseach sword will kill all
three kinds of creatures, not just the one it
is named after). A single character should
always take an available sword rather than
the leader of an army - if 2,400 warriors
and riders can't kill a few wolves, they
aren't going to be much use when the real
fun starts!
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because you have recruited the Lord of
Shadows, Morkin's journey will be less
hazardous insofar as wolves, dragons and
skulkrin are concerned.  Shadows and
his  1,000 warriors can&nbsp;go ahead of
Morkin and  kill  them   all.  However,
Shadows is not at all as successful when it
comes to fighting Doomdark's minions -
when situated at a keep he can usually hold
his own for one night, but without such
protection, or the support of other armies,
he can easily lose all his men in one go
(sometimes himself as well, which would be
a pity, because he's probably most anxious
to return to whatever - or whoever - is
waiting for him in that forest!)
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, to&nbsp;continue ... On the second
day, you should direct Morkin and his
protecting band North-easterly to the Keep
of Dodrak. Here, if you're lucky, they will
be able to spend a night without encountering Doomdark. Shadows and his men
should refresh themselves here (Morkin will
not need this facility yet). Remember that
whatever benefits (or otherwise!) are offered by ruins, liths, and so on, can only be
taken advantage of once - do not put 'utterly invigorated' troops into a lake when
you also command an army which is tiring.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the third day, three moves North will
take the travellers into the Mountains of
Dodrak, and from here, on the fourth
day, you will, on moving slightly North
again towards the Plains of&nbsp;Ogrim, see
two groups of mountains ahead of you.
Position yourself so you can see a Tower
in each of these directions, and aim for the
one on the right. This will lead you to the
Ruin  of Coroth,  where  Morkin  can
recruit Farflame the Dragonlord. At this
point, it doesn't matter too much if
Shadows loses his army (which he may
well do, as Doomdark arrives here at
about the same time) because Farflame is
an excellent fighter and can easily kill up to
450 men in one go, which is more than
Shadows and his warriors can manage! As
a matter of fact, it can be an actual
advantage later on if Shadows does find
himself without an army ...
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, when leaving Coroth, you find yourself being pursued by Doomdark's men,
proceed North to the Forest of Lothoril,
where Morkin will be able to seek the assistance of the Lord of Lothoril. Do not stay
here too long, however, as the enemy will
arrive within a day or two. If you are concentrating on a military defeat, you should
leave Lothoril at his keep so you can remain
aware of what is going on there - Doomdark is unlikely to return once Morkin has
left.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once past the Keep of Lothoril, you are
<I>almost</I> home and dry ...
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On your&nbsp;way to the Tower of Doom (no,
I am not going to give you directions!) let
anyone without a sword collect Dragonslayer at the Cavern of Death, and whoever
is most in need of refreshment acquire this
at the Cavern of Despair. You needn't take
the Lord of Shadows on this last lap. He
will only attract attention if he still has his
army, and if he hasn't he is of no use
anyway.  Once you reach the Tower,
Morkin should SEEK. Then, as long as the
right person is with him, just press the
Night button, and - voila!
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Farflame is dead when you reach Coroth (check he hasn't been forced to move
slightly by Doomdark) you can either go
towards the Frozen Wastes and recruit
Fawkrin  the  Skulkrin  at  Moonhenge
(whatever you do, do not SEEK here -
you've been warned!) or go straight to the
Tower of Doom and steal the Ice Crown.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you choose the latter course, you then
have two choices. You can either go
towards the NE end of the Frozen Wastes
and recruit Lorgrim the Wise or send
Morkin to Lake Mirrow (S from the Keep
of Lothoril). The second alternative is probably the easiest, as the Tower of Lorgrim
is difficult to locate, and Doomdark has
lookout armies posted at various strategic
points along the Wastes.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you wish to take the Ice Crown but not
destroy it, in order to concentrate on the
military defeat, place Morkin in the Citadel
of Gloom (NW corner of Frozen Wastes).
Doomdark rarely attacks here more than
once, and if you HIDE a single character in
the snowhall on the Plains of the Lost
(this is where an armyless Shadows can
come in handy) you can easily see when an
army is approaching and temporarily
move Morkin out of the Citadel into the
Mountains of Gloom (just move North a
couple of times). Of course, you then run
the risk  of Doomdark's  men  going
straight to Morkin and attacking him, so
if he is fairly energetic it may be safer to
stay in the Citadel and let the Lord of
Gloom  (who  should,  of course,  be
recruited) protect him - Morkin can
survive several battles as long as he is not
exhausted.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not worry about the fact that the
Lord of Gloom is 'utterly afraid' when in
his Citadel. For some&nbsp;reason, as soon as he
takes one step out of it he brightens up considerably, and he will fight. Once more, it
seems as if Beyond are pulling a fast one -
but I didn't waste my time sending commanders all the way to the Citadel of
Gloom to take over Gloom's men!
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, it is worth mentioning that you
should always  keep  Morkin  and  his
'guards' together - Farflame, for instance,
can travel as far in one hour as Morkin can
in a day over flat ground, but don't fall into
the deliberate trap set by Beyond by letting
him go on ahead. If by any chance Morkin
and Farflame (for instance) are separated,
send the latter to the Tower of Doom, or
some location on the way which you can
find easily, and HIDE them there until
Morkin catches up.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now for the military defeat!
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Mike Singleton, the creator
of <I>Midnight</I>, it is more or less impossible to
take Ushgarak before Xajorkith falls, so
you may as well take all available&nbsp;men off
the citadels and keeps (including Xajorkith)
in order to build up your armies, rather
than leaving them for Doomdark to wantonly destroy (in fact, Mike himself also
recommends this strategy).
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Send Luxor SE twice and then S to&nbsp;the
Citadel of Gard. SEEKing at the Lith of
Gard will earn him an extra day's travelling, and doing the same at the Lith of the
Moon or Mitharg will arm him with the
very useful sword Wolfslayer. Another of
these useful weapons is available at the
Citadel of Gard.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuing on his way, Luxor should
travel E to Brith, SE to Rorath, E to
Thimrath  and  Xajorkith,  and  North
through Dregrim to Ithrorn, via Utarg and
Kumar. It is a good idea to keep him
without armies at&nbsp;this stage, as he will move
quicker and be safer, and you can easily
provide him with the full quota of 1,200
riders and the same number of warriors by
allowing 'utterly afraid' and 'very afraid'
characters to drop men on keeps and
citadels in the North and letting Luxor (and
other brave commanders) collect them
when they arrive.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corleth the Fey should go straight to the
Forest of Kor and then to Dreams, via the
Keep of Blood (four N and straight E, in
any combination to avoid danger). He
also may be better off without an army, as
the journey from Kor to Dreams is a
hazardous one. Waste no time in arriving
at the Village of Kor, as Doomdark
arrives there early.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rorthron the Wise should aim for the
Citadel of Shimeril (South easterly) and
thence to the Village of Thrall, the Keep of
Herath (Doomdark arrives here early, too),
the Citadels of Marakith and Kumar, and
the Keep of Utarg. Very few characters can
recruit the Utarg - Rothron is one, the
Lord of Dregrim is another, and Luxor
sometimes can, usually if he assists him in
battle. Note, however, that the reverse
doesn't always apply - Utarg doesn't seem
able to recruit Dregrim, for instance.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other commanders can&nbsp;recruit the
remaining Lords - Rorath or Brith can
collect  Morning,  Shimeril  can  recruit
Mitharg and Morning can recruit Dawn
and Athoril. Keep smaller armies together
rather than splitting them up.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note that the size of an army doesn't
necessarily indicate how well it will do in
battle. Thimrath the Fey, for instance, has
a relatively small army, yet he can quite
easily take three keeps in succession and
lose very few men. Generally speaking, the
armies of the Fey seem to be worth the
equivalent of an army double the size commanded by a Lord of the Free.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rothron and Corleth can take part in
battles when they are invigorated if their
assistance is needed. Rorthron, for example, can put paid to around 125 Foul in one
go when 'utterly invigorated' - indeed, I
found on one occasion that using this
rather worn-looking old man to assist a
Lord in trouble actually meant the difference between victory and defeat!
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Send all your armies in a Northerly direction to the Citadel of Ithrorn via the Forest
of Whispers. Stay at Ithrorn until all your
armies are together and fully recuperated
from their journeys. Attack from Doomdark at this stage of the game is unlikely.
There are a fair number of keeps and
villages around Ithrorn where you can
speed up your armies' recoveries, and
several lakes along the top of the Frozen
Wastes, which you can use as you
approach Ushgarak from the rear, gathering overnight in the Forest of Doom.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You should now take the two keeps near
the Citadel of Ushgarak - place half your
armies in each keep, balancing them equally for size. Put the not- so- brave
commanders and their men in the same keep as
Luxor, and let them fight alongside him -
they'll perform better. Your men can remain in these keeps until they are all
'utterly invigorated' if you wish, Doomdark will
not risk attacking such numbers. From one
keep, take half your armies and move West
once to the Citadel. From the other keep,
take half again and move N- N- NW. Attack
Ushgarak and, if necessary, return to the
keeps and continue with fresh armies. Use
the lakes and villages around the Citadel
when refreshment is needed. The Citadel
nearest to the furthest keep can be attacked
and taken if you wish. Then move straight
back into the keep, let Doomdark reclaim
the Citadel, and attack and take it again -
I slaughtered about 10,000 Foul nasties that
way (needless to say, Doomdark didn't risk
another attempt!) Don't waste energy doing this, however, if you are seriously
attempting to take Ushgarak before Doomdark takes Xajorkith (if you manage it, let
Mike Singleton know how you did it!)
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, you should avoid marching on
Ushgarak until Morkin has possession of
the Ice Crown - unless, of course, you're
trying to prove something!
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will probably find, as I did, that one
night's fighting is all it takes if you have
already stolen the Ice Crown and Xajorkith
has long fallen into enemy hands. (It's the
shock, you see, they thought they'd disposed of your lot and were busy celebrating
... !). Actually, I was rather disappointed
to find it so easy - I only lost five men
(honestly!) and I had so many armies I
couldn't even put them all into battle! So
much for the ding-dong affair I'd been
building up to in the three months since the
Solstice had begun (yes, it did take me that
long, but the shock to Doomdark was probably greater because of it!). Obviously,
the longer it takes you to reach Ushgarak,
the more of Doomdark's men you will have
to overcome, as more and more armies
keep arriving from Xajorkith; but I disposed of about 20,000 in that one night, so I
wouldn't worry too much if you're at it for
a year!
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incidentally, never try to put too many
armies into any one battle. It is better to
lose a few of your men and kill the majority
of Doomdark's army rather than scaring
them off - your army will tire but won't
kill anyone!
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doomdark has three kinds of armies -
attackers, defenders and what Mike Singleton calls 'hunters'. The first two varieties
are self-explanatory; the third are programmed to follow certain characters, such as
Luxor and Morkin. If these armies are involved in battle they will immediately
withdraw if they see the character they are
programmed to hunt, and start after them.
This is why it is essential to use the HIDE
facility whenever danger is anticipated.
(Yes, I know things would be a whole lot
simpler if Morkin could HIDE, but would
you really like it that easy!)
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key to success in this marvellous
game, especially where the quest is concerned, is to make full use of the SAVE
facility. You should SAVE prior to entering
into any battles which have a doubtful outcome, and <I>always</I> before moving Morkin,
at least from day three onwards. Then, if
you lose your battle, or Morkin encounters
danger or is killed, you can re-load your
saved game as often as is necessary to
achieve success in battle or safety for
Morkin before allowing Night to fall. It is
worth adding here that the first time you
enter into a battle you will kill more men
than on immediately subsequent attempts
(after a while, however, the total will creep
up again) so be prepared for the fact that if
you have to re-stage a battle because
Morkin was killed, you will not do so well
when using your saved game, unless you
continue re-loading until an acceptable
level is reached.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>The Lords of Midnight</I> has only one or
two 'faults'. The most inconvenient is something which seems like a bug in the program
but, according to Mr Singleton, probably
isn't (I don't think he's telling!). Basically,
what happens is that if you prefer to play a
defensive game and try to place more than
1,200 men in a citadel, you will find that
most of them disappear inside, never to
return (well, I suppose there have to be
some women somewhere in this Land!). As
an example, Xajorkith will have 750 riders
in it when you arrive. You can place 400
more into it, but if you exceed this number
you will lose 1,000 and not get them back.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My only other 'complaint' concerns the
rather feeble victory announcements.
Bleeps and flashing lights would have been
out of place, I admit, but what does finally
appear is something of an anti-climax after
all the blood, sweat and tears!
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As things are supposed to come in threes,
I'll also have a little moan about the fact
that the keyboard overlay seems to have a
will entirely of its own.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enjoy yourselves in the Land of Midnight, but don't look for me there. As soon
as I'm utterly invigorated I'll be joining
Tarithel the Fey on her journey <I>beyond</I> the
Frozen Wastes to rescue Morkin.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hold on there, son, I'll soon have you
out of there, Doomdark's daughter doesn't
frighten <I>me</I>. (Why does that boy always expect me to get him out of trouble?)

<BR>
<I>Geoff Lyas successfully
defeated Doomdark by defending Xajorkith - here's how.</I>
<BR>
THE COUNCIL of the Wise is
dissolved. The War has begun.
<BR>
	Rorthron  travels East,  hurriedly
rallying Lords to the Cause, his ultimate
goal to guide the Lords Ithrorn and
Marakith to the safety of Lorgrim's
Tower, there to remain until the final
assault on Ushgarak.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Morkin, accompanied by Corleth, is
despatched&nbsp;North-West to seek refuge in
the Citadel of Gloom. From this
vantage point he effectively neutralises
the Ice Fear throughout the entire
campaign.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luxor speeds southwards to recruit
Lord Gard and thence to the Icy Wastes.
Five days of Eastward travel brings him
safely to Xajorkith followed closely by
Lord Rorath and Thimrath the Fey.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As each Lord is mobilised he in turn
calls up his neighbour and all follow
their predetermined routes unswervingly
towards the assembly at Xajorkith. By
the eighth day Morkin completes his
hazardous journey. The end of the
second week marks the gathering of
sixteen footsore armies in the Citadel of
Xajorkith and on the Plains of Corelay.
The vigil begins ...
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three days pass before the first of
Doomdark's many armies arrives, hurls
itself at the Citadel walls and is
completely destroyed. For forty days
the assaults continue with the same
results on each occasion until on the
sixtieth day of the war the Forces of
Darkness are spent.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luxor selects his four strongest
Marshals and together they march
irresistibly Northwards ...
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Conclusions</B>
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The campaign ended with the fall of
Ushgarak on the eighty-sixth day with
no loss of Lordly life. The following
observations may hold the key ...
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doomdark has two weapons, the Ice
Fear and his many armies.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Morkin attracts the Ice Fear.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Morkin is safe in the Northwest;
Xajorkith is in the Southeast.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doomdark has a finite number of
men, and must garrison captured Keeps
and Citadels of which there are many
between Ushgarak and Xajorkith.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once an army is in garrison it may no
longer move.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A significantly outnumbered offensive or defensive army is annihilated
with no loss to the opposition.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doomdark's forces attack as soon as
they have a target. They do not wait to
gather strength.
