<br><hr>

	<I>Pirate Adventure</I> starts you off in your
London flat with a bottle of rum and a sack
of crackers - just the items for a quiet
evening at home - but of course that's not
quite the idea and staying sober is essential
for what Mr Adams has in store. Upstairs
you find a book that suggests your task, to
recover Long John Silver's two treasures
from Treasure Island, and reveals the way
to more items to help with the mission.
<BR>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting into the mood and yoho-ing
everywhere you suddenly find yourself
whisked to a tropical beach - but the place
is called Pirate Island. Still I'm sure you
knew it wouldn't be that simple! Some
parts of a boat are evident and it seems likely that if you want to get to Treasure&nbsp;Island
you'd best get busy.
<BR>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will soon find yourself in a grass
hut, faced by a mean and thirsty pirate.
There is a talkative parrot of course, who
quickly depletes your food supply but his
quips seem useful and fair exchange etc.
More of a problem is a locked chest so you
set off in search of some keys.
<BR>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a maze of caves you find some hungry
crocodiles and a locked door - no help
there. You might make your next step to
cracking the adventure at the top of the
Island where, lightly armed, you discover
several useful items but a couple of them
won't go where you want them - another
locked door? - the keys are essential now!
Here you get your first view of Treasure
Island. It looks too far to swim but you can
try if you like.
<BR>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clawing your way back to the flat you
discover that the keys were there all the
time. Thank goodness you found them -
the Master Adventurer would have had you
on the carpet if you hadn't. Perhaps you
should search the rest of the flat to see what
else you've overlooked, before returning to
the island.
<BR>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon you'll have your map and plans and
this should help bolster you up to tackle
those crocs. Be brave, don't lose your bottle. At last! Your ship is built and its time to
collect your well- rested crew and cast off
for Treasure Island. Don't forget your pets
and anything else you think could be
useful.
<BR>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a brief but restful cruise you step
ashore. If you've kept pace this far, the rest
should be pretty simple but you could bear
in mind that Pirate's parrots can be pretty
pugilistic. Finally don't be impatient to
open your present - can't you wait till you
get home?
<BR>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Pirate Adventure</I> is the easiest of Scott's
classics and I thoroughly recommend it to
anyone as a first step in adventure. Scott
himself, though, was a little dissatisfied
with it and the forthcoming Adventure 14 is
a follow-up to it.
