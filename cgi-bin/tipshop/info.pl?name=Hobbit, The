<TR><TD>Go east when all else fails or north when past the mystic Elves.<br>
A stone troll is the key to the door when day dawns.<br>
Beware of pitfalls in Beorn's house.<br>
Turn west at the wooded gate to the north.<br>
When pale eyes are about to sting, retrace your steps.

Dr Paul Holmes of Middlesbrough sent a map of part of the game. He has not had much luck with Gollum and the ring and asks what is the answer to the first riddle. It has always been my policy to kill dumb animals in adventures and this is no exception. It is better to kill Gollum as soon as you see him. If you do not he may slip through your fingers or you could be choked by his.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holmes also wants to know what is the goblin's cache and where it can be found. To find it you will have to be captured and put into the goblins' dungeon. You will find some sand on the floor.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you DIG you will find a trapdoor. Hobbits are not strong animals, so ask Thorin several times to SMASH or BREAK the trapdoor. When it is broken you will find the cache in a hole beneath it. I am not giving away all the secrets, however, and you will have to decide what to do with it.
 <i>(Colin Appleyard, Quentin Heath in Sinclair User issue 14)</i> 

<br><hr>
In the March issue I stated that several people were having difficulties when they got through the barrels and tried to go through the trap door in the Elven King's cellar. That happened to me and I have now found that unless you have the ring on your finger the program may crash. That means you will have to go through the goblins' tunnels before attempting to get into the barrels and rolling through the trapdoor.
 <i>(Colin Appleyard, Quentin Heath in Sinclair User issue 14)</i>

With the help of reader Colin Appleyard I have found the golden key in the Misty Mountains. His instructions are to go north from the Misty Mountains, then north-east, north, south-east, down three times until you are in the misty valley, then east, take the key, up, west, north and you are back on the mountain again.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>Hints and tips</b><br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kill Gollum if the ring you find,<br>
His riddles will only fog your mind.<br>
A rope is as good as a boat.<br>
If with your sword at the web you hack,<br>
You'll find yourself defenceless against attack.<br>
If when you finish you retreat to the east,<br>
Just be prepared or you'll be deceased.

The questions in my postbag centred mainly on the Goblins' Dungeon.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way out of the dungeon is simple. Ask Thorin to open the window. Then ask him to pick you up and carry you through the window. You will then find yourself in one of the many corridors of the Goblins' domain.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people have not tried to cross the river and doubled back to the forest gate. There is a boat hidden on the other side of the river and all you have to do is to throw the rope across, pull the&nbsp;boat through the water and climb into it.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will then find yourself on the east bank and about to face those deadly spiders looking for a quick snack.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you arrive at the first spiders' web you must break it with your hand. If you try to pierce it with your sword you will find yourself in trouble. Once you have broken the web you will be in the domain of the spiders. You can go east or north from there but if you want to survive you should take the latter option. If you go east you will finish in the deep bog.
 <i>(Quentin Heath in Sinclair User issue 17)</i> 

<br><hr>
The Elven King's Cellar is also a cause of difficulties. Some people find it difficult to get into the barrels to float in the river beneath the trap-door. It is best to have the ring in this situation. Wear it when the butler enters and eventually he will empty one of the barrels and leave off the lid. Get into the barrel and wait for the butler to push it into the river. You are then on your way to Lake Town and a battle with the dragon, Smaug.
 <i>(Quentin Heath in Sinclair User issue 17)</i> 

<br><hr>
To negotiate the forest path safely in The Hobbit it is essential to wait twice at each location and, of course, the only way to defeat the trolls is to wait for dawn in a safe place.
 <i>(Richard Price in Sinclair User issue 35)</i> 

<br><hr>
One Olaf the Storyteller from Clophill talked of his travels with The Hobbit in Middle Earth. He has found a way to engender dissension amongst friend and foe alike. While wearing the Ring of Power, thus invisible, he found himself in the company of Elrond, Gandalf, Thorin, Gollum and a disgusting goblin. When Olaf struck Gandalf, half in fun, I suppose, Gandalf assumed Thorin had done this deed and hit him back. A sharp slap administered to Thorin set the whole company ablaze and a giant brawl resulted. You may try this yourself to enliven the long journey to the dragon's lair.
 <i>(Olaf The Storyteller, Gordo Greatbelly in Sinclair User issue 37)</i> 

<br><hr>
Others, as is so common, related their woes and problems in this land. Martin the Campbell, a valiant Scot from Lesmahagow, could not slay the dragon Smaug. Listen, I said to him, first find Bard the archer and carry him with you. When the&nbsp;set-to begins Bard will shoot Smaug if instructed. At this, Nick 'The Knuckle' Rogers, a little maudlin with the wine, confessed his utter inability to escape the Elven King's cellar. He had gone so far as to slay the poor butler in his rage! If I understood him correctly I tell him now not to enter a barrel. Let the butler throw one in the stream and then jump upon it. That may be best for all - especially the butler.

<!-- Column 1 -->
Probably the most popular adventure
ever created for any home computer is
Melbourne House's <I>The Hobbit</I>. It's fitting therefore that our first foray will be
into this computerised version of Tolkien's classic book. <BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Most of you will have read (or have
found out by other devious means) the
art of escaping the Goblin's Dungeon on
the shoulders of Thorin. (By the way,
Thorin's usefulness is over once he has
performed this task - but stick with him
in case you get thrown back in the dungeon.) The quickest way to the dragon's
domain - and hence the treasure - is via
the Elfking's Dungeon, so tarry by the
Forest Gate until an elf comes along and
throws you in the Red Dungeon. From
there, wait until the Red Door is
unlocked, go West and hang around until
the butler throws the barrel through the
trap door; when that occurs, jump on to
the barrel and you'll be taken down the
river towards Long Lake and the Bard. <BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<H3>THE FINAL STAGES</H3>
Once you've reached the village in the
middle of Long Lake island, you'll meet<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!-- Column 2 -->
the Bard with his bow and arrow. This is
the only weapon that can kill the dragon
and the Bard is the only person with the
strength to use it, so tell the Bard to go
North, then follow him. After a while
he'll stop at a point where there is no exit
in that direction. Tell him to go up, follow
him, then continue north. <BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	When you encounter the dragon, tell
the Bard to shoot it. This leaves the way<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!-- Column 3 -->
open for you to take the treasure from the
dragon's halls and escape. <BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<H3>THE LONG WAY HOME</H3>
Head south, back the way you came, until
you reach the fountain. It's rumoured
that there is in fact a way back through the
fountain itself - but after spending hours
trying, the method still eludes me. The
only alternative seems to be to go along
the Forest Road. Those of you who have
already tried this particular stretch will
have realised the difficulty of negotiating
it without finding something dropping on
your head and stinging you to death. The
solution is to wait twice in each location.
Once through all that, getting home is
pretty straightforward. The adventure is
completed by the act of putting the treasure in the chest.

<I>The Hobbit</I> - waiting at the magic door has a
familiar ring to it.
 <i>(Unknown in Your Spectrum issue 11)</i> 

<br><hr>
	A fair number of you are still having
problems killing off Smaug (the dragon) in
<I>The Hobbit</I>. Well, <B>Helgi Hafthorsson</B> from
Iceland (how did you guess?) has settled
this problem once and for all with his tip.
Go to the village&nbsp;of Lake Town and tell the
Bard to go North. From here you must
follow him up to the mountain until you see
the dragon. You're far too weak to kill the
dragon yourself, so you must ask the Bard
to shoot it for you.
 <i>(Helgi Hafthorsson in Your Spectrum issue 20)</i> 

<br><hr>
THE GOBLIN'S Dungeon
raises its ugly head again! This
is one of the most vexing of
all the puzzles in the Hobbit,
and a location in which many
people (including myself!) get
stuck for a long time.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Mr B M Harris of Pinner is
the latest - ask for HELP,
Mr Harris, and you'll be told
that "A WINDOW SHOULD
BE NO OBSTACLE TO A
THIEF WITH FRIENDS". In
the book of the Hobbit,
Bilbo is sometimes called, by
other characters, "a thief".
And if you should have a
"friend" with you in the
Dungeon, he may help you. It
is a good idea, though, to
make yourself a little lighter,
maybe by eating any food
you have with you?
 <i>(Tony Bridge in Micro Adventurer issue 09)</i> 

<br><hr>
	From Bardufoss in Norway,
Einar Nilsen writes: "I would
be most grateful if you could
give me some guidance on The
Hobbit. How do I cross the
Black River? And how do I get
through the Magic Door in
Elvenking's Hall?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	At the Black River, Einar,
you must have the Rope from
earlier in the adventure. Then
try LOOK ACROSS RIVER
- then THROW ROPE, and
PULL ROPE. This will snare
the boat, and pull it back to
you. Theh CLIMB INTO
BOAT. It will move across the
River, and then you CLIMB
OUT. To get through the
Magic Door, you will need to
be wearing the Ring. Then
EXAMINE DOOR. You will
have to wait a turn or two now,
and then the Door will open.
Actually, in The Hobbit, you
will find that it is often a good
idea to WAIT every once in a
while.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	J Dyton of Milton Keynes
also writes asking for help in
The Hobbit. "I am stuck in the
Goblin's Dungeon and I
cannot exit through the
window. I am also stuck in the
Elven King's Dungeon, and
cannot get out alive. Every time
I try, I get swept against the
Portcullis. I cannot avoid
being killed by the Pale
Bulbous Eyes. And I cannot
find the boat to cross the
river.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Well, J Dyton, you have
covered just about all the
problems that any Hobbit
encounters in the first part of
the game! Your problem with
the boat should have been
answered earlier (or at least
point you in the right
direction).<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	The Goblin's Dungeon, I'm
afraid, is the classic Hobbit
problem - everyone
(including myself!) has been
stuck here at one time or
another. But ask the program
for Help and you will get a
good clue. You must ask
someone else to lift you up;
Hobbits are small after all! It is
important not to carry too
much at this point, or you will
weigh too much to be lifted -
and don't forget to OPEN the
window before trying to GO
THROUGH.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	The Elven King's Dungeon
is straightforward to escape
from, IF you have the right
objects with you. You'll notice
that the door is red, so it&nbsp;would
make sense to find a Red Key.
If you have the Ring with you,
then wear that. However,
while you may escape rather
easily, you will have a hard
time finishing the adventure
without Thorin, so you would
be well advised to help him
escape too.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Read the book carefully to
find the method of getting
through the Trapdoor, away
from the Butler, who will be a
problem immediately after
getting through the Red Door.
Then, making sure that you are
wearing the Golden Ring,
which makes you invisible
(again, read the book), help
Thorin to escape before you in
the same way.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	To escape death from the
Pale Bulbous Eyes - which
belong to the Necromancer -
all that needs to be done is to
WAIT! Actually, you need to
WAIT twice, then move East
to West. If the Necromancer
follows you, you may have to
WAIT again in the next
location.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	After looking at these clues,
the Hobbit-less reader may
have gained some idea of the
complexity of this Adventure.
So much depends on what has
been done or discovered
before! Regular readers of this
column may also be wondering
why I have not employed the
usual code in giving the clues.
Melbourne House has recently
released a book, called A
Guide to Playing the Hobbit,
which is exactly that. It is a
measure of The Hobbit's
sophistication that a book like
this can be written without
spoiling the adventure. If you
are playing the adventure, buy
the book, and if you have
completed the adventure, still
buy it, because it will show you
more ways of playing the
game.

	A final word on The Hobbit,
perhaps, to an anonymous
adventurer [...] who cannot pass the "bulbous eyes".
Try 2-13-29-4-19-7; 34-39-36;
2-13-29-4-19-7. This should do
it!

<TR><TD>I have found what may be a bug in the program when typing entries into the computer. Reader Hardman, who claims to have finished The Hobbit, warned me about the potential problem. Try typing DO in reply to the program prompt. The program seems to read a variety of responses and put them all on the screen. If you type-in DOW, according to Hardman, your program could crash.
