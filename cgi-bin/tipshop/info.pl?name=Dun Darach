<TR><TD>There are four picture galleries and each
of the pictures matches up with an object.
In room one, you'll need an arrow, an
adze, a hoe and a needle. You'll then be
presented with a broach that you should
give to Pita. In exchange, she'll tell you
that &quot;Rats are not rain&quot; - a hint that you
should follow the rat when you see it. It'll
take you to a secret door where you'll
find the jailer.
 <i>(Paul Allan in Your Spectrum issue 18)</i> 

<br><hr>
This quick starter
comes from <B>P. Bradford</B> of
Nottingham, who tells me,
&quot;Go to the casino and make
some money.&quot; Easy? Yep! All
you do is take your 2000 iridi
into the casino, and then Save
the game! Then, place your
bet on the 2-1 table; if you
lose the bet, all you do is
reload the saved position and
replace your bet until you win.
But that's almost cheating
and you know what I think of
that! Just this once though -
now go to the bank and
deposit most of the&nbsp;money,
avoiding pickpockets. <BR>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Go to the Thieves' Guild
and buy a licence for 10,000
iridi. Keep the asterisk on the
licence to avoid being
'mugged'. Go to the Minstrel
at 10 Old Hill, and buy a lyre
for 1,000 iridi. When you
meet Dain, behind the
invisible door on Park Row,
give him the lyre, and he will
give you the shield. Take the
shield to 'Hail Midir' at 35
Marsh Street, drop it on the
altar, and pick up the M-key.
You can use this to let you
through the invisible&nbsp;door on
Cross Street, opposite number
55, and obtain the Tele-stone.
Go to the Strong Room at 1
North Wall, and get the pearl.
Once outside the Strong
Room, the licence can be
discarded. To avoid mugging,
though, put the asterisk
against the Tele-stone.
 <i>(P Bradford in Your Spectrum issue 19)</i> 

<br><hr>
Go to the Magick Shop on
Cinder Bank, and buy a spell
for 1000Ir. Press 'offer' to
activate the Tele-stone, and
it'll show you where Skar is.
When she's passing you,
quickly change the asterisk to
the spell and offer it to Skar.
She'll say&nbsp;&quot;I am seen&quot;, and
now you'll be able to see her
all the time. Now offer her the
pearl, and she'll give you a
scroll saying 2**25. In old
fashioned ZX Basic this is 2 to
the power of 25. The answer
to this is 33554432. Make a
note of this, as it is an
important clue. Go to 3 North
Wall, and buy a statue. That'll
set you back 600Ir. Take the
statue to Teth on Claw Lane -
just follow the rat! When you
give the statue to Teth, he'll
offer you the D-key in return.
With it you can pass through
the door in the north of the
Castle, hence the clue &quot;Teth is
jailer&quot;. Drop objects on the
three altars, under the
spinning letters to spell D.P.E.
The door to the right of the
screen will now be unlocked.
Go&nbsp;through this door,
retaining the 2**25 scroll plus
one other object.
 <i>(P Bradford in Your Spectrum issue 20)</i> 

<br><hr>
	Go through the next door
(bet you've tried that by  now,
haven't you?) and you'll be
presented with a row of six
doors (row A). Take the third
door to row B. Third door
again and you're on row C.
Now take the fifth door and
you'll come to&nbsp;row D. From
row D, it's the fifth door.
Betcha reckon all this took
ages to work out! Nah, the
2**25 scroll from last month
- and before you load up
your <I>YS Megabasic</I>, that
works out at 33554432 -
gives you the route to take. So
from row A, we took door 3,
then door 3, then door 5 and
so on. Easy enough. <BR>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Once you get to the end of
the row of doors, you should
be faced with a normal door.
Inside, spell out the word O A
K and pick-up the L-key. Find
Loeg and give&nbsp;it to him and he
will say &quot;Fair exchange - let's
go ...&quot; and witter on much
like I do. Now go to South
Gate on Claw Lane. Make
sure you put the asterisk on
another object besides the L-
key or the pickpockets will get
it. Use the&nbsp;Portal to get to the
Soke and go through the
South Gate for the final
message. And that's it -
thanks a million 'P' - couldn'
have done it without you!
 <i>(P Bradford, Charlie Morgan in Your Spectrum issue 21)</i> 

<br><hr>
	So now I've given the game
away, I might as well add
insults to information and tell
you what <B>Charlie Morgan</B>
thought of the game. First, he
thought the ending was a bit
of an anti-climax - the final
message is just &quot;The End. Ta
from GG!&quot;. Worse, you don't
even have to free Loeg from
jail to finish the game (ah, but
it's more fun than just
finishing it!) There's also a
trawler full of red-herrings -
deliberate or a last minute
rush asks our man in
Croydon? <BR>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Two examples; entry to
Laydos is with the spell &quot;Show
the lady&quot; - you'll get the
message &quot;forbidden&quot;.
Gargoyle says this is because
there's all sorts of naughty,
naughty goings on inside
Laydos. But if you can't get in,
why is it there at all? To enter
21 Cinder Bank you need
&quot;Gold in Ashes&quot;. Inside is a
Pyrite which no one in the
game wants and therefore
seems to be of no use
whatsoever.

<br><hr>
Paul of Polesworth passed on news of his stay within the walls of Dun Darach. Here, there are many secret doors which may be found in the blank walls which carry torches.
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"First," says Paul, "obtain a book from the shop in King Street. Give it to the Lady Mhor and she will give one in return. That will open the secret door in Myre Street. The shield found hidden here can be offered to the great Goddess Danu. Now, on Old Hill you may get a lyre. Dain, who dwells behind the ever-open secret door in Park Row, will exchange that lyre of a shield sacred to Midir. Offer it to the god and you shall receive a key."
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much money may be made in this sorcerous place. "This is simple, O Large One. Take gold from the Assayers in West Way and sell it to the brokers in Cross Street. There are other means but that is easiest. But beware the thieves they will always take the possession you have placed your star beside. Thus it is safer never to place your star on a valued object - leave it on your stock of Iridi which can be easily replaced."
