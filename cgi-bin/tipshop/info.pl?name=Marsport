<TR><TD>The first thing to do is get a
weapon. Go In the down tube on
Coma D2 to the Elis level. Then go
to G2 on this level and get a gun
permit from the supply unit. Take
the adjacent tube to the Daly level.
Now go to D2 on this level and put
the gun permit in the key unit. You
can now take the power gun from
the locker. If you go to the infomat
on F3, you will get a clue as to what
makes the cake. The actual items
are: water (Dl), baking tin (A3), and
flour (C2). These can be joined by putting
them in the factor unit on F3. The
cake you receive gives you access
to the bakery. The dough in the
bakery can be used later. Now take
the charcoal from G1 and then get
down to Elis from G2. Go to C3 and
enter the danger room. Take the
bomb from the supply unit and
shove it down the refuse shute to
disarm it. You're now in sector H.
Go to H3, NOT H4, and take the
down tube to the Joly level. Get the
gauze from the supply unit and
take the up tube to laxa level. Go to
C4 where the vidtex says 'Danger!
Use filter to breathe'. Put the gauze
and charcoal in the factor unit to
make a gas mask. Enter the danger
room, and the mask will protect
you. Leave it in the locker for
further use.
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enter the danger room and the gas
mask will protect you. Leave it in the
locker for future use. Now go to A1 and
enter Ice Cream. The cornet gives
access to the Music room on Farr level
A1 and the ice pack gives access to the
Hot House on Gill level C1.&nbsp;You'll find a
mute and a lute in the Music room -
reserve these for future use. Go to the
map room on Iaxa G1 and take the
Earth map - this is the key to the Soil
Depot on Gill level. From Gill A3 you
can take the up tube to Alba level. If&nbsp;you
look around Alba you'll find four Vidtex
screens: these'll give you clues about
objects you'll need to get you through
the Astronomy room safely. 'My first Is
what surrounds' - this is the frame
from Iaxa E1. 'My second is the centre'
- this is the sunchart from the map
room. 'My third is clear to see' - this is
the glass from Iaxa H4. 'Put together it's
safe to enter' - this means factorise
these objects to make an eyeshleld -
use this to go through the Astronomy
room.
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From I3 take the down tube to Byer
level. In the Oratory you'll find a dais,
manifesto, pointe and projector.
These'll come in useful later so don't
lose them. You'll find the Bankers on
Byer level, (the key's the dough from
the Bakery on Daly level) where you'll
find the 2nd key to M-Central. The 1st
key's on Alba D1 in the director's office.
Take the down tube from Byer C3 to get
to the Joly level. Enter the safety room
and get the boots and earmuffs - the
boots give access to the Chemists on
Daly C3. The earmuffs give safe
passage through the danger room on
Gill B1. To get through the Radiation
room on Byer, combine the lute and the
dais, an anagram of lead suit! To get to
Coma level take the up tube on Gill F4.
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go to Coma A2 and you'll see a
room with a punctured outer wall. To
get through here safely get the oxygen
from the Chemists and the empty tank
from Alba A1. Factorise these to get an
air tank - take this beck to Coma A2
and proceed through the danger room.
(It's best at this point if you have the
steps from B4 and the machines from
Byer level.) Now go to Coma G2 and
take the down tube to Farr level. The
3rd key to M-Central leon Parr G2. Go
to G3 and enter the Games room. Here
you get a Vidtex message: "The key is
the game; the game is the key.' Put the
steps and the machines in the factorto
make a game. (The machines are
calculators, which are adders, which
are snakes - snakes and ladders!
Geddit?) Put&nbsp;the game In the key unit
and proceed out of the exit. On Farr C3
there is a down tube to Hale level. With
all three M-Central keys take this route:
go to A3 and enter Control. Put key 1 in
the key unit. Now go to H4 and put in
the 2nd and 3rd keys. You may now
enter M-Centrai. Proceed to the other
exit and you'll get 99% and will have
completed Phase 1.
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phase
II. Now you can enter all the 'restricted'
doors and you'll find the codices T, W,
E, I, 6, and N. To unlock the BAR&nbsp;on
Farr E3 you need the Mars Map - Mars
Bar - geddit? You'll
find within the tea and strainer. Take
the tea, the insect from Gill D4 and the
pointe from the Oratory on Byer level.
Put them all in a factor unit to get the
antidote. This'll allow you access
through the Danger room on Coma E2.
To get through the plant room on Joly
H4, use the geranium from the
Hothouse. To enter the Boiler room on
Joly I4 use the kettle as a key. Get the
helmet from in here and the topee from
Byer level.
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because these are alien items, the
heralds come after you too! Put them
both in a factor unit to get the artifact
which is actually a Starlord's Power
Booster. Put this and the power gun
into a factor unitto receive the hyper
gun. (This shoots blue bolts of energy
instead of red ones.) The hyper gun
kills Sept Warlords as well as warriors,
so kill both warlords (one on Iaxa and
one on Elis)to get two more codices, D
and U. The sentry in the sanctum needs
five pairs for entry. Follow this
procedure:-
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Factorise -
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mute and manifesto	= e-token
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;strainer and sun chart	= n-token
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;projector and charcoal	= t-token
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cake and lead suit	= r-token
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;earmuffs and eyeshield	= y-token
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e+n+t+r+y = ENTRY, see?
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;N factorise all the tokens to get
the sanctum key. Then go to the
sanctum, put the key in the unit and
phase II is complete.
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phase III - the home straight. To
finish the game, you have to make use
of the codices. If you search around
you'll find a Vidtex screen which says '7
from 10 makes BIGHEAD'. This is a
cryptic clue to your escape route. The
codices are found on these levels: Alba
- N, Byer - H, Coma - I, Daly - W,
Elis - U, Farr - T, Gill -6, Hale - G,
Iaxa - D and Joly - E.
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now when you take the letters of
the word BIGHEAD, you get the initial of
one of the levels:
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;codex
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B (Byer) H
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I (Iaxa) D
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;G (Gill) 6
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;H (Hale) G
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E (Elis) U
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A (Alba) N
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D (Daly) W
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore the clue is H D6 GUN W.
This m should go to D6 on
Hale level, with plans of course, and
use your gun to shoot the west wall.
The wall will then flash and presto! an
up tube appears. Go from here to Coma
Level sector D. The spacefield is just
around the corner, 'The Siege Of Earth
Continues - Forward to Fornax!' And
that, as they say, is that."
