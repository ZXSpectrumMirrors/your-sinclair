<TR><TD>Philip James of North Wales has been examining the intricate and secret codes contained in System 15000. He has found a number attached to the name 'KP Codes' but can't grasp its significance. It is easy to become lost in this strange ritual but it is always wise to return to earlier contacts. If Philip uses this number at Kingsdown he'll discover much to his advantage. Also if you wish to get information from Selcra you must always place a message on the board first - enter&nbsp;'Selcra' followed by the name of the organisation.

As I browsed through my letters by the dying torchlight I found a number from warlocks trapped within System 15000, including Knifer Boon of Maldon, Stunner Johns of Houston and the doughty Pugh of Twyford. To help is difficult in this ritual since it is hard to know exactly how much you understand already. So I will provide some numbers.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calling Routledge will give important advice on those behind the swindle. Also Perry's specific code is VIN 15 - instead of INFRA - and will give further routes for your investigation. SELCRA will not reveal all about every company but follow the track of some large fruit and you may pip 537 at the post! Surely this is clear enough?

Fair Karen Mear asked advice of me about this ritual - she cannot force her way into the Midminster Bank. At Seastar Travel she will find a code to help her entry. Fair foreign exchange is no robbery.

If you're trying to
break the bank, a short
holiday may refresh you.
(You'd better watch out,
though, that it's not at Her
Majesty's pleasure!) Also,
watch out for Perry, there's
more to him than meets the
eye. As someone says, catch
you on the phones.

Further into the night the talk turned to the mystery of System 15000. Like others, Dave the Desperate and Maynard of Barford had had difficulty in using the services of Selcra. Again I say - to gain information, seekers must write SELCRA followed by the name of the company they are interested in on the System's message board. Those agents of darkness will only reveal information about a very few firms and you should not expect unlimited assistance.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that many more have broken the System's spell and I thank Egbert the Edbanger of Bristol and George Forsyth of Kingston for the advice they have given me.

Ranger Reid collared me to claim his title of Lord High System Breaker. He says that he has completed System 15000 after many weeks of hacking. Should any of you wish to know the solution - telephone him. He would not reveal the true number except in code. Break it and the System's secrets may be yours: (7+c)(8+e)(7+a)(8+e)(7+a)(6+i)(0+a)(8+e)(8+e)(1-b).
