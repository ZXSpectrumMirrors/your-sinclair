<TR><TD>You begin in deep trouble! The correct
password from Part I is needed which will
give you an item to cover your nudity and
may suggest a sharp intake of breath. Breath
is the last thing you need in a vacuum of
course so make sure you get rid of it if you
want to survive the next few moves. Time is
short, so don't stop to look at things just
yet, get to somewhere you can breathe.
<BR>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now you'll be able to examine things at
your leisure. A little exploration and examination will be a great help towards getting
some idea of what to do next and a bloom
so beautiful you'll get a crush on it will solve
a very old problem. If you remember that
lung size is proportional to body size,
psychotransfiguration may not seem so
much of a drag - if you keep your head
covered. You can move on with open eyes.
<BR>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once you've seen me, if you see what I
mean, you should reach that blinking field,
at last, to be confronted with yet another
problem. Don't worry, put it out of sight
and mind for a moment and take a bit of
exercise.
<BR>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life is a treadmill? sounds like a clue to
me! Of course you'll have to unravel
another mystery to tie this one up. If you
can push through this location and still hold
on, you'll have made a very significant
'move'.
<BR>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Things should really be dropping into
place now and so should you, providing you
have tied up all those loose ends.
<BR>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clutching an alien device and a few
threads of information to suggest a purpose
to the whole game you should be able to rid
yourself of a paradox - one that's blocking
your progress.
<BR>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last move is probably the most difficult in that it seems to need inspiration to
suggest it. After struggling for hours to use
some of the superfluous objects in the
game, I finally gave up until meeting Scott
at the PCW show - he told me I was only
two moves from the end!
<BR>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To push you in the right direction all I'll
say is that your two friends in Part I are your
friends in Part II as well, so don't be too
annoyed at one of them - he's just doing
his job and helping you do yours!
<BR>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final touch will yield a burst of
gibberish - but, with the aid of the card in
the software pack, everything will become
clear and the awesome scope of the task
you've just completed will be revealed. Of
course, if you've got a pirate copy, everything will be as clear as mud - but the
Americans have a term for that too -
Tough *?!@
