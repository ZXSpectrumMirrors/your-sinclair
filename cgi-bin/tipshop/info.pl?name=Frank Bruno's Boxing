<br><hr>
Through rain and shine, I battled my way through <I>Frank
Bruno's Boxing</I>. My head was
smashed in by the Canadian
Crusher and my ribs were decimated by Fling Long Chop.
But finally I came through and
KOed Peter Perfect - and for
what I ask? I'll tell you what -
a bit of cheap advertising for
<I>Scooby Doo</I> and a line about
extra boxers on a new tape! So
now my thoughts are so rebellious
to good ol' Franky and
the Elite mob that I've negotiated
with my pet do to dish
out the vibes to all the wimps
who can't play the big fist on
their own. First though, you'll
have to use my game name
JAY, before entering the following EVBA membership

<br><hr>
A FEW hints from the boys at Elite to help you fight your way to the Heavyweight Championship of the world, in Frank Bruno's Boxing:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadian Crusher reacts to your punches; deliver a body blow and the big dumbo will drop his guard to protect his body, switch now to the head and up will come his hands.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watch out for his right uppercut - with practice it's easy to avoid. Each time you knock him down, Crusher will attempt the bear hug, and to avoid him you must duck. Target KO Time - 35 secs.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fling Long Chop can dodge your head punches, he can also block head and body blows. The best tactic is to fight like fury and throw as many punches as you can.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each time he delivers a head kick he will drop to his left knee. You must duck and providing you do this he is not likely to hurt you. Target KO Time - 70 secs.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andra Puncheredov is fast and dangerous. Throw a string of right jabs and he will dodge about 70 per cent; keep them going and you will notice that he dodges to his right. Time to throw a left head punch.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watch out for dirty tricks; Andra will headbutt if he gets the chance, and if his head goes back, duck. Target KO Time - 1 min 45 secs.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Tribal Trouble, each punch you throw will bring instant retaliation. So wait with your guard down, and as he raises his fists to strike, deliver a body blow. You won't be able to hit him twice, so block his body blows and wait until once more he raises his guard.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will notice that Tribal Trouble goes into an Ali shuffle; don't under any circumstances hit him when he is in the down position as this will trigger his two-handed punch. Target KO Time - 2 mins.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frenchie is difficult to hit, and not terribly exciting. One aspect of Frenchie's style worth noting is his tendency to repeat blows. Give him an opportunity to deliver a head blow and he will repeat and repeat until you're on the floor.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watch out for Frenchie's windmill - from time to time he will wind himself up, pause momentarily  and then punch. Target Time 2 mins 15 secs.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fighting Ravioli Mafiosi is a battle of wits. His only weakness is a tendency to drop his right hand; at that point punch with your right. Ravioli will at first block with his left but after some blows his left will fall away and you're through. Don't fall for the come on, or the ending will be instantaneous. Target K0 Time - 2 mins 30 secs.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Antipodean Andy has one chink in his&nbsp;armour - when he leans to the left you can catch him with either a righthand head blow or a lefthand body blow.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immediately prior to unleashing a double fist punch Andy will raise both over his face. Target KO Time - 2 mins 45 secs.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peter Perfect is almost impossible to beat. You cannot land the by now all to familiar, righthand knockout drop; Peter sees it coming and dodges, every time. Target KO Time - you should be so lucky.
