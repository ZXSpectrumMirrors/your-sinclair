<TR><TD>The main sectors in Circus are the field in which you start, the road and car which you can reach, using Go road followed by Go car, and the circus exterior and interior where much of the action will take place. Each of those sectors is discussed in the hints and tips panel.
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the quests you will have to undertake is to find the petrol with which to fill your car to make your getaway. It could be in the generator which you will find near the circus or it could be in the dark depths of the tent. The generator is not working, so there is no power to go exploring in the tent. You will have to find your own, with a little help from hints and tips.
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secret of the petrol lies in the tent but you might like&nbsp;to explore the traps and pitfalls before you start to be involved with the quest. Learning from experience is usually the name of the game but there are some problems you can avoid with commonsense.
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may make a reasonable guess that most of the circus act equipment you find is in the tent and in the circus ring. The ladder you find hanging in mid-air. It seems to go up to the roof of the tent and is a temptation - if you ever wanted to swing on the trapeze you will find your wish granted if you can find the proper words to swing up to the top beams and canvas of the roof. If you jump from the trapeze you will land on the canvas of the roof and find nothing.
If you have a knife you could become a vandal, as&nbsp;the computer will accept the command to cut the canvas. Not much else seems to be possible from that vantage point and it is at that point, when you want to return to the ground, that you may have difficulty.
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may wish you had a map of&nbsp;the steps you took to get up to your precarious position. If you have not made a map you will become confused between ladders and swings. What you must not do is take out your rope, if you have it, and throw it. You might expect to find a quick way to the ground but the only thing you will get is a lost rope.
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other place to avoid is the human cannon, unless you are trying to escape from the clown who keeps appearing. That character does little damage but he is difficult&nbsp;to follow.
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One last strange, but useful, tip which can be given is that you should try and dig with your spade at every opportunity. No more said but you never know what you might discover.
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>HINTS AND TIPS</b><br>
Useful items hidden close to the hand.<br>
Dig with a spade in a field.<br>
Your car is not as useless as it seems.<br>
Look in the boot before you scream.<br>

<br><hr>
The snorkel syphons petrol from
the generator. The clown helps erect the net
- in the right place. You need slippers to
walk to the tightrope safely. "Fill tank"
gets the car ready to go.
 <i>(Tony Bridge, Ken Matthews in Micro Adventurer issue 14)</i> 

<br><hr>
In Circus, to get
started, GET SHOVEL, then
DIG FIELD. Here you will
find something to help you
later.
