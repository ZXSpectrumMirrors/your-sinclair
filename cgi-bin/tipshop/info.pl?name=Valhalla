<TR><TD>It is unwise to travel ring roads when you are a novice. You could get lost.
 <i>(Quentin Heath in Sinclair User issue 23)</i> 

<br><hr>
It may seem as if there are two sides to every coin. Only one side will help you win and evil is in its way.
 <i>(Quentin Heath in Sinclair User issue 23)</i> 

<br><hr>
To gain the first objective you will need to gain a friendship.
 <i>(Quentin Heath in Sinclair User issue 23)</i>

A map in my possession may help Sheila from the township of Cambridge - she seeks Drapnir the ring of power. There are Pits in Hel and if she journeys east from there to a cave she will be able to jump to another part of Hel. North of here&nbsp;lies Despair. North once more will bring her to the ring.
 <i>(Gordo Greatbelly in Sinclair User issue 34)</i> 

<br><hr>
	<I>Valhalla</I> is still proving popular with
callers, though some purists may argue
that it's more of an arcade game than
adventure. A fair proportion of the questions asked about <I>Valhalla</I> refer to
problems in finding Drapnir. No problem -
Drapnir is located north of Despair.
Something else that seems to be hampering apprentice adventurers is that, having
come across a chest or cupboard containing a quest object, there's no way to get
the blasted lock open. No offence, but
you're just too puny to attempt such
heavyweight tasks on your own - try
enlisting the help of a friendly God, such
as Bodir, to help you.
 <i>(Unknown in Your Spectrum issue 12)</i> 

<br><hr>
Drapnir is in a cave in Hell.
 <i>(Tony Bridge, Ken Matthews in Micro Adventurer issue 14)</i> 

<br><hr>

On reading Mike Stackwell's article in May's
<I>Micro Adventurer</I>, and examining the map,
I can only assume I have gone wrong somewhere. I already
had all the locations he showed plus the others which Ofnir
allows access to. The only part of the map I did not agree with
was where he shows a ringway from Krankle's Hall to location
number 6 - no way am I able to jump from there.
 <i>(Tony Bridge in Micro Adventurer issue 15)</i> 

<br><hr>
There was a misprint in early versions of <I>Valhalla</I> -
now there is no rignway from Rankle's Hall to any other location.
 <i>(Tony Bridge in Micro Adventurer issue 15)</i> 

<br><hr>
A map of Valhalla from
Andy MacGregor of Basingstoke enables us to tell those
still searching for Skornir;
start in El Vinos, then without
helmet, SE twice then north
(with Ofnir). This takes you to
Midgard from where you can
JUMP to a cave in Hell. Holding Drapnir but not Ofnir
allows you to go east twice. If
you have the shield you can go
east again to the location
where Skornir is concealed.
