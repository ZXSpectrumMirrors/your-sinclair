<TR><TD><I>Snowball</I> - with its nightingales and
waldroids proving the major barriers to
sanity. (By the way, if you're having trouble getting up the uni-slime ramp, go and
nab the cat, drop it on the ramp and
watch it clear the way for you by slurping
up all the slime. Yuch!)

	Level 9 adventures seem to keep most
of the adventuring nation awake at
nights. <B>Dave Deals</B> of Sunderland can't
get the can of paint through the air-lock.
Aha, <I>Snowball</I>, I hear you say. Well, the
answer is to put the can into&nbsp;the tool-box
and carry on as normal. Another problem with this adventure game came from
<B>Mr Tam</B> of Wallasy who wanted to know
how to use the screen. Try wearing your
visor, Mr Tam!

When you're in danger
type 'P' and you'll find
yourself in an asylum.
To escape you'll have to
type 'Pull Machine' and
Enter, then retype 'Pull
Machine'.

From the
coffin at the start, go Up and
then North and then into the
passage and head East. You
could try saying "Sesame"
occasionally! The Nightingales
will only enter blue mortuaries
on the white level. I can't be of
much more help without
knowing details  of the
problems, but there are various
bits of apparatus to assemble,
in a quite logical way, and a
very important code to crack.

To escape the Nightingales, N,
PRESS ANY 3 BUTTONS, S, U, U. Nightingales don't enter rooms on this level. To
enter the Habidome you must get the code
by waking a crew member. You need to
crack the mortuary colour code to find the
right coffin. Check the video viewer. The
codes are different each time you play.

<B>A Snowball's chance in deepest space</B>
<BR><BR>
<I>Galactic agent <B>Ken Matthews</B> tackles murderous robots, the perils
of cold sleep, and
a crazed saboteur in Level 9's epic</I> Snowball.
<BR><BR>
I SCREAM aloud and thrash wildly as I
awake to find myself in a padded coffin
with no apparent exit. Fortunately, my
frantic movements nudge a previously unseen lever, the coffin opens and light floods
in.
<BR>
	Reason penetrates my sleep numbed
brain and I realise that I'm aboard the colony ship Snowball 9 bound for the new
world of Eridani A. The fact that I'm alone
means that something is terribly wrong -
the 1.8 million passengers sleep on.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above is my interpretation of the
opening moves of Pete Austin's epic
<I>Snowball</I>, a well structured, all-text adventure set in the twenty third century and
based, in part, on Larry Niven's novel <I>The
Mote in God's Eye</I>. Unlike most, the
adventure loses nothing from its lack of
graphics  since,  like  Infocom games,
descriptions are very thorough and allow
full scope to the player's own imagination.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You take the part of Kim Kimberley, a
secret agent, placed aboard without the
crew's knowledge to take over in an
emergency, which is, of course, just what's
happened. Armed, initially, with only an
elegant backless hospital gown you must
divert the ship from its collision course with
the alien sun of the new Eden.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The background for the adventure is
covered extremely well in the twelve page
booklet accompanying the game and a
description of the Snowball itself means
that you can have at least some idea of
where to go from the start. Basically the
Snowball consists of ten vast, rotating
'freezer discs', each containing 180,000
sleeping colonists. These discs are enclosed
in a vast shell of ammonia ice, to both protect the passengers and serve as fuel for the
giant fusion engines. Freezer control and
other services are mounted on the outer surface of the shell. This huge ecosystem is
attached to the motor unit and control room
by a vast cable network called the 'Web'
which incorporates 'Jacob's Ladder', a
system to allow transport of personnel and
fuel to&nbsp;the motor unit.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the adventurer, the first challenge is
to escape from the mortuary levels. You
soon realise the freezer systems have
detected your early awakening and have
despatched the robot Nightingales to put
you back to sleep - permanently! To aid
your escape, and for later, it is useful to
crack the colour code of the indicator lights
scattered about the mortuary levels - electronics enthusiasts  should  have  little
trouble.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several lives later, you will elude the
syringe- wielding Nightingales and collapse
breathlessly into an elevator on the floor
above. From here, it is easy to find your
way to the sealed off Freezer Control,
hopefully clutching your trusty, airtight
toolbox. As you wander around you will
find two usable exits, the first leading to a
massage parlour (maybe, after all that
sleep, a quick rub down might be invigorating!) and the other to open space
which, without a space suit, is inevitably
fatal. The only one who seems to know
where he's going is the scruffy little cleaning droid ...
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now at the centre of things in Freezer
Control the mystery unfolds with the
discovery of the dead body of a ship's officer. Still, every cloud etc. and you find
yourself a few useful items the richer.
You're sure the screen would provide some
useful clues if only you can get the blinking
thing to work after looking at it for ages!
Exploring the living quarters makes you
even better equipped to continue your mission. The library finally points out your
next step and adds to your battery of equipment. Lentil custard might seem rather
useless now but would have been welcome
when you'd just woken up.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pretty soon you return&nbsp;to this area, codes
and Nightingales hopefully dispensed with
to deal with more of the electronic denizens
of this floating world. Two problems face
you at this stage in the form of one ailing
droid and several bureaucratic ones each
needing to be satisfied in its own way. You
can play with the paper-pushers all you like
but the damaged droid has only a short
time to go! Still, at least now you're equipped to go outside.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once on the outside you soon find
yourself climbing round on the seemingly
endless web of cables connecting the
Snowball to its drive unit. The suit air is
limited and you'd best make a positive
move quite quickly. A certain step in the
right direction leaves you floating in space
and approaching the ice field at fatal speed
- any hint given here would be a shot in
the dark!
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You next encounter the monorail system
which provides simple access to several
useful locations such as the Habidome,
Robodome, Warehouse and the route to
the motor unit / control room. Getting to
these locations and the items they contain
will be no problem to the, by now, experienced Kim Kimberley but two major
challenges present themselves in the form
of a broken down Snowdozer that must be
repaired and sent on its way, and a deadly
waldroid (controlled remotely by the
saboteur) which prevents your access to
Jacob's Ladder. Assembling the items to
repair the Snowdozer is quite straightforward, providing you've discovered how
to replenish your air supply, but the
waldroid must be disabled and this is no
mean task - if you can crack this one
you'll be painting the town tonight.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eventually though you will reach the top
of the ladder and find the base of the drive
unit / control room. Here you encounter the
villain's second line of defence which, while
not a patch on the first, still requires a purrfect solution to get you past it.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last! You've reached the control area
but don't get carried away - a little caution will prevent a real roasting from a
hidden laser. You must reflect carefully before
making your next move.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final problem faces you! A crazed,
armed saboteur when you'd expected a fanfare or similar accolade! Still forewarned is
forearmed and in a quick flurry of moves
the Snowball is safe.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above is not a solution but one of
several scenarios that might apply during
the playing of <I>Snowball</I> and hopefully gives
some idea of the drama that builds up during a game session - part of what makes
Level 9 games interesting and absorbing. It
really is easy to imagine your role as the
main character in a novel. The storyline
presented above gives only a suggestion of
the possibilities open to the player and a
few hints to the more abstract problems. A
huge amount of descriptive narrative has
been omitted, together with the location of
almost all items and the simpler problems
that need to be solved to obtain them, to
allow you, the player, to discover for
yourself the intriguing worlds of Level 9.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are new to Level 9 adventures you
will find that careful mapping and examination of ALL items will pay dividends.
Use&nbsp;of items is made easy by the extended
vocabulary of over 200 words and the program's ability to search a complicated
command sentence and guess at your meaning.
This alone makes <I>Snowball</I> worth playing
when compared to other adventures where
hours that could be spent problem solving
are wasted in a frustrated search to find a
command the program understands. This
command analyser is a refreshing improvement over Level 9's Middle Earth Trilogy
- <I>Dungeon Adventure</I>&nbsp;didn't understand
'GET'!
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every item in <I>Snowball</I> can be used, but
some needn't be, and although points are
scored and lost, there are no treasures to
collect, only your mission to complete -
believe me, that's enough!
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbspgame itself comes attractively and
sturdily packed to be Post Office proof.
The accompanying booklet contains a first
class introduction to the adventure and
boasts artwork usually reserved for the better role playing games. It is well produced,
comprehensive and free of typographical
errors - which is not true of the spelling in
the game itself. My copy loaded first time
but is backed up on side two just in case.
Also included is a voucher entitling the
buyer to a free clue, but I'm told you now
receive a complete hint sheet in return for
your SAE - not that you'll need it given this
review and Tony Bridge.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, I believe that Level 9 adventures leave Scott Adams and others far
behind and are matched in concept, design
and implementation only by Infocom and
to some extent Melbourne House. Before
you all write in in praise of Scott et al, this
is not intended as a criticism - indeed I
was weaned on Adventures 1-12 - but as a
suggestion that the adventure game has
evolved to allow more interaction between
us and the programs we love. Level 9 certainly seem to be the British leaders in this
field.<br>
