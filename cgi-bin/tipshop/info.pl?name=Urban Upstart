<TR><TD>My thanks to Mark Talbot, an initiate of great skill from the temple of Surclaif at Loughborough. He has sent me the map to Scarthorpe, that forbidden city of despair. Other students of Urban Upstart should take note - if you do not carry a book on the art of flying with you you will never escape from this dismal place of ruins. The key will also be necessary.

Owen of the Oval Sphere from Bangor had tried long and hard to enter a town hall in ill-famed Scarthorpe home of the Urban Upstart. Beware bureaucrats young sir - all they need is red tape. Take some with you.
 <i>(Gordo Greatbelly in Sinclair User issue 38)</i> 

<br><hr>
<B>Alan Pitt</B> of
Great Yarmouth has written
in to find out how he can get
into the town hall to collect
the red tape. And what does
he do with it once he's got
his grubby mitts on it? Well,
we can't answer the first
question, Alan, but you'll
need to keep the tape handy
when you try to break into
the mansion. That info was
sent in by <B>Mark Thomas</B> so
perhaps you'd better get in
touch with him to find the
solution to your first
problem. <BR>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Mark has also sent in the
following clues to solve any
financial problems you have.
(<I>I wish he'd come and solve mine! Ed</I>) First, you've got
the rather unsavoury task of
rifling through the dustbins
where you'll find a letter and
a cashcard. In the letter
you'll find a number that you
should then go to the telephone box and dial. That
way you'll be given a cash
account number. Now, and
you've probably sussed this
already, you must take the
card to the bank, type the
number and you'll be given
&#163;5.
 <i>(Mark Thomas in Your Spectrum issue 18)</i>

In Urban Upstart,
you will need 22-20 to get past
the guard and 11-1 to enter the
Town Hall.

To get out of Jail, bide
your time. To get out of Hospital, you
need a disguise. Make sure you have
protection from the rain. Milk may have an
enervating effect, although the football fan
may appreciate something a little stronger!
 <i>(Tony Bridge, Ken Matthews in Micro Adventurer issue 14)</i> 

<br><hr>
Skinhead of Mordor grumbled that he could not kill the rats which infest parts of that dismal town. As far as I know, rodent extermination is not necessary to success. The cheese may help you escape imprisonment if eaten.
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brak Beamish of Horsell gave us all some useful tips but, despite his knowledge, could not persuade the airport officers to let him through to his craft. Two things are necessary - any pilot must have the required papers to leave the town but also should brighten the officers' tedious day with a suitable bribe.
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was of no use to Lone Wulf of Fife who had not even been able to find any money, though he had traced the machine that dispenses it. People are careless, Wulf, and will drop the&nbsp;strangest things into dustbins and rubbish piles. Read all letters with care and your trouble may soon end.
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;El-Mokadem of Farnham made careful notes of what was said but asked where the flying suit might be. Perhaps it was left to dry on some pipes?
