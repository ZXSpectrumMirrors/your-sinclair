raise and then lower. In another location,

<br><hr>

	Scott's next adventure, <I>The Count</I>, is also
in a supernatural vein and you begin, again,
in a castle - but this time in bed - at mid-
afternoon. Actually you are in sunny
Transylvania at the home of its most famous
resident - Count&nbsp;Dracula! You have been
sent by the local townspeople to rid them of
the nocturnal terror and woe betide you if
you try to leave without completing your
mission.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wandering around, you might begin by
visiting the bathroom for a bit of light relief
before finding your way to the kitchen.
There you will discover a solar oven that's
too hot to enter and a dumb-waiter. If you
stand and wait for it to talk, you'll wait
forever - it's a lift!
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few ups and downs you will have
several useful items to your credit and be
faced with two problems in the form of a
locked door and a rather dark pit. The rings
should give you a clue to the latter and a
letter to the former but you'll need to have
your wits about you to make a rope. You
can't force your way through the door - a
little more subtlety is called for - what's
that noise? - you'd better answer the door-
bell!
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After reading the note and postcard you
should be able to pick your way forward
and enter the cupboard. You won't finish
your quest in just one evening so you might
consider putting your treasured possessions
in a safe place before you fall asleep -
eventually. If you can keep awake you
might cast a little light on the subject of the
oven.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you haven't already you might take a
little look outside your bedroom window
before you retire and being a bit more
adventurous - like you were in the
dungeon - could help solve your filing
problems&nbsp;tomorrow.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh No! - You've been bitten!! - by the
looks of those marks it wasn't a mosquito!
Still, it couldn't be avoided - even adventurers must sleep sometimes. You'll have to
be quick though - go and see how ill you
look! - make sure that pesky bat doesn't
have the last laugh. You could do worse
than wait for the postman since I'm sure
you'll have found everything useful by now.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smoking is usually bad for your health
but in this case a little coffin' might do you
some good. A quick pint might see you
through another night but business should
come before pleasure and you should bolt
down to the crypt and finish off your filing
- even if you have to work a little late.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You should awake a little less drained this
time and feel up to the last step in your
plan. At last you can strike the final
blow and face the townspeople - you
may be pleasantly surprised.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, The Count presents new challenges to the adventurer and requires a little
more lateral thinking than the first four. I
feel it is the ideal introduction to Scott's
later adventures which,  intentionally,
become increasingly difficult with more
abstract problems being introduced all the
time.<br>
