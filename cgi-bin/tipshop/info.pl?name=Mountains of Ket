<TR><TD>Within a few moves from the start of Mountains of Ket there is a hint about hearing voices nearby. Listen carefully at that point and you will receive a password which will pacify a dangerous orc sentinel at a later stage.
 <i>(Richard Price in Sinclair User issue 35)</i> 

<br><hr>
One Bonecrusher Singleton of Derby had found a large dog near the orc's sleeping place and could see no way to use the beast.
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my experience animals only need feeding to make them docile and a chain and pillar to tie them up - they will&nbsp;then make excellent treasure guards and will keep rats and orcs at bay. This somewhat singed adventurer also had great trouble with a dragon who lived in the mountain. Pour oil on troubled reptiles, young Bonecrusher!
 <i>(Gordo Greatbelly in Sinclair User issue 35)</i> 

<br><hr>
The great skull which protects the mountain has proved an obstacle to many. Thorne the Slayer from Mansfield cannot pass. Her Holiness told me she had visited this hellish place years ago and the only way to enter was in a priest's clothing, hat, cloak and beard.
 <i>(Gordo Greatbelly in Sinclair User issue 35)</i> 

<br><hr>
And so the talk came round to Ket, favoured by many. Puncher Parsons has had regular encounters with the Zombie who prevents exit from the mountain caverns. There were many voices in reply. Our solution was that he should drop all but his sword and magic staff and, after donning his armour and ring, should go on.
 <i>(Gordo Greatbelly in Sinclair User issue 37)</i> 

<br><hr>
In
<I>The Mountains of Ket</I> he
recommends that you
wave your wand and say
'Polo' to get round the
wall - well, it is in mint
condition!
 <i>(James Elliot in Your Spectrum issue 16)</i> 

<br><hr>
[to get through the chamber with the Huge Zombie]
You must have with you the four magical items:
the magic wand, magic ring, magic armour and magic
sword. You must drop everything else!
 <i>(Tony Bridge in Micro Adventurer issue 13)</i> 

<br><hr>
avoid the goblin by
moving till you've lost him, then double
back. To enter the Skull you must wear the
wizard's hat, cloak and beard. To pass the
zombie, drop all except sword and wand,
wear armour and ring, then go down.
 <i>(Tony Bridge, Ken Matthews in Micro Adventurer issue 14)</i> 

<br><hr>
Mrs Mairi Marshall has written to me recently, asking for
help in [...] Mountains of
Ket, as she can't get past the
Skull. This is very near the
end, Mairi, and you must, as
the clue says "be a wizard".
Try wearing all the wizard-like
things that you should have
collected in your travels.
 <i>(Tony Bridge, Ken Matthews in Micro Adventurer issue 15)</i> 

<br><hr>
First the ogre beyond the pool in the Mountain of Ket. Try as she might she could not get him to dice with her. I suggested that she might need to read the Goblin Gazette before so doing as this ogre is publicity conscious.
