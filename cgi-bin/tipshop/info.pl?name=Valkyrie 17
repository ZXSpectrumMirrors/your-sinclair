<TR><TD>If your game has graphic illustrations of the locations study them carefully - clues could well be present, especially if it is a program with pictures which alter after relevant commands. At a lonely snow-bound hut in Valkyrie 17 the picture contains the only clue that essential objects are present.

Gunman Guntrip of Abingdon has not rested from Valkyrie 17. He cannot obtain the lamb from the savage butcher. Do you remember a lead box, Gunman? Fatal to you, it may equally be so to this terrible tradesman.

	Moving on, the Green Goblin, Peter
Shaw (still trapped in the bowels of Castle Rathbone, stapled to the YS
Helpline) has some hints and tips for those still
floundering around with Ram Jam's <I>Valkyrie 17</I>.<BR>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	According to ol' Green Fingers, the
woman in the bar of the hotel is not actually a woman at all, but a male agent in
drag! This may suggest the idea of stealing his wig, etc, and making an escape
from the hotel in disguise ... but, unfortunately, this just won't work. What you
have to do instead is collect the sheets
from the laundry room on the first floor
and move down to the window at the end
of the corridor. Here, you have to open
the window and climb out on to the
ledge. Make a rope out of the sheets you
have and move around the ledge until
you can find something to tie the sheets
on to. Then, you can climb down and
wander around the town.<BR>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	But what's the use of hitting the town
without any money? Luckily, there's a
safe&nbsp;in one of the rooms, which you'll
need to prise open with the object inside
the glass case in the infirmary. Of course,
you'll have to break the case, but if you
look around the room under construction you should find the odd piece of rubble.
Need I say more!

	First, off, let's hear from <B>Rich Filfghbert</B> in Sweden.
He can't work out how to
get skiing in <I>Valkyrie 17</I>. OK, Rich, it's
like this - type in 'READ BOOK,
WEAR SKIS' and make sure you've got
those ski poles handy, and away you go!
Don't break a leg, Rich!<BR>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Another problem that's cropped up in
<I>Valkyrie 17</I> is how and where to obtain
money. Well, for a start, you could
always naff off down to the village and
pawn that necklace that's lying around!
 <i>(Unknown in Your Spectrum issue 13)</i> 

<br><hr>
	<I>Valkyrie 17</I> has stretched
a few minds, but <B>Erik Gaspard</B> of Belgium has got
the measure of it. He
suggests that when you're
leaving Schloss Drakenfeld
SPRAY the security camera
with shaving foam. A few
more words that could
come in useful are SHAKE
for the pedestal if you can't
reach the Valkyrie diamond,
and if you need a gun,
EXAMINE the CORNERS
in the cellar. If you still
haven't cracked the code
word for the room with the
diamond, try Drakenfeld.
 <i>(Erik Gaspard in Your Spectrum issue 17)</i> 

<br><hr>
Behind the dustbins in
the Schloss, apparently, you'll find an aqualung which you'd be well advised to take.
Also, give the butcher the lead-box and
hide Reichmuller's body in the shower.
 <i>(Peter Bates, Freddie Still in Your Spectrum issue 20)</i> 

<br><hr>
Alex the Messenger of Solihull followed me out for a breath of air and confided he could not leave his hotel whilst hunting Valkyrie 17. The window will provide an exit but Alex must first move along the ledge, explore the other room there&nbsp;and read a book he will find therein. Descent and escape should then be easier - do not use the front door.
 <i>(Gordo Greatbelly in Sinclair User issue 39)</i> 

<br><hr>
Dolsig of I know not where and Stanley of Bromsgrove wandered by. I heard them groaning over Valkyrie 17 and leapt to their aid. Having killed the evil Reichsmuller, Dolsig had no clue about his next steps. A taxi he must find. To take him&nbsp;where? Ah, he should have looked through a seafront telescope forward and back. A destination should become visible once that is done.
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stanley could find no cash to pay his hotel bill - I know the type. Pawn some valuables in the town but&nbsp;remember you cannot go by cablecar. Skis are the thing. See amid the winter's snow ...

At another fire Boyd the Bold boasted of his total success with Valkyrie 17. He has also found that repeatedly opening and closing the safe will deliver an endless supply of necklaces and lethal boxes - but they are of no use! This meant little to Chris of Taggart whose problem was to find a use for a can of spray foam. It is not for whiskers, young sir, but can blind any spying eye, even if made of glass or metal.
