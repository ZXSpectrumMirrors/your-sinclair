&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next item on the agenda, <I>Ghost
Town</I>, is a slight departure from Scott's
usual style in that it contains a bonus scoring system. This routine awards extra
points if you complete the puzzles in the
correct order. It is still possible to finish the
adventure if the order is wrong but those of
you who enjoy going over things again will
have fun sorting this out. I don't know the
correct sequence, so, if any of you do - let
me know.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The game starts you off in a&nbsp;deserted
Ghost Town and once more treasures must
be found and stored.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again you might like to begin by
having a drink to fortify your spirits, but
you just might bump into one once you
make your presence known. If you're armed, don't shoot the piano player ... Show
a little appreciation even if he plays a few
bum notes; you probably can't do any better - or can you? Too much vanity could
be fatal though - it's up to you to get this
one taped.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the stable, your horse, 'ole paint, is
waiting for you but he's not quite road-
worthy yet, as you'll discover if you see the
point. This one has an attractive answer
although you'll probably end up in something far less wholesome. Still, down
doesn't necessarily mean out - it might be
better to look in.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The telegraph office is a more solid problem - a safe that can't be opened and a
key that won't work. You must be moved
to greater things and a little electrical know-
how will give a clue, albeit in a sort of
code! The answer should be very clear
to us Brits.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hoosegow should be open to you
now, unless your thinking and mine are
poles apart. Another item or two should be
added to your collection, plus a good clue
to give you a monopoly (?).
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walk on! Giddyup! Heigh Ho Silver! -
in true cowboy style you can gallop across
the plains - a short ride should put you in
with the indians though - don't panic -
you can drum up some support - if you
know.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dry wash? That seems a little odd but
the merest flash of inspiration is all that's
needed to help you jump ahead. So have a
go!
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mine of information? - not really,
but necessary to visit none the less and easy
if you've picked up the clue.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point you might think of the odd
substances you've found. I used to be a
chemist, so it was pretty easy for me but it's
a safe bet that if I can't help you, Guy
Fawkes could!
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put plenty of distance between you and
the result of your experiment though -
or it'll be raining more than cats and dogs
today!
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you're clever you should be able to
find somewhere safe to sleep without my
help but don't go to bed too early. After
all,&nbsp;you've earned a little relaxation by
now, so go and enjoy yourself - the
rewards might be more than spiritual.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That should be about all you need to get
you by, except to say that the last place a
cowboy wants to go is to Boot Hill, but, if
you've done everything else, what have you
got to lose?<br>
