<TR><TD>Many people appear to be having difficulty in getting further than level 3 in
Lunar Jetman. This letter should help solve that problem, giving you a
technique to amass well over 50,000 points and get past the teleport-stealing
aliens on level 6.
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, bear in mind that you don't need to transport the bomb to the
alien base, but you can instead shoot the missile by hitting it 8 + (level you
are on) times. The problem is to gain enough time to shoot the missile down
before it reaches your truck. Flying to intercept it doesn't work because you
run out of fuel. The solution is therefore as follows:
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fill in all the holes between the two teleport booths (you might as well pick
up the light gun turret while&nbsp;you are doing so) and then head for the teleport
furthest away from the alien base. While you are in the moon rover you can use
thrust and fire to raise/lower the gun and fire at the aliens. Once you have
positioned yourself beside the appropriate booth you can blast away at the
aliens until the missile is fired and the warning appears. Then get out of the
truck and enter the teleport, thus giving at the other booth (which brings you
closer to the approaching missile). Don't&nbsp;fly about, wasting fuel, but remain
in front of the booth until you see the rocket appear. (If before then, a rock
or an alien is heading towards you, you can teleport to the other booth and
wait until you think the danger is past then teleport back - don't wait too
long or you may miss the missile!)
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as you see the missile, start shooting at it, and by the time you get
back to the moon rover you should have blown it up. If all else fails, jump on
it (this stops it dead - and you too). All you have to do then, is keep
repeating the process. When you reach level 6 the aliens have the ability to
teleport and steal the booths. The system I use is to place the teleport on the
moon rover where the aliens will leave it alone, and then drive it around so
you still have one teleport between you and the base. As before, when the
missile is launched, you teleport to the other booth, move to one side and
shoot into the booth, thus destroying any aliens who try to teleport. Try
avoiding enemies by moving rather than the teleport method. When the rocket
appears, shoot it down as before. Using this technique I have reached level 8
(rocket-firing aliens) several times, but I'm sure your readers will soon beat
this.

<TR><TD><I>Lunar Jetman</I> -
for infinite lives, do POKE
36966,224 and POKE
36945,3;
 <i>(Dave Nicholls in Your Spectrum issue 09)</i> 

<br><hr>
[these are wrong; see correction by Pete Shaw in issue 11's &quot;From the Hip&quot;]
 <i>(Dave Nicholls in Your Spectrum issue 09)</i> 

<br><hr>
POKE 36965,0 for a similar
effect [endless lives] on <I>Lunar Jetman</I>,
though he says it's not much
help to him anyway!
 <i>(Andrew Dawson in Your Spectrum issue 11)</i> 

<br><hr>
I had a few calls from readers
who'd tried Dave Nicholls' infinite
lives POKEs for <I>Lunar Jetman</I>
as given in issue 9 -
apparently they were wrong!
The POKEs should have been
POKE 36964,224 and POKE 36965,3.
 <i>(Peter Shaw in Your Spectrum issue 11)</i> 

<br><hr>
	Now here's a funny
thing. <B>Kieron Matthews</B>
has found that a POKE we
printed way back in <A href="http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~jimg/yr09/yr09_03.htm#Hacking">Issue 9</A>
for <I>Sabre Wulf</I> has a rather
peculiar effect on <I>Lunar Jetman</I>. It prevents the
missile from launching and
ruining your chances. Then,
to reach the next level you
should wait for the time to
run out and shoot at the
base. Trouble is Kieron just
can't get past level 10 even
with the POKE, 'cos he can't
find the trailer anywhere.
Mind you, there's a good
reason for that - the trailer
just doesn't exist! It may be
on the inlay card but it's
certainly not in the game.
To get any further you'll just
have to do a Robert the
Bruce - try and try again!
