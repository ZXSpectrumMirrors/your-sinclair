<TR><TD>Sooner or later there will be times when you are entombed or imprisoned. Try every object you have with you - throw, drop, use, rub, even eat them. Something might work. In The Final Mission of the Ket Trilogy you begin by being locked up in the evil Vran's murky dungeons. Escape from the first cell is easy but you find yourself trapped in yet another. If you drop one of your very few possessions the door will open to the vast halls of the enchanter's fortress.

<B>Dateline:	19th September, 1984.</B><BR>
THE DAY has arrived. After successfully solving all of the problems in
<I>Mountains of Ket</I> and <I>Temple of Vran</I>
the pre-paid copy of the third part of the
<I>Ket Trilogy</I> is due today.&nbsp;Where is
that postman? Computer, TV and tape-
recorder are at the ready. A day off
from work has been arranged (Or
perhaps it's your grannie's funeral
again!) as preparations are made to win
the video recorder and title of <B>Britain's
Best Adventurer</B>. Check letter-box
again. Nothing! Re-check calendar. Yes,
today is the 19th. Click, rattle. Dash to
front door. Small parcel on the floor.
Rip open and off we go!<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Insert cassette and press REWIND!
Calm down. Press PLAY. Nice title
screen. Read insert and competition
entry details. CRASH! Blank screen!
Rewind and LOAD again. Come on,
POWER 48 is supposed to load quicker!
BEEP! BEEP! At last ...<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, faced with a variation of
a LOCKED DOOR and no key! But
HELP is at hand - the insert made
mention of STAND ON CHAIR. Try
that! OK, now can see solution to
problem. NOT AGAIN! Another room
with no apparent exit. Eventually the
light shines and you're off again. Calm,
confident now - proceed carefully
(thinks - not many other adventurers
will have found that DAGGER!). On-
screen SCORE shows 11% - not bad
and not had to re-start yet.<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly another dead-end.
TRAPDOOR which will not open.
Retreat. Explore PILLARED HALL,
find GARLIC, SOAP and a
CROWBAR - hurry to TRAPDOOR
- but was OOFED by a MAGIC BOOT
on the way!  Manage to open
TRAPDOOR but break CROWBAR in
the process. Will that matter? Press on
for now.<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's this? <I>Another</I> locked DOOR!
Retreat again. Eventually find key -
rush back to DOOR but there is no
KEYHOLE!<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retreat and explore again. Find
DELPHIA'S BODY in the morgue, an
AEROSOL and a green slime
MONSTER. Caught by the MONSTER
- DEAD - PUSH KEY FOR
ANOTHER GAME.<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OK, off we go again. OOFED again
- must be a way of avoiding that (there
is, read symbols and reverse the &quot;en&quot;
monster!). Cleaned up the green slime
this time and used AEROSOL to reduce
the LOCKED DOOR problem only to
be&nbsp;faced with ANOTHER locked
DOOR. Key works this time. Fight
MONK and into large CHAMBER.
SCORE now 38%. Press on, explore
CHAMBER, dodging arrows. Find five
GATES, each with a GUARDIAN who
poses a question. SCORE now 51%!
Suddenly realise further progress only
possible by answering questions
correctly! DEAD STOP! After two and
a half programmes of traditional
adventure, Incentive have obviously
decided enough is enough - after all
&#163;400 is at stake and it shouldn't be too
easy. To illustrate this, the first GATE is
blocked by the GUARDIAN OF
WISDOM who asks you to complete the
sequence &quot;2, 2, 2, 3, 2, ...&quot;. The first
obvious thought of 22, 23, 24, 25
produces a &quot;you are ignored&quot; response
to your entry of 425 so try again! Looks
as though it could be a telephone
number. Directory Enquiries - No,
Incentive's number is not 22232 ... !!
VAT number? Registered Company
Number? No! No! Is it a phone
number? The dialling code for Westminster is 222 - could it be the House
of Commons? - perhaps not, if
WISDOM is any kind of a clue!<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You soon realise that the title of
Britain's Best Adventurer will not be
easily gained. After all, with a new video
recorder you could be tempted away
from your computer!

<br><hr>
Trekker Topharn of Huddersfield pressed me for aid. She had encountered a slime thing in the halls of Vran and fought long and uselessly. She should ignore this demon - it serves nothing to stay. But that was not enough for Trekker. What of the cubby hole near the High Ceilinged room? What use for the garlic?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Borrowing her haunch of lamb I told her that the cubby hole is useful as a hiding place. If any of you should encounter a 'splatting' noise in the High room than head west and up to the hole. Wait here six times and you should hear a splintering. You may then find a closed door open. The garlic ... well, all travellers know that to be a specific against the bloodsuckers and flesheaters. The Lady Delphia has just such noisome eating habits. Garlic in a place of death will stave off her attacks.
