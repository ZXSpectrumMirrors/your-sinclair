<TR><TD>The other main routine is designed to let you play on any of the 20 sheets you
want and involves pressing ENTER as usual when the loading is completed and the
music is playing, but then key in the number 6031769. A boot appears where the
lives normally are displayed. The levels can then be selected by pressing
between one and five simultaneously. These have been reported in letters quite
variously, but the common denominator is the figure 6. When the sheet you want
appears on screen, release the keys and start playing. These are the keys which
must be pressed simultaneously:

<TR><TD>	To finish up, let's take
a look at the one that
started it all off - <I>Manic Miner</I>. Although it's
getting on a bit now,
there's still a few people
out there who don't
know the 'easy' way of
moving about the rooms.
On the original Bug-Byte version, you have
to type in the sequence
of numbers '6031769'
(reputed to be Matthew
Smith's old phone
number) and, while
holding down the '6' key
press combinations of
keys '1' to '5' to move
around. When Matthew
moved to Software
Projects, however, he
changed the code to
'TYPEWRITER' -
hence the code word for
JSW. Again, once
you've typed the code in,
you hold down the '6'
key and press
combinations of keys '1'
to '6'. All this comes
from <B>A Wiseman</B>, along
with&nbspthe original 'infinite
lives' POKE (for the
Bug-Byte version <I>only</I>)
- namely, POKE
35136,0. <BR>

<TR><TD>	You may remember that
some months ago I gave the
infinite lives for Bug-Byte's
version of <I>Manic Miner</I>. So
that those of you with the
Software Project's version
don't feel left out, <B>A J Bull</B> has
sent in POKE 35142,0 which
does the same.

If you're
always gasping for air,
then young <B>Yan</B> has come
to the rescue with his life
saving POKES for infinite
air in both versions of the
game. You can get the
Bug-Byte air supply with:<BR>

<BR><BR><B>The "No Collision" POKE is a bit dodgy. Not only does some of the screen
flash if you do hit a nasty, but if you fall from a&nbsp;distance, you end up stuck

<BR>If you do get stuck, use the "Disable" number listed next to the POKE, and you
will die as normal. Then you can re-activate the POKE again if needed.

[The] first routine is to secure a large or unlimited number of lives. One method says, stop the tape after the picture has loaded, BREAK in, LIST and type: 25 POKE 35136,0. Then ENTER, type in RUN and ENTER that, and start the tape again. A better method is to type in before starting the LOAD: MERGE "", press ENTER and start tape. When the OK sign appears at the bottom of the screen, stop the tape immediately. LIST and type in: 25 POKE 35136,0 and then ENTER it. Both routines create unlimited lives.
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A similar routine for a larger but limited number of lives is this: Load for a
few seconds until the screen turns black, then stop the tape, type in INK 7 and
press ENTER twice and a listing should appear. Type in: 25 POKE 34269,n (where
n=the number of lives you want) and then ENTER. Too many lives slows the game
down.

<TR><TD>Manic Miner can be one of the most frustrating games when you make stupid mistakes, so I have written a method of POKEing in a number to allow you to 'die' without losing any 'men'.
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First break the program after loading the basic loader -&nbsp;when the screen turns black - and then type-in 'PAPER 7' followed by 35 POKE 35136,0; and RUN; then re-start the tape.

<br><hr>
WE ARE WRITING as we believe readers will be interested in two programs which, when typed in, will either give you 32 lives or let you use a practice mode on Manic Miner.
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 32 lives, first of all type Merge "". Start tape. Stop the tape&nbsp;after merging the first part of the program. List. Type in line 25 POKE 34269,32. Run. Start tape.
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For practice mode and everlasting lives, type Merge "". Start tape. Stop tape after merging the first part of the program. List. Type in line 25 POKE 35136,0. Run. Load the rest of the program. Press enter. Then type 6031769. A boot will appear by the lives at the bottom. Press all the keys shown at the same time to change stage.
