<TR><TD>	Now for the joystick mod.
Having reset the Speccy, enter
the listing given and save it on
tape with LINE 1000 (don't
save it to Microdrive or you'll
get into all sorts of problems).
Then load <I>Chuckie Egg</I> in the
way described above and do
the POKE on its own if you
want it. Next, load the joystick
mod and, hey presto - a
joystick <I>Chuckie Egg</I>! As
before, if any error occurs
during the loading of the
second listing, the machine will
fall over and you'll have to start
from scratch.<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	I also got a letter from
someone who wishes to be
known as '<B>ITR</B>', who said that
they knew the infinite lives
POKE for <I>Chuckie Egg</I> but
wouldn't condescend to tell me
what it was - we don't need
your type round here!
Actually, ITR did come up
with some interesting stuff on
the way the screens are stored.
Apparently they're stored from
46000 to 51372, each taking
672 bytes. The letter went on
to supply a neat little program
that fills in all the holes at the
bottom of the screens:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<H4>500 FOR f=46000 TO 51372 STEP 672<BR>
51O FOR g=0 TO 31<BR>
520 POKE f+g,5<BR>
53O NEXT g<BR>
540 NEXT f<BR>
560 RANDOMIZE USR 42000</H4><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enter this in the same way as
the joystick patch, by saving it
to tape. In fact, I think these
POKEs are better than infinite
lives; the game still remains
difficult, though easier than the
standard version.<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<CODE>1000 DATA 39277, 103, 39321, 71, 40311, 71, 40893, 71, 39341, 79, 40254, 79, 40850, 79, 40655, 95, 40713, 40713, 87<BR>
1010 RESTORE 1000<BR>
1020 FOR i=1 TO 9: READ a,b<BR>
1030 POKE a,219: POKE a+1,223: POKE a+2,0: POKE a+3,0: POKE a+4,203: POKE a+5,b<BR>
1040 NEXT i<BR>
1100 RANDOMIZE USR 42000</CODE>
<H4>The Basic listing providing a joystick mode for <I>Chuckie Egg</I>.</H4>
<FONT COLOR=red><B>... including the mandatory mistake, of course. The DATA statement has 19 values but the FOR...NEXT only reads 18, probably because the 40713 near the end has been entered twice.</B></FONT>

<TR><TD>	As promised last month,
here's a bit of info about
<I>Chuckie Egg</I> which (by the
way) is probably the best game
A'n'F has ever produced. It's
quite old now and doesn't work
with the Kempston joystick.
Other joysticks (for example,
Interface 2) are OK as it uses
definable keys; it can, however,
be suitably modified. But
before that, let's reveal the
most important POKE ... for
infinite lives. When I originally
hacked <I>Chuckie Egg</I> (actually
before it was released) I didn't
even look for infinite lives -
which goes to show how long
ago it must have been! Luckily
I kept my notes and recently
had another go at it, with the
help of a letter from <B>Graham Hutton</B>.<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	The first thing to do is to
load the bytes, which is not
very straightforward because of
the protection method it uses. I
don't want to step on anyone's
toes, so I'm not going to supply
a special loader; I'll use instead
a modified version of the
loader in the game. To begin
with, enter the multiple line (do
a NEW first if you have
Interface 1 attached):<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<H4>MERGE &quot;&quot;: POKE 24501,195: GO TO 1</H4><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then play the tape. It'll load as
normal, but will return to Basic
when finished. At this stage, if
any error occurs, the machine
will fall over - so be careful
what you type. For infinite lives
enter:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<H4>POKE 42837,0: RANDOMIZE USR
42000</H4><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the game should start. It's
not the most efficient way of
doing the job, but it does work.
Instead of removing a
DEC(HL) or DEC(IX+n), it
changes a jump instruction,
and this has the effect of
printing the 'Game Over'
message a couple of times
during the game ... but don't let
that put you off.<BR><br>

<br><hr>
	One thing Alan was
wondering about was
how to hack into A&amp;F's
<I>Chuckie Egg</I> - a tricky
one this, mainly because
you can't MERGE it
and it's headerless to
boot. Well, I hacked into
it a while ago to make it
work with my joystick
and it's not too hard.
The trick is to LOAD
the Basic from machine
code, then instead of
doing a RET, force an
error using RST 8. That
should be enough for
you to be getting on with
for now. <BR>
