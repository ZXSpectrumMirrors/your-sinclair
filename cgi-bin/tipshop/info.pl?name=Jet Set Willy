<TR><TD>I though I'd write to you and
point out some interesting
things you seem to have missed
in your <A href="http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~jimg/yr06/yr06_21.htm">articles</A> on <I>Jet Set Willy</I>. <BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Firstly, it was suggested that
you need to get the invisible
object in the First Landing.
You don't. The invisible object
which is actually lodged in the
wall, is almost certainly another
bug in the program. I've heard
that you can reach it by
jumping off the 39th step of&nbsp;the
ladder (could this be a tie-in
with the famous book <I>The 39 Steps</I>?) but I've not managed
to get the blasted thing yet!
Perhaps someone out there has
managed it? <BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	You're right in thinking that
the room called Nomen Luni is
a&nbsp;take-off of Imagine's <I>Zzoom</I>
game - in Latin, <I>Nomen Lundi</I> can be roughly
translated as 'The name of the
Game', Imagine's old
catchline. But there's more to
this than meets the eye. If you
look at the central graphics
blocks in&nbsp;this room, you
wouldn't be blamed for
thinking they gave the
impression of the tail end of an
aircraft. Now look at the room
below (Under The Roof) -
can you make out what could
be the front end of the plane?
Hey presto ... the joke is that a
plane, probably from
Imagine's <I>Zzoom</I>, has crashed
into the top of of Willy's mansion. <BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	I do admit to being one of
those poor souls who, having
read the <I>Jet Set Loony</I> letter
in issue 7's Forum, waited six
hours for the raft to appear.
Well, I thought it was a joke at
the time, but you can never be
too sure. You also made a bit
of a mess of your
WRITETYPER chart by
saying that Nomen Luni, The
Wine Cellar, The Watch Tower
and The Tool Shed can be
reached using this method -
they can't! You're forgiven this
time, but consider your
knuckles rapped.

	Meanwhile if you
enjoyed looking at the
unused sprites in <I>Jet Set Willy</I> using the little
program in <A href="http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~jimg/yr16/yr16_07.htm#Hacking">issue 16</A>,
<B>Christian Keane</B> of
Liverpool suggests you try
some of these numbers
instead of the 512:
300, 350, 10, 170.
 <i>(Christian Keane in Your Spectrum issue 21)</i> 

<br><hr>
Neil Gore and Viv Shadbolt have both discovered the secret 'passages'. Try jumping off the Watchtower or rescuing Esmerelda to find yourself in the off-licence or Ball Room East respectively.

<TR><TD>It's not often that a
software house comes up
with the goods on how to
break in to manipulate
its own commercial
output - but that's
exactly what Software
Projects are doing with
its <I>Jet Set Willy</I> package.
The much-publicised
&quot;sneaky random hazards
feature&quot; which befell
unsuspecting players
entering The Attic seems
to have turned out to be
the bug we all thought it
was, and thanks to Ross
Holman and Cameron
Else (winners of the
<I>JSW</I> champagne and
glasses) the company
now have a number of
'fixes' you can add to
your program. And this
is what you do ... <BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Rewind the <I>Jet Set Willy</I> tape and load it
using MERGE &quot;&quot;, press
Enter and start the tape.
Once the loader program has been loaded
you will get the 'OK'
message on the screen
and you should stop the
tape. Now enter: <BR><BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<CODE><B>CLEAR 32767 <BR>
LOAD &quot;&quot; CODE</B>
</CODE><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as direct commands and
start the tape. After the
main part of the program
has loaded, enter the
following as direct
commands: <BR><BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<CODE><B>POKE 60231,0 <BR>
POKE 42183,11 <BR>
POKE 59901,82 <BR>
POKE 56876,4</B>
</CODE>
<BR><BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and your problems
should be over. To start
the new version of the
game,&enter GO TO 40. <BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Of course, if you don't
want to go through this
process each time,
you can save it on
another tape. So, once
you've sorted out the
leads for a SAVE, enter: <BR><BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<CODE><B>SAVE &quot;JETSET&quot; LINE 10 <BR>
SAVE&nbsp&quot;JSW&quot; CODE 32769,32768</B>
</CODE>

I HAVE managed recently to get my hands on a copy of the long-awaited Jet Set Willy. This game struck me as an example of the very finest games design possible and is a good target for other software houses but I was rather annoyed to find&nbsp;that there are one or two severe bugs in it.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After playing the game for some time I found a room by the name of "Dr Jones will never believe this".<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the time I left the room I found that unusual things began to happen in certain rooms. For a start, all the nasties in the chapel disappeared, the UFO in the bridge disappeared, and if you enter either the kitchen or the east wall base or inside the mega trunk one by one all your lives disappear.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another rather less cataclysmic bug is that when on the rope hanging over the beach, if you swing until the rope is at full swing and then jump off, so that you hit the top of the screen, you suddenly re-appear half way under the sand. Surely this could be corrected?

Jonathan Cheetham discovered a means of gaining access to all rooms. First, guide Willy to the first landing and position him between the stairs and the entrance to 'To the Kitchens'. Then type WRITETYPER. Press key 9 and you should appear&nbsp;in the off-licence. Holding down combinations of keys 1-6 with key 9 should, according to Cheetham, transport you to other rooms. For example, 239 gets you to the entrance to Hades.

I am a follower of that great
language Basic. However, after
reading the <A href="http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~jimg/yr04/yr04_60.htm#JSW2"><I>Hacker's Guide</I></A> in
issue 4, I collected all 83
objects in ... ssshh, you know
what ... with the help of the
map and 18 of my own POKEs
(including two from Software
Projects which make the
Banyan Tree and Conservatory
Roof possible). Some not
published are POKE 35899,0
(immunity to arrows) and those
to get the first landing object -
56347,0; 56350,0; 56357,170;
and 56358,170. For a larf, try
POKE 36901,85 or POKE
37805,60. Tee-hee! <BR>
 <i>(David Fox in Your Spectrum issue 08)</i> 

<br><hr>
	Yet more POKEs have come
in for <I>JSW</I> - there can't be
many left now, surely! Anyway,
here goes: <B>A Wiseman</B> sent in
POKE 37874,0 which makes
you collect any object as soon
as you enter each room, and
POKE 36353,60 which
improves your jumping abilities. <B>M Firby</B> sent in POKE
36353,44 which makes it much
easier to get the object in The
Nightmare Room, and <B>Andy W</B> (what's with the anonymity
Andy?) reveals that POKE
38207,24 removes the dreaded
Maria (though you can still see
the final effect). <BR>
 <i>(A Wiseman, M Firby, Andy W in Your Spectrum issue 09)</i> 

<br><hr>
	Like everyone else, I've had
it up to here with <I>Jet Set Willy</I>.
But it's U-turn time, and all
because of a letter from <B>Mike Smith</B>. To get the mysterious
object in the First Landing, he
supplied probably the best
<I>JSW</I> POKEs I've seen in a
long time, namely POKE
56350,0: POKE 56358,0:
POKE 56365,85. What these
fiendishly simple POKEs do is
add a platform so that you can
go to the cross and get the
object. Now, where was I? Oh
yes, I've had it up to here with
<I>JSW</I> POKEs.
 <i>(Mike Smith in Your Spectrum issue 12)</i> 

<br><hr>
Try: FOR f=44800
TO 44928 : POKE
f,PEEK(f+512) : NEXT f. Now
one of Matthew Smith's
unused sprites is revealed
- you'll see the penknife
change into a moving top-hat. To see another one
alter the 512 to 640, run it
again and you'll get a
rotating periscope.
 <i>(Mark Sanderson in Your Spectrum issue 16)</i> 

<br><hr>
Load
the first program, stop the
tape and reset the
machine. Next, MERGE the
second program, and
insert POKE VAL &quot;26744&quot;,
NOT PI to stop the alien
ships firing bombs, or
POKE VAL &quot;24373&quot;, NOT
PI for a very different
effect! (Exactly <I>what</I> is a
mystery!)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;POKE 38240,0 - removes all moving objects; POKE 36477,1 - stops death when falling; POKE 37982,0 -&nbsp;allows you to walk through nasties; POKE 35899,0 - infinite lives; POKE 35123,0 - disable any moving object; POKE 38207,0 - disable Maria; POKE 36545,0 banyan tree easier; POKE 36358,0 - extra zip when jumping.

I RECENTLY bought Jet Set Willy produced by Software Projects. It is an excellent game and I have found a way of poking in a code so that it is possible to have infinite lives. It has proved very useful and has enabled me to discover all the rooms and find the items without making the game boring. To obtain it you have to type in before loading:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>35 POKE 35899,0 (return)<br>
MERGE "" (return)<br>
Load until 'OK' statement<br>
Stop tape<br>
RUN<br>
Start tape<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the game has loaded you will find that when you are killed you will lose no lives. A word of warning - never fall into a room. If you do and find that you die continuously, press Caps Shift and Break and you will have to start all over again.
 <i>(David Gibson in Sinclair User issue 28)</i> 

<br><hr>
OUR THANKS to all who have sent letters revealing hints and tips for Jet Set Willy from Software Projects. First, infinite lives. To obtain immortality, load the program with MERGE "", stop the tape, and ENTER: 37 POKE 35899,0. Then ENTER:&nbsp;GOTO 10 and re-start the tape.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pagett also tells of a way of disabling the sprite graphics to render the mansion virtually trouble-free. Using the preceding method, add the line: 35 FOR F=40000 TO 40191: POKE F,0:NEXT F: FOR F=43780 TO 46595: POKE F,0:NEXT F:FOR F=46845 TO 49178:POKE F,0:NEXT F.
 <i>(L Griffiths, Ian Rogers, David Pagett in Sinclair User issue 29)</i> 

<br><hr>
Finally, the last word should go to Software Projects. Now that the game has been won - see news story - the company has revealed a means of bypassing the so-called bug which involved instant death in several locations after visiting the Attic.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not a bug at all but a deliberate attempt to make the game even more difficult in the later stages. To negate the feature, load the first part of the program with MERGE "". Then ENTER: CLEAR 32767 and LOAD "" CODE. Start the tape. When the main program has loaded, ENTER: POKE 60231,0 POKE 42183,11 POKE 59901,82 and POKE 56876,4. To play the new version, ENTER: GOTO 40. To save the new version, ENTER: SAVE "JETSET" LINE 10 and SAVE "JSW" CODE 32768,32768.
 <i>(Software Projects in Sinclair User issue 29)</i> 

<br><hr>
And if there are still Jet Set Willy fanatics out there I have some useful pokes. For any of the pokes type in CLEAR 30000: LOAD "" CODE: (put all pokes here separated by colons) : RANDOMISE USR 33792 (ENTER). Start your tape player.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pokes are: POKE 36353,44 - allows you to be sucked up a left hand wall; POKE 35899,0 - infinite lives; POKE 34795,x - type x as the number of the starting room, 0 to 60; POKE 36477,1 - stops you dying when you fall from a height; POKE 59900,255 - an anti-attic poke; POKE 41983,255 - get the tap from the bathroom, jump on your bed and see what happens; POKE 34275,10 - access to any room by pressing nine and another number key; POKE 36358,0 - jump higher than normal; POKE 35123,0 - deletes all baddies which move and removes ropes.
