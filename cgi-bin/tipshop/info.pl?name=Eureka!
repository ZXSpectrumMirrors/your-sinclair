<TR><TD>There were more tales from Orcslayer Fletcher of Gloucester, who had much advice on Eureka within whose time zones he had journed long. In the Roman time he obtained the swamprose by going to the south gate. From there south, east, southwest, east and south again. The travellers, slightly foxed by now, were more amazed by the means to gain the Arthurian magic ring. Mentioning a minstrel, Elvis by name, he told us to play the harp and then, when asked for a tune, to strum out&nbsp;Jailhouse Rock, whatever that may be!

	The action begins in a cornfield (no,
not <I>that</I> sort of action!) and from here
you'll need to go south-east to find the
RAF officer's uniform. When you get
caught by the Germans in the village
(which is inevitable) you get hauled off to
Colditz and stuck in the cooler. Once
out, finding your way around the camp
isn't too difficult and there are only a few
locations where the guards get nasty and
throw you back in again.
<BR>
	To make a German officer's uniform
you'll need the sewing kit, and that you'll
find under the stage. To get an ID card
you'll have to go through the secret passage in the chapel - there you'll find the
blank card, plus rubber stamp and camera. To make the ID look genuine, you'll
need to take a picture of yourself,
develop the film, stamp the card - and
then bring the pieces together with the
MAKE command.<BR>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	The rope, made from the traditional
blankets, can be used to scale the drop
below the window at the end of the dormitory, underneath which you'll find a
pickaxe and crowbar.
 <i>(Peter Shaw in Your Spectrum issue 10)</i> 

<br><hr>
In order to get your
mitts on the bronze helmet
release the hare from the trap,
go to the cavern on the beach
and 'CLIMB INTO POOL',
go East then North, 'CLIMB
OUT OF POOL' and then
retrace your steps. Once
you've got the helmet you can
cross the causeway. You can
then get the sword by going
North, East and North to the
lake and SLEEP. You'll need
this to kill the bear. <BR>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Finally John reckons the
Pig, Clay Pot, Silver Skull and
Vase are red herrings - does
anybody out there know
better?##
He says you must
pick up the flint and the rib
bone and use these to make an
axe. Then go West from the
river and you can use it.

The
Brachiosaurus will step on you
if you make the slightest move,
so just STAY STILL (and this
must be done twice) - not
quite as stylish as the WAIT
command to which we have
become accustomed, but it will
do the trick.
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another monster, &nbsp;the
Tyrannosaurus Rex, is just
after your blood, and will
follow your every move. There
is no direct way to deal with
this slavering beast - the best
thing to do is to attempt to lure
the thing to the pit. If you can
JUMP the Pit, then you&nbsp;will
find that the T Rex will fall in.
 <i>(Tony Bridge, Ken Matthews in Micro Adventurer issue 15)</i> 

<br><hr>
In pre-historic times you need to say
Kong Ka to the man with the
spear to be led to the village.
Here you must trade for the
bamboo ladder and the clay
pot you need to survive the
desert.
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	In Roman times your first
task should be to get the key
from the dark, narrow alley
before allowing yourself to be
captured as a galley slave. Use
key to escape from your chains
then wait until the boat is sunk
- don't try to move it. When
you are adrift save the man
and you will both be&nbsp;rescued.
You should have managed to
learn Latin by now as well!

Rambo the Rover of Slough has a fair knowlege of Eureka. He requests payment for his answers so you should contact him to negotiate terms. Rambo provided the answer to Orcslayer's plea for help in blowing up the bridge safely. First type D, then attach the dynamite, then type V,S and use the dynamite.
