<TR><TD>Remember the <I>Fairlight</I>
review last month? You
may have noticed that
<B>Dave Nicholls</B> did not give
any POKEs for the game.
To spare his blushes,
cracking <I>Fairlight</I> is not a
trivial task. The actual
protection isn't that hard
but the tactic is to wear you
out long before you make it
- there's a total of 140
stages of decryption from
you hitting LOAD to the
game starting! <BR>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	First it decrypts itself 20
times just to turbo-load the
second turbo-loader which
then decrypts itself before
loading the actual game.
As the routines are
cumulative, It should be
impossible to pop in any
POKEs as the game loads.
Enter <B>ZZKJ</B> (whose full
name is so long we had to
leave It out last month
even though&nbsp;he supplied
the <I>Gyron</I> stuff) and the
impossible is a short
program away. Run ZZ's
program and you'll get
infinite lives, the ability to
carry as much as you like,
five barrels and the ability
to open any previously
locked doors! <BR>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	If you don't want all of
these options then just
miss out the relevant DATA
lines, being careful not to
omit line 400. When you
run it, you will not see the
<I>Fairlight</I> loading screen
although its attributes will
load and the program will
run as normal.

This hack gives you all the usual goodies to help you complete the game, but
only works with the updated version of Fairlight (the one with the Kempston
joystick interface option).

<TR><TD>Take the Book of Light,
two small stoppered bottles,
and the cross hidden under
the throne, to the room with
the monk standing at the
top of the stairs. Drop the
cross in front of him and
push it at him - he'll
disappear. Do the same with
the next two monks this
time with the stoppered
bottles. At the top of the
stairs pile up a barrel and a
chair, and using the Book of
Light, jump into the room
above. Here you'll find the
key to the castle gate. If you
drop the Book, the figure
here changes into a monk,
but this seems to be a good
thing, as I've only been able
to get back out with him in
this state.
 <i>(Keith Gronneberg in Your Sinclair issue 1, Your Sinclair issue 2)</i> 

<br><hr>
The items required to complete
the game are the Scroll, one Cross,
two Potions, the Crown, the Book
and two Keys. The Wizard is
entrapped in the Tower which
you're looking out of on the loading
screen. To free him you need to
collect the scroll and the crown
from the courtyard. When playing
the game, it's always best
to dispose of all guards, by killing
them then dropping them near a
whirlwind until it takes them away.
The trolls are best covered by a
barrel after killing them by placing
a barrel over the spot you killed
them. This prevents them from
reappearing.
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After collecting the hourglass
cross the drawbridge, using the
hourglass, and pass the troll.
Follow the walls, and you will find a
door hidden in one of the walls. Put
the crown on view, and you'll be
able to open the door. Inside the
tomb, push the body to one side
and push one of the slabs oft.
Dropping down into the next tomb,
collect the book, go through the
door to appear beside the cliff edge
outside. Use the scroll to get back
to the courtyard, and head for the
room with the cross. Collect the
cross and potion, and kill the guard
in the room of the deadly flowers.
The key you will find is the key to
the Keep. You&nbsp;can jump past the
first monk, but you'll need to throw
potion at the next one and the
cross at the last one. Kill one guard
and climb the final stairs. Use the
barrel from the ground floor,
jumping on it to get you up into the
last room. Give the Book to the
wizard, making sure you collect the
key first, and he'll change into a
monk. When the monk pushes you
out, you may now leave the castle,
provided you've the crown, and the
key for the courtyard gate. That's it!
Finished!
