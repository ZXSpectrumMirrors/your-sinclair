	The first of these trickier quests, <I>Strange
Odyssey</I>, has a science fiction setting. You
start in a scoutship crashed on a planetoid.
Obviously, nothing works and you
must explore this dismal chunk of rock to
gather the items to aid your escape. You are
better equipped than in most of Scott's
adventures as the hold contains several items
essential for your survival. It also poses a
problem - the access hatch to the engine
you need to repair has jammed in the
impact. Nothing you own will shift it -
you'll have to go outside.
<BR>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting out will be no problem to even
novice space cadets and, if you take a
chance, you'll soon be safely down on the
surface. Lost your bearings? Don't worry,
the planetoid&nbsp;is very small - you're probably just going round in circles. Once you've
got that sorted out and can't find anywhere
else to go - get set and shift that blasted
boulder somehow!
<BR>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last! A place with a bit of atmosphere
and plenty to&nbsp;play with. You'd best learn
how to manipulate things - one false move
could prove fatal. After some pulling and
pushing you should be glowing with pride
but a gentle touch is needed before you'll
get anywhere new!
<BR>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You'll now have discovered several locations and I'll leave it to you as to which
order you tackle them in, but don't panic -
here are a few general tips to help you along.
<BR>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You might start on nice soft ground near
a jungle of rather wicked looking trees&nbsp;so be
careful if you venture in.
<BR>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Found a deserted zoo? The Ice-Hound
looks pretty lean and hungry, so, if you're
going to do anything with him, tranquilize
him first.
<BR>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How kind, putting him where be belongs
- if you potter about&nbsphe might lead you
somewhere (double oriental?). If you are
puzzled by a mound, go in or forget it -
take your pick! You could get in a tight spot
but you can always shoot your way out if
you've been careful.
<BR>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looting a museum could be&nbsp;profitable
and careful examination of all items always
pays dividends. If the painting makes your
eyes swim, find some sunglasses or similar!
<BR>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A twist in the plot can ease the gravity of
the situation and get you a couple more useful items.
<BR>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you've run short of air you can
replenish it from a machine you'll find. All
I'll say is that you need to push more than
one button - make sure you push the right
one first!
<BR>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt you'll soon have all your booty
back in the ship but still won't be able to
take off. A seemingly useless item might
help you find the problem though. A final
tricky twist by Scott? - just so! Perhaps
thinking back to manipulating the rod will
help with this one too. The final part is
quite straightforward or upward so I'll leave
you to sort everything out and complete the
adventure.
