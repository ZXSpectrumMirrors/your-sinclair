<TR><TD>I've been getting letters about
Pyjamarama lately, like my mate Fergus
Clerkin of Co. Monaghan, "It was a
cold day in November when I went to
the newsagents to get Your
Spectrum..." Hey, Fergus, it's Your
Sinclair now! Please go on. "Later&nbsp;on
that night I sat staring angrily at a pair
of scissors that I could not get, your
magazine ripped to shreds beside me.
I'd like to shake James Fitzpatrick
warmly by the throat! How do you get
the scissors?" I also heard from my
favourite game-playing grandmother from
Inverness-shire (Ptui! That's hard to say!)
Mrs B Cameron. "As a complete
beginner to the Speccy (and a Gran) I
am hooked on games. I see James
Fitzpatrick has given me a few tips on
Pyjamarama. But help help&nbsp;help! I can't
pick up the scissors or get into that
'blasted' rocket. I can get the hammer
to the extinguisher to get to 'hell' (?)
only to be wiped out by a fireball!
Sometimes I pick up the laser gun and
fill it with the power pack but by then
I'm dying. My highest score is 64%" Not
bad Mrs C, but hey! Don't trouble yourself
about the scissors, they're not important
to finish the game. If you've got the power
pack your gun is full, so drop the power
pack where you found it. Now go through
the hole in the floor. Go to the rocket
room with a full gun and full petrol can.
Once you're on the moon the aliens will
allow you to get to the door because of
your gun. I won't spoil the last bit for you
but I will tell you that you have to jump at
the magnetic lock. I hope that furnishes
you with happy pyjamas! Zing!<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>LOADER OLD RUBBISH</b><br>
Just a quick erratum... oooooooh,
that's better. You know how I kept
saying that you didn't need the
scissors to complete Pyjamarama?
Just shows how wrong you can be.
Okay, how wrong I can be. Well, I
recently discovered an ancient text,
which refutes, nay contradicts this
information. What you do,
apparently, is go to the lifts and then
go to&nbsp;the room with the Ghosts. Pick
up the Driver's Licence, defenestrate
yourself at the top (it's okay, it only
means go through the window) and
collect the ignition keys. Now off to
the room with the crash helmet, nip
up to the top of the stairs and slide
down the bannisters. Make sure you
now have the crash helmet. Go to
the library and you can pick up the
scissors! Dadah.
 <i>(Hex Loader, Jamie Pitzpatrick in Your Sinclair issue 4, Your Sinclair issue 6)</i> 

<br><hr>
	<B>Colin Read</B> from St. Helens
has finished <I>Pyjamarama</I> and
offers the following clue for his
fellow Wally-followers - crash
helmets are very tough for
library books and if you get
through all the levels in the
games room then you'll get an
extra life.
 <i>(Colin Read in Your Spectrum issue 17)</i> 

<br><hr>
always
get the &#163;1 coin and change it
for the penny (those &#163;1s burn
a hole in your pocket anyway).
You can then get into the
bathroom and grab the
hammer as well as the scissors
which will help you cut the
balloon and get the Box Key
- provided the help-on switch
is down.

<TR><TD>First
off the mark is <B>Adrian Askins</B>
with infinite lives on
<I>Pyjamarama</I>. [see <A href="http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~jimg/yr18/yr18_05.htm#Hacking">issue 18</A>] The hyperloader
makes things a little tricky
here, so a small&nbsp;program [<A href="#note">note</A>] is
required to get round it:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	<TABLE >
	<TR><TD WIDTH="200" BGCOLOR=gray>
<CODE>10 CLEAR 29999: RESTORE 70<BR>
20 FOR n=1 TO 14<BR>
30 READ a: PRINT n+29999,a<BR>
40 NEXT n<BR>
50 PAUSE 0<BR>
60 RANDOMIZE USR 30000<BR>
70 DATA 221, 33, ?9, 127, 17, 216, 1, 62, 255, 55, 205, 86, 5, 201
</CODE>	</TD></TR>
	</TABLE><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Run this and then start playing
the tape at the first data block
(not the program header) and
press any key to load it. Stop
the tape as soon as it's in, then
use these POKEs:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	<TABLE >
	<TR><TD WIDTH="200" BGCOLOR=gray>
<CODE>80 POKE 32844,207: POKE 32845,26: POKE 32828,251: POKE 32829,201: POKE 32789,243: POKE 32921,0: POKE 33000,0
</CODE>	</TD></TR>
	</TABLE><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, to Hyperload it, enter
RANDOMIZE USR 32789
and re-start the tape. If a
loading error occurs rewind
and try again. When it loads, it
will not start, so for 'x' lives
enter POKE 43883,x. Then
use RANDOMIZE USR
64649 and away you go.
You're now ready to make a
right Wally of yourself.

This code is reproduced as printed in the magazine. There is one obvious error (PRINT instead of POKE), plus the digit marked &quot;?&quot; is printed only as a fragment; it appears to be either a 3 or a 5.

<TR><TD>There are two versions of Pyjamarama, so if you've got the earlier one (without
the demo feature), use the following routine. Owners of the newer version skip
to second routine.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hyper load makes things a bit tricky, so a small program&nbsp;is required to get
round it;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
10 CLEAR 29999: RESTORE 70
20 FOR N=1 TO 14
30 READ A: POKE N+29999,A
40 NEXT N
50 PAUSE 0
60 RANDOMIZE USR 30000
70 DATA 221,33,39,127,17,216,1,62,255,55,205,86,5,201
</pre><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Run this and then start playing the tape from the first data block (not the
program header) and press any key to load it. Stop the tape as soon as it's in,
then use these Pokes;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;80 POKE 32844,207: POKE 32845,26: POKE 32828,251: POKE 32829,201: POKE
32789,243: POKE 32921,0: POKE 33000,0<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, to Hyper load it, enter RANDOMIZE USR 32789 and restart the tape. If a
loading error occurs, rewind and try again. When it loads, it will not start.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 'x' lives, enter POKE 43883,x. Then POKE 48680,50 and RANDOMIZE USR 63524
and away you go You're now ready to make a right Wally of yourself.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you've got the 'demo' version, use this little proggypoo;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
 10 FOR I=23297 TO 23376
 20 READ A: POKE I,A: NEXT I 40 PRINT "PLAY TAPE"
 50 PRINT AT 10,10;:RANDOMIZE USR 23297
 60 DATA
175,55,221,33,96,234,17,17,0,205,86,5,48,242,17,97,234,1,10,0,205,60,32,62,255,55,221,
33,203,92,17,216,1,205,86,5,48,241,243,49,0,0,33,166,93,17,22,128,1,231,0,237,176,
33,63,91,34,61,128,195,22,128,33,72,91,34,229,190,195,36,248
170 DATA 62,X,50,97,171,195,0,130: REM REPLACE X WITH NUMBER OF LIVES
170 DATA 175,50,18,190,195,0,130,0: REM OR USE THIS FOR INFINITE LIVES
</pre><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you can see, there are two line 170's one is for 'x' number&nbsp;of lives and the
other is plain ol' infinite lives. The program doesn't have a checksum, so I
suggest you save it before you run it.
