<TR><TD>I had trouble myself in
starting this  one,  but
remembering  Adams'weird
sense of humour  (and
prompted by Gary Radburn,
gee thanks Gaz!), it eventually
permeated my thick skull that
the Seed Spell might be a
Sesame seed ... casting this
opened the drawbridge of
course!  But,  before you
venture into the Castle, try
exploring  the  surrounding
landscape, as you will find one
of the required Stars at the
very  beginning  of the
adventure.

words at end) and to get rid of
the rats, 11,29,41,3,19,42.

		The latest of Scott Adams' series is a little
unusual too. To me, it bears more similarity
to Infocom's <I>Enchanter</I> and <I>Sorcerer</I> than
to the previous 12 adventures, in that you
must find and use spells to complete your
quest.
<BR>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	The aim is simply to recover 13 lost stars
from Claymorgue Castle but, as ever with
Scott, this is easier said than done. Most
spells work in more than one place so you
must not only obtain them but also find the
correct place to use them. The easiest way is
to experiment - but remember to save
often.
<BR>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Open Sesame&quot; is not the way in, so
don't go by the book - be a little more
imaginative. Don't hold your breath while
worrying about a monster - just get down
out of his way.
<BR>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you've found the kitchen, I won't need
to say much except that 'cabinet' is probably the noun you've been racking your
brain for.
<BR>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A way out is simple to find but the more
baffling items are certainly best left until
later. Your energy might be better spent on
the confines of the plain room!
<BR>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You should by now have unravelled a few
problems, used your seed spell etc. You
could see things a lot more clearly if you
remember Snow White -&nbsp;it might help get
you out of a hole - or into one!
<BR>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Raptures(?) of the Deep' is a danger to
all divers but a little experimentation will get
you out of trouble quite happily.
<BR>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are still content, you could move
up in the world and let Mr. Newton help
you crack the case.
<BR>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little drink will clear the dust from your
throat and help you brave one potentially
fiery demise. Careful not to blow it (?) you
should be no less than three stars the richer.
<BR>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Happier still, a fakir's trick would do you
a favour to make you dizzy with delight.
<BR>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A close look at the battlements should
give you something to aim at and set you up
to finish the adventure.
<BR>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To round things off you'll need to go outside the castle. A bit of pyromania could see
you glowing with pride and really getting
into things (?).
<BR>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having stored some stars it's time to end
it all with yet another dip but this time a nice
dry towel should help once you've reached
the centrepiece of things.
<BR>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't Panic! You should only have one
(and a half?) spells left so the last bit will be
plain sailing.
