<TR><TD>	This is the first of the series and drops the
adventurer right into a forest with exits in
all directions. Happily, escape is one move
away and you find yourself tiptoeing past a
sleeping dragon - you're unarmed and a
little too ripe for roasting at the moment to
tackle him! You may now arrive safely at
the lake shore to find a useful, if rusty,
magical axe and some tantalisingly elusive
fish. Using the power of the ox - sorry -
axe! the first treasure is gained and, hopefully, lost? Things are going swimmingly!
A visit to the top of a bottomless hole may
spark  your  imagination  and  it  soon
becomes clear that Paul's Place is not a fish
and chip shop! Where to go next? Another
overview might help you find your way into
the main part of the adventure.
<BR>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, so good   a place to store the
hard-won  *TREASURE*  and  you've
found the brass lamp that is the good companion to all adventurers. Steadily you
descend into the bowels of the earth - I hope
someone remembered the door key - and
here you will discover the main problems of
the game. First you may encounter some
deadly bees but the fact that they are only
used to sniffing pleasant odours may be
help enough to bottle their anger or steal
their honey! Talking to the brick wall won't
get you through it and me gasbagging won't
help either - or will it? Once the wall is
down is the time to stop and jump for joy!
<BR>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon you meet the first of Scott's
awkward customers - a large, hungry
bear. Be very careful how you deal with this
meanie - he looks the nervous type and
raised voices might push him over the edge!
Your score will be building nicely now with
six treasures in your collection, but&nbsp;don't
let go of the mirror unless you've something soft for it to land on - seven years
bad luck is the last thing you need at the
moment.
<BR>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More confident now you might go and
tackle the maze of pits. Remember it's
warm down there, so&nbsp;you could take a
drink along. Fortunately each part of
the 'maze' is different and you find it's
a veritable gold mine of treasure and
information. Two treasures are there for
the taking - one of them will help you land
a third - and there's a giveaway clue for
two more. You're sure there's something in
the damned lava, if only you could get to it!
The only real snag is how to get out of the
maze - Aladdin might have wished for a
magic carpet - or similar!
<BR>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well that's about it - Oh Yes! - the
dragon? The mirror gives the clue to that
but it could bee you don't need it. There is a
way to finish it in two moves but I'll leave
that to you.
<BR>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Adventureland</I> is  rated  by  AI  as
moderately difficult but typing 'Help'
usually gives a useful clue and I think the
game should suit beginner and master alike.
