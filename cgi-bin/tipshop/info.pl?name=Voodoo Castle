<TR><TD>Firstly, we will examine Adventure 4,
<I>Voodoo Castle</I>, whose storyline was written
by Scott's wife Alexis and, as Scott himself
remarks, &quot;for some reason seems to appeal
to lady adventurers&quot;, although I found it a
lot of fun&nbsp;too!
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The game begins with you standing in an
eerie chapel next to a closed coffin containing a cursed Count Cristo. It is your mission
to lift that curse and restore the Count to
normal life - can you read the inscription
on his sapphire ring?
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beginning to explore the castle, you might
first find a tantalising window that closes as
you reach it and, outside, a raven whose
message can't be heard through the glass.
You'll need to be lucky to get through this
one!
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the armoury you could get equipped in
true adventurer style but the armour itself is
just too heavy to move so you'll have to be
less ambitious. Don't steal too much - try
and keep out of jail.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further afield, a kettle could move you to
a fortunate end or you might be left in the
dark if you've idoled about and not dusted
things up a bit. The whole castle seems
neglected - even the animal trophies seem
about to fall off the wall, or perhaps you
need to cut them off the wall to make it
safe?
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole game takes on a more sinister
aspect as you find evidence of magical
activity as well as some more conventional
science. If you don't want to lose your life
you'd best find something to hide behind
and I'm sure I don't need to remind you of
the dangers of smoking pot!
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A quick, if risky, snack(?) could solve a
growing problem or bring you closer to
death! This may not be a bad thing however, and you might find yourself in clover if
you see what I saw.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discovering where to use the ring will
chute you another part of the story. You
find yourself facing a problem I'd call
medium. Once solved it will give you a far
better clue than I can here and gazing into a
crystal ball could lead to transports of
delight!
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finding somewhere dark to read the
plaque you've collected is no problem -
you did pick it up didn't you? - but the
writing is too small to read. It seems you've
forgotten your spectacles and you won't
find a magnifying glass - don't go to
pieces(?) - I'm sure you'll get round it
somehow.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a quick spin you should be able to
stop the moaning by using the tools you've
picked up. When you've restored the ju-ju
man to life don't be frightened - hear what
he's got to say before you run.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Examining the unstuck bag and its contents, together with Megan's advice, should
set you up to finish this one off, but
<I>Voodoo</I> is a dodgy business so make sure
you have everything you need and follow
the instructions precisely.<br>
