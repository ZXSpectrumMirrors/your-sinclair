<TR><TD>Robert the Nailer, from Devizes Town, confessed he had been searching for the fabled land of Hampstead over many weeks. Though he had boarded a train and met a trader in antiques caller Perrier, he could get no further and was spurned by this odd creature.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my youth - before I worked as a mercenary for Prince Yanga in Maru - I visited the place myself. Set in a maze, amongst the filth and fumes of orcish factories, there is a great treasure. Perrier will be eager to buy this artefact. Robert should thus find his way open, though final success will still be a long way off. To find the secret of the maze he will have to drop his belongings one by one and make a map, for the place is small but tricky.

The vast city of London is full of adventurers struggling to attain Hampstead. Slasher Steele of Gwynedd cannot enter the merchants' bank and pleaded with me for aid. I relented and told him that he should visit a certain club, beyond the stalls and shops in a long street. If he is properly attired he will be given a passport to great wealth.

Richard the Evilcleaver of Poole (24 Hour Service) asked me in a whisper how to enter the gothic mansion owned by Pippa's father. Hark ... when the toady butler speaks, merely ask to 'meet Chubby'. No second chance is given.

all you have to do
to find the credit card in <I>Hampstead</I>, is sit
and wait on the bench on Hampstead
Heath

	From one town to another
- <I>Hampstead.</I> <B>Andrew Wesley</B> of Leamington Spa
doesn't know the area and
he's having trouble finding
the cocktail party. Obviously
been mixing with the wrong
set, eh Andrew? Fortunately,
one of the in-crowd has
written in - <B>S Komar</B> of
Bridgend. So, now, Andrew,
you can cast off the social
stigma of your inferior status
in the game. First, vote for
(3) at the meeting and you'll
find the cocktail party south-
east from a wine bar near
Covent Garden. There you'll
meet Pippa - just give her
pater the memo and the
report. Already your social
standing has rocketed and
you're about to achieve the
fabled Hampstead. Pip pip!

	You need to sit on the bench
on Hampstead Heath to find
the credit card. You will also
need the lathe bracket to give
to the man on the train.

Rawle of Witham joined us outside so we held each other up and complained he could not impress Pippa as he strove for Hampsteadness. Cease this pointless effort and be direct - go GET her, lad!

Five Best Shaw of Maidstone, dressed most sweatily in a tracksuit, complained to me that his search for status and wealth in Hampstead had failed. Penniless in Piccadilly he is, and can raise no cash. Before you travel to Waterloo take a well earned rest upon a bench on Hampstead Heath. Examining that spot well may give you access to a flexible friend.
