<TR><TD>Many games will show different results for similar commands. In Sherlock Holmes 'examine' may deliver little of interest. Add 'closely' to that request and much more may be revealed.
 <i>(Richard Price in Sinclair User issue 35)</i> 

<br><hr>
Gregory Timmis cannot make his way to Leatherhead to help Sherlock solve a case. He should make his way to King's Cross where he may find a fire belching conveyance to take him to the town.
 <i>(Gordo Greatbelly in Sinclair User issue 35)</i> 

<br><hr>
There were a large group, including Ironfist Arends of Hitchin and Whetstone Sharp of York in trouble assisting Sherlock Holmes. Some could not enter Basil's house in London. On Tuesday or Wednesday this evildoer is in residence in the great city, and a window in the back yard should be open. Look through to see if Basil is asleep and enter safely.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the safe in Basil's other house. Wait for him to leave for London on Tuesday and force your way in. To those who ask me how&nbsp;to open the safe - why not say 'Open safe'?
 <i>(Gordo Greatbelly in Sinclair User issue 38)</i> 

<br><hr>
Take
<B>Simon Marshall</B>, for
example, who recommends
stopping Lestrade from
wrapping up the case by
challenging his ideas and
giving him the letters from
Basil's safe. But make sure
you only open it after
midnight.
 <i>(Simon Marshall, Colin Stone in Your Spectrum issue 17)</i> 

<br><hr>
<B>Colin Stone</B> of
Fareham also claims to be
the number one on
<I>Sherlock</I>. He suggests that
you compare Basil's alibi
when you go to his
bedroom. I should think
Basil would want to
examine your credentials
for being in his bedroom
anyway! Colin also suggests
that you closely examine
Sandstone Bridge and any
bookcases you come across
- there may be secrets
behind them.
 <i>(Simon Marshall, Colin Stone in Your Spectrum issue 17)</i> 

<br><hr>
To get people to follow you, you'll
need to ask them <I>three</I> times per move. A
bit long winded, but it works! Paul suggests
trying it out on the cabbie! And while on the
subject of the cabbie - don't pay him.
(<I>Now that's a wise investment. Ed</I>) Why not
ask Daphne about Tricia Fender, you'll get
another address for your collection. Finally,
Paul recommends that you should <I>always</I>
take the lamp.
 <i>(Paul Ridley, John Black, Patricia Black in Your Spectrum issue 20)</i> 

<br><hr>
	First you must take the
lamp, wait for Watson to read
the newspaper article, go to
platform three at Kings Cross
and there you should find
Lestrade. Then go to
Leatherhead by train. Once
you've arrived give the lamp
and your money to Watson, so
you should then be carrying
nothing. Take the bodies from
Sandstone Bridge and Jones'
lounge and place them in
Cobden Lane. <BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Having done this return to
Kings Cross and wait for
Lestrade to appear. He'll call a
cab and get into it; you must
then tell the cabbie to go to
Bishop's Road - hoorah
you've dodged Lestrade. <BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Return to Leatherhead and
wait until 12 am, go to Basil's
bedroom and you'll find him
asleep. Type TAKE BASIL,
go to the library and open the
safe then put Basil in the safe.
Go to Daphne's room (in
Brown's house), take her and
carry her back to the safe. If
you want to have even more
fun put the bodies in the safe
as well.
 <i>(Paul McPherson in Your Spectrum issue 21)</i> 

<br><hr>
To continue past Monday night
you must prove to Lestrade
that Ffoulkes is innocent of the
murder. On Monday evening
you should go to Slater Street
in London and, wearing the
Chinaman's disguise, go north
into an opium den. Wait there
until&nbsp;11:52pm when Percy will
enter. Removing the disguise
will result in him confessing his
addiction. If you go out and
wait until midnight Lestrade
will arrive and you can clear
Ffoulkes and continue into
Tuesday. It is not clear to me
why you should suspect
Ffoulkes of being an opium
addict in the first place, so if
I've missed something let me
know.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If anyone has found the Old
Mill Road, near Leatherhead,
both Chris and I would be
pleased to hear from you.
 <i>(Chris Webb, Neil Cameron in Micro Adventurer issue 17)</i> 

<br><hr>
Sir Lee the Knightley, Pip of Hipwell and the Lady Carol de Whitham have long tried to prove the innocence of the drugged Major, one of Sherlock's suspects.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once you have revealed yourselves to this old soldier in his opium den, there are&nbsp;but two short minutes in which to save him from Lestrade's bullets. Be swift - tell the Inspector simply that the Major has visited the den. The key is 'Visit'. Opium he may eat, lead he need not.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another task for the detective is to solve certain codes found on sundry scraps of paper. Hardiman Harding of Brighton and Jugman Johnson of Sunderland pressed me for the answer. This is not so simple - the torn note and the ripped note are both parts of the same message and have the same code.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consult your great tome - such as the venerable Britannica - for articles on cryptology. In them you may find frequency tables which show the letters used most often in the English tongue. Count the letters in the message to&nbsp;find the most frequent - this should be 'E'. One of the three-letter words is 'THE'. From here, you can begin to build up the message, by guesses and sheer hard work.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly the singed note; care is needed as it is the reply to the others&nbsp;and, curses, is writ backwards! Reverse it and begin your decoding in the same way.
 <i>(Gordo Greatbelly in Sinclair User issue 40)</i>

So we came to the serious matter of Sherlock's murder hunt. Wraithbane Ben of Southwick and many others had found that their time runs out at 1.02 am on Tuesday morning.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Know this, all of you ... that time is when the miserable and erroneous Lestrade arrests that opium-eater Major Ffoulkes. So then 'offically' the murder has been solved! As I have said before it is best to prove the Major innocent before any other task. If you do so time will not stop in its tracks. Go to Sidmouth Street on Monday evening and follow the addict, suitably disguised of course. The quest should normally end between 6 and 8pm on the Wednesday but may go on for longer, now and then.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two others, Gregory de Vauclusle of far Australia and 'Bishop' Colin of London also sought this murderer and looked in a stream for a gun which they are sure was there. They could see no purpose in the hedge. First the hedge - it has as much use as a certain crimson fish. The stream's a different matter ...<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, as before, the major should be proved innocent. Once done, follow Lestrade back to Leatherhead where he too walks beside the stream. Examine all the places thereabouts with care.
