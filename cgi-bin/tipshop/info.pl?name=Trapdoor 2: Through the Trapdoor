<TR><TD>You can either play Berk or Drutt, and in the following solution,
where the name is in capitals, e.g., BERK, that means you should be playing
that character.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 1<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BERK pick up Drutt, wait until the bat has taken Boni down the Trap Door.
Walk to the left and fall down the Trap Door when it has opened.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DRUTT go left to the key screen, lure the bat to the right of the screen.
Make sure Drutt is at the front of the screen, already jumping (depress
'back' key) then jump to the left and back under the key.  Jump for the key
before the bat comes back.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOTE controlling Drutt isn't easy, especially when he's after worms!  There
are conveniently placed 'Druttmarkers' on various screens to help control
him.  Some are invisible, such as the one under the key.  Sending Drutt
left at the front of the screen will cause him to stop at this marker and
jump back.  Pressing 'forward' at this stage will hold Drutt jumping
backwards and forwards 'marking time' while waiting for the next control.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BERK go and get the key, avoiding the spiders and bat.  If 'zapped' with
the key, send Drutt to push it to safety.  BERK go right and down the pit.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DRUTT jump over the pit.  He needs to be right on&nbsp;the edge to jump over,
otherwise he will fall in.  If he does use the column at the left as a
marker, jump high and then onto the shelf in the middle of the screen, mark
time, then jump up and right onto the door screen.  Use left doorpost&nbsp;as a
marker, jump up to the yellow bit of the arch, then left, then up to
release the sweet, then hold right until he's landed.  Push the sweet into
the pit.  BERK pick up the sweet, eat (hold 'back' key down), pick up the
key, go to the middle of the screen, fly up and the right with the key.
Try to go through the door, it will change colour when open.  Collect
Drutt.  Go through door.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 2 (Caves)<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DRUTT jump up chimney (flat area on ceiling just left of door to get&nbsp;the
toadstool and go left into the stalactite screen.  DRUTT go to the left so
that the stalactites start falling down.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BERK go left and mark time at the very right of the screen.  When a green
Monster gets to the right, go to the right, bring down the stalactite to
the left of Berk if it's ready to fall.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BERK go left behind the green Monster, (don't touch), and when fully on
screen, start jumping.  Time the jumping to a maximum without head bumping.
When the green monster&nbsp;approaches jump left, then up.  Do the same for the
next three green monsters.  After the fourth jump to a halt.  Go left.
Jump over Bubo (the yellow thing), but not while he's pooting (throwing out
little white balls).<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DRUTT get toadstool.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BERK eat toadstool.  Pick up Bubo.  Practise putting Bubo down, picking him
up and moving to the left of the screen as quickly as possible.  Go to the
right of the screen.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DRUTT, be on this screen.  When left the green monster will turn right,
BERK follow him.  When he turns towards you, put Bubo down, pick him up
again and go to the left of the screen (now you see what the practise was
for!).  A missile will then descend and zap the green monster.  You MUST be
on the screen as a witness.  If you get zapped, DRUTT get the jumping
mushrooms again, BERK eat them.  You will only need this once as Bubo is
safe to carry.  Return through the stalactites and use the Bubo missiles to
dislodge the key.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 3<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BERK go right, and right, pick eyes, go left, stand in the middle of the
gap on the weight screen.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DRUTT use the upright as the marker, jump high and then onto the shelf,
mark time then high and left to the screen above.  Keep jumping through the
hole in the roof.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BERK eat the eyes, DRUTT keep jumping.  When Berk's lodged at the roof,
jump right.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BERK drop onto upper floor.  Go right.  The object here is to put the
electric eels on the shelves whose colours match those of&nbsp;the eels' noses.
At regular intervals the bulb will change colour.  The claw will grab when
Berk stops, and the best way to deal with it is to lure it down and then to
do the task in small chunks while it's on its way back.  Get two eels close
together and be holding one.  Wait for the colour to change and place eels
without a pause.  Ignore the claw, it'll keep missing you as long as you're
still moving.  If caught the punishment will get more severe each time.
When the eels are in place, an eye falls, BERK, collect it and eat it, go
left and fall.  Pick up weight, go right as far as the eyes, fly up to the
roof, then right.  Do NOT hit the roof.  Do NOT fly too low, either.  As
soon as you're on the next screen, fall.  Fly and fall until 'flyability'
wears off.  Never cross the cyan trap without carrying the weight.  Cross
the trap, put the eyes at the front.  DRUTT push eyes over the trap.  Go
back and bring down the key.  BERK put key at front.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DRUTT push key over trap.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BERK walk back over trap.  Put weight behind you.  Carry key nearly to
middle of the next screen.  Carry eyes and stand behind key.  Do the
following without hesitation.  Eat eyes, pick up key, walk across the
screen and off to the left.  If you muddle at picking up the key, DON'T
walk left.  Stay put and retry when visible and you can get more eyes.
Open door and go through with Drutt.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 4<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BERK go right, avoid the drips, pick up the sausage and eat it.  Go to the
right and stand between two drops.  Wait for a bat to fly over left, jump
up to the roof and then right over the wall, then up to avoid another drip
and skeleton.  Stand between the drip and the skeleton, wait for the bat to
pass to the left, jump higher than the roof, then right, then up, fall down
the pit and move right to avoid the snake.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DRUTT go down the pit, use marker and jump for the key.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BERK get the sausage, eat it.  Get the key and go to the middle of the pit
and fly up and then right.  When flying both the bat and ghost are lethal,
so get the timing right.  You must end up in front of the skull (this is
not Boni).  Eat the sausage, pick up the key and wait for the ghost to come
down.  Fly up and then as far left as you can.  Open the door.  Next go and
collect the skull.  Although it is not Boni, stealing it will make the
skeleton a little more aggressive.  You must fly the skull as far as the
drip screen so that you can use the jump sausage for the next tricky stage.
Pick up the gun, hold under the drips until you have collected about five
or six.  Go right to the wall and put the gun down.  Jump over the wall as
before.  Now you have the gun firing over the wall.  Merely lure the
skeleton left into the gunshots and don't let the skeleton pin you against
the wall.  When the skeleton has been hit, Boni is revealed.  The skeleton
won't be lured to the left until you have the&nbsp;skull.  You now have to get
him over the wall.  Fly him over by getting the sausage by the skull and
making the shortest possible flights over the pit and two walls.  Then you
are ready for HOME SWEET HOME which is through the last door.  Don't worry
about Drutt, he'll mysteriously look after himself.
