<TR><TD>A large group had come from the land of Tir Na Nog and were bewildered by its intricacies.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anstey of Galashiels could not escape the empty lands of Tir Falahm. I could give him no easy answer, as the only way is to make a full map of the area. There is indeed a door but it will only be found by careful exploration and mapping.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Sidhe Hater of Mirfield had become trapped in the great library - again no exit could he find. He told me that he had found some scrolls therein -&nbsp;those contain the answer. One is in a strange tongue and can be ignored, but the other two appear to be jumbled letters, perhaps a code. Code indeed - the smaller of the scrolls reads F4 B3. By moving the first letter of the longer text four letters forward in the alphabet and the next letter three backwards - and so on - a message will appear. There may lie Sidhe Hater's answer.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now a number of those lost souls, including Drakkar Christiansen of Hvidavic and Guald of Tunbridge, could not pass the searing fire of the guardian serpent in Ceardac Callum.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This foul snake will destroy anything which it can see so, naturally, to slide past requires powerful magic and invisibility. On your journeys it may well be that some of you have found the severed halves of a torc. Once joined together they will confer the power of invisibility. But beware - the cauldron you may discover beyond the serpent is an object of power and will nullify the torc's power. Seek the back door and an egg for an N.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Viking of Hvidavic was pleased with that but pressed me further on the doors marked F and C. F is an exit from another place and will generally work only one way, whilst C can be opened by listening to the sound of the letter. Can you hear the waves? Beside them is usually sand. Seek some amongst mouldering books and scrolls.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember too you weary ones who seek the Crown of Cernos - stags need antlers not metal crowns. There are red herrings even in the Celtic afterworlds.

IF YOU ARE having trouble getting past Sidhe Olcweed and those nasty faces in Tir Na Nog, press key 6 once you have been killed to return to the menu. Pressing 1 returns you to where you were - you can't move straight away but you are alive and well.

Grimwood the Exciseman has wandered the paths of the Irish legends too, in Tir Na Nog. Though partially successful he could not find the egg to open the N door. To locate that he should go to Ruads Retreat carrying some sand. Nor could he leave the Row in the Plain of Lies - seek out a secret and invisible door for an exit.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now this Grimwood has tried to read the second scroll he found in the library. He knows it to be written in Ogham, the ancient Celtic script, but his translation is meaningless. The McKenna of Croydon, a battle weary veteran, told us all that the script is corrupt and should read Crossroad Ten North. Perhaps that means ten paces north from a crossroads?
