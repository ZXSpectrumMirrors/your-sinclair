	The fiendish <I>Savage Island I</I> is a quest,
not for treasures but a password that will
get you into the even more diabolical
<I>Savage Island II</I> - hardly what I'd call a
reward. The theme of this pair of adventures is highly original and slowly unfolds
to the more perceptive. If you don't catch
on, don't worry, all is revealed - at the end
of part II!
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You begin in sand again - this time on a
tropical island. You must rely on common
sense and what you see. A lot of items are
obtainable or useable - even if not obviously so.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beach-combing can be a pleasant and
profitable activity. If you don't own a
spade or metal detector don't worry - the
sand is nice and soft.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a little effort you could round off
your exploration by entering the extinct
volcano and add an unwanted and extremely unhelpful item to your inventory.
There's no way I've found to avoid it, you
must rely on luck for now. On this first visit
you might find somewhere safe to save a
drink and a hot-spot that's going to be.
useful later on.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crossing the lake and diving are quite
easy - you've obviously learnt to swim
since <I>Pirate Adventure</I> - but a little extra
buoyancy is needed before you can hang on
to anything you find. If this leaves you with
nothing else to do - don't worry, wait it
out.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now things have really hit the fan! -
stuck in the middle of hurricane Alexis with
no option to save. There's always a chance
you'll be blown away but a noise or two
might lead you to something very heavy
and useful but less dense than water.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next part is so awkward I could
almost tell you what to do and still leave
you plenty of headaches but all&nbsp;I'll do is remind you that there's no wind in the cave
but the present occupant seems to like you
just a little too much. You must deal with
him and collect what you can. A little water
sport, a trip to the seaside will help - with
a little luck you could see your problems
evaporate.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The storm's blown out, movement is safe
again but there's not long left before dark.
There is no safe place to sleep on Savage
Island so you'd best get ready to leave -
quickly. Tarzan's swinging supports will
aid your boat-building activities and,
although it might be a little difficult to handle, you should soon have a seaworthy
craft. Just make sure you build it in the
right place.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shades of <I>Pirate Adventure</I>!&nbsp;- time to
pay a toll and find someone to give the rum
to, this time for a reward and assistance. A
new beach is the next stop, but there's no
fairground in sight despite the fact it's time
to shy a coconut - literally!
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The force is with you! You've found a
light, so now you can retrace your steps and
search behind the dark opening - something smells a little fishy - or worse! but
you might find a short-cut to make up for
it.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back in the tunnels you'll find two
creatures, one of whom is slightly familiar
and more than a little useful. Once this is
sorted you're just about ready for your
password - there is more than one and
everything has a use, so make sure you are
carrying everything you haven't used yet
and it'll be as easy as abc.<br>
