<TR><TD>	Still on Adventure International problems, Neil Smith
of South Wirral is stuck in
Secret Mission. To defuse the
bomb, Neil, try the Pail - it
might be of some use.
 <i>(Tony Bridge in Micro Adventurer issue 10)</i>

	Much of the game relies on
finding and using several keys.
If you're stuck with the
Yellow one, you'll find it
11-20-3-25-20-14-2l and you'll
have to 26-7-23-4-19 to get to
it. (The numbers refer to the
list of clues at the end of this
column.)<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin says that, once the
key has been found, you
should save the game at regular
intervals. The Blue key is
hidden 28-20-28-20-8-12-21-20-
30-21. To obtain the key, 2-
22, according to John, or 13-
22, which is how Martin does
it.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Martin passes on the
tip: "to find out what you are
missing from your inventory,
type SYS32590, although this
will only work occasionally."

To
defuse the bomb, drop the bucket of water
in the rest room. Go to the bomb, cut the
wire, bring the bomb to the bucket and
drop it. Get the bucket and pour water. To
enter the reactor room, open door and then
push hard.

	This is the third title of the series. It's
original title, <I>Mission Impossible</I>, had to be
changed after objections from the company
which made the TV series. It is the first of
the games where you have a goal to achieve
rather than treasures to collect. In this case
you must save a nuclear plant from a
saboteur's bomb.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You begin this task in the briefing room
of the plant alongside a heavy tape
recorder. Playing the tape makes your mission clear but the envelope of goodies
mentioned in the briefing is missing - you
might suspect the character who keeps popping his head around the door! At this
point you may notice that a device has been
implanted in your brain - as if you didn't
have enough headaches already!
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Careful exploration of the areas you can
get to should reveal a network of coloured
passages, a plastic bucket and, most interesting of all, a control console that seems
linked to the security system. Like me you
will probably spend ages at this location.
First red with rage as nothing seems to hap
pen, then white with fear as the bug in your
head wails alarmingly. Perhaps by now you
have heard a dull thud and go off to investigate. An empty pill case shows that perhaps
not only the saboteur's mind was sick - or
was it suicide? However, the deed is done
and your map and information are in pieces
but the villain has left a clue and you can
now progress to the visitors' room. Providing you keep the right company a little
excusable vandalism might lead the way to
the next part of the adventure.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foiled again! A lot of hard work and it
looks as if all you're equipped to do is clean
the place up. Even the old mop looks a little
shaky. If you've got the console sorted out
by now, all areas will be open to you and
you can take out pent up frustration on a
reluctant door, only to find that it's your
fault it wouldn't open in the first place.
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caution is essential when dealing with
bombs and such so make sure you're relaxed before getting down to it - take in a
movie or something. A final word - you
don't have long with the bomb so make
sure everything is ready and in the right
place or you may get a shock!
<BR><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This adventure is rated as Advanced by
AI but I feel this may be an overstatement.
The main trick is in using the console safely
and I've left that to you! As an adventure
with a purpose, <I>Mission</I> is very enjoyable
and an excellent introduction to Scott's
more abstract works like <I>Ghost Town</I> and
the fiendish <I>Savage Island</I>. One point
though - my BBC version was numbered 4
but this is a printing error: <I>Secret Mission</I> is
Adventure 3 and <I>Voodoo Castle</I> is Adventure 4. I hope this stops any confusion.<br>
