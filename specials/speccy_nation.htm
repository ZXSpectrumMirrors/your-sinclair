It isn't every day that you come across something that reinvigorates your soul. It's no secret that I'd become jaded with the Spectrum scene as the community became older, weary, and above all grumpier thirty years after the creation of their favourite computer. We'd pretty much seen it all, done it all, and as the scene shrank as fans moved on to other things, it was only a matter of time before the surrounding politics started killing off the enthusiasm of the remaining group of people. After nearly thirty years of Speccy-related fun and frolics, I retired from the scene and had rarely loaded up a Speccy game since.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Dan Whitehead asked me to review his new book called <i>Speccy Nation</i>, I took it on with casual indifference to the whole subject, going so far as to write it off as just another Speccy Top 100 book before I'd even read a single word of his. If he wasn't the force behind the legendary YS94 2004 special tribute issue of <i>Your Sinclair</i>, I'd have passed on it entirely, such was my apathy to the Speccy.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you ever had one of those days where you're so busy that you had to skip breakfast, and lunch was so late that it was practically dinner? You're so hungry that your taste-buds become hypersensitive to all the individual flavours and textures your eventual meal has to offer. You become aware of flavours within flavours, subtle undertones washing over your tongue, and a new appreciation of what under normal circumstances would be a rather everyday and humdrum meal. A cheese and tomato sandwich suddenly becomes a gourmet festival of flavours that you savour with every bite. <i>Speccy Nation</i> had detected my submerged love for the Spectrum, burrowed hard and fast towards it, and managed to rejuvenate it to the point where I realised that I was merely tired of the "scene", not of the computer itself.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Speccy Nation</i> didn't go down the Top 100 route at all, nor did it take on a pseudo-wacky approach to the games of its day. Instead, Dan targeted a sector of Spectrum history that is so interesting and intriguing that it's a wonder that no one else had thought of doing it before: the British angle. Hidden under the huge pile of coin-op conversions and forgettable movie, toy and TV tie-ins is a rich seam of British originality that got forgotten over the years as the bigger names outshone them. There are games such as <i>Deus Ex Machina</i> where you have to help a single cell evolve into a new life form, and mundane everyday concepts such as bin collecting which get turned into the <i>Trashman</i> games. <i>Speccy Nation</i> revels in all these and more, showing British originality, experimentation and innovation in computer games design which had long been forgotten and taken for granted today.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The book is in five parts, and without spoiling what games are covered in each, I can tell you that the sections are The Classics, The Pioneers, The Greats, The Dark Horses, and Never Again -- games which would never ever get made today by professional software houses. The British innovation angle is used to its maximum potential as Dan covers games which, whilst their execution was pretty poor and attracted rubbish reviews back in the day, the concepts being attempted were so novel that they would later be re-factored and re-imagined into monster hit games in later years on newer machines. Being shown the direct line between today's stealth games and a mediocre 1984 Spectrum title was a revelation to this jaded historian -- <i>Speccy Nation</i> is a book which was teaching this tired old dog some new tricks.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The writing is spot-on. Dan still thinks that <i>Your Sinclair</i> is the greatest computer magazine of all time (and he is correct), and his writing style inherits <i>YS</i>'s chatty enthusiast vibe whilst bringing it up to date for a more mature audience -- the first issue of <i>YS</i> was published over 25 years ago, we can't all still be into going "oo-er" and "wibble" these days! Not a single "wa-hey!" was to be found, and the book is stronger for that. Not only is the book well researched and thought out, it's also very funny indeed. And to complete the <i>YS</i> lineage, Dan managed to get Phil South, one of the architects of the original <i>Your Sinclair</i> style, to write a suitably nostalgic foreword to kick everything off with.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reading through the book was a curiously wonderful experience as after reading a game review, I'd sometimes stop and search YouTube for videos of it being played, bathing in fresh waves of nostalgia as various Speccy-related memories and feelings worked their way back to the surface after a few antagonistic years in the community sought to bury my love for the machine. I sat through a half-hour video of a game of <i>Chaos</i> -- a game I find completely impenetrable to play -- and was transfixed. As the book continued to be read, the enthusiasm I had for the machine kept recovering until I had that final important epiphany: I hadn't out-grown the Spectrum, just the community that remained around it. I even started getting ideas of what to do the next time I had a chunk of free time to dedicate to Speccy things.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can buy the paperback book from Amazon for &pound3.99, and that includes postage and packing. That, frankly, is a steal. When I discovered that it's also available on Kindle for just &pound;1.02 my jaw dropped. That's cheaper than an issue of <i>Your Sinclair</i> was, even before you took into account inflation. This is an absolute bargain and would justify a higher price.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buy this book if you had any exposure to the ZX Spectrum back in the day. And if you think you've outgrown the Spectrum now that decades have passed, buy this book and prepare to be surprised -- there's plenty of interesting stuff that you have either forgotten or missed the first time around.
