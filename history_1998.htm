<!-- START -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">24th December 1998</FONT></b> : <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">MERRY CHRISTMAS!!!</FONT> No update yet (wait for a mega update around New Year time - you'll <i>love</i> it!) This site is just coming up to the 20,000th visitor - if you're it, give me an email and I'll give you a mention!<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">20th December 1998</FONT></b> : OK, so the new pages haven't materialized yet. Other things have taken priority. Normal service will be resumed shortly, and hopefully some new pages for the New Year.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">1st December 1998</FONT></b> : A Happy Advent to all those who celebrate it. Tweaked the <a href="articles/test.htm">test new-style review page</a> so that Netscape 4 doesn't lose the colours in the link table. The reported problems with Netscape 3 are about to be investigated (just have to install it first).<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">30th November 1998</FONT></b> : Things are afoot - the site's due to have a big expansion in the next week or two. It's mainly visually and technically, but there'll also be a lot more articles. For a sneak preview, take a look at this <a href="articles/test.htm">test page</a> and let me know if you have any problems viewing it.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">22nd November 1998</FONT></b> : Extended the section about CLEAR to include a <a href="http://145.13.42.3/~mheide/permits/permits.html">link to a World Of Spectrum page that explodes various myths about Speccy emulation</a>. Unfortunately, a lot of people on <a href="news:comp.sys.sinclair">comp.sys.sinclair</a> decided to shoot the messenger rather than help protect the Speccy emulation scene... Quite disappointing really. I actually thought that the Speccy emulation scene was different to all other emulation scenes because the people involved in it actually <i>cared</i> about it, in contrast to the console emulation scene which appears to be filled with people who only want the free games - you live and learn... I sometimes wonder if I should continue this site... Anyway, we'll see what happens.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">19th November 1998</FONT></b> : Added a link to <a href="http://dialspace.dial.pipex.com/town/estate/dh69/clear/">CLEAR</a> (the Campaign to Leave Emulation Alone) to the <a href="cover1.htm#links">Links</a> section. In case you haven't heard, an American trade body called the IDSA (International Digital Software Association), who represents many of today's software houses, are trying to outlaw the use of <b>any</b> emulator for <b>any</b> machine for <b>any</b> purpose. As unreasonable as their reason-to-be is, they have a bit of clout and have already shut down a major archive of emulator ROM files. The IDSA's main argument is that any time you spend playing games on an emulator <i>should</i> be spent playing (as well as buying) the new games for your PC (or whatever machine you actually own). They still haven't told me where I can find Head Over Heels for the PC, but there you go. Should they get their way in America, this movement will spread to Europe and will be enforced by FACT over here. Please go to CLEAR's website and see what you can do to help prevent this.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">2nd November 1998</FONT></b> : Added <a href="cover1.htm#links">Links</a> section to cover page and also added links to the <a href="cover1.htm#goodeggs">Good Eggs</a> section. Also, in a fit of self-indulgence, added the <a href="kudos.htm">Kudos</a> page.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">1st November 1998</FONT></b> : Some news sections of the summary pages beefed up. I'm currently trying to figure out a way of conveying the world of hype surrounding various releases on the Spectrum, especially the Christmas bonanzas. Anyone have any suggestions on how to do this?<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">31st October 1998</FONT></b> : A small tweak to the formatter - now all review entries are sorted according to rating. (It's amazing the things you do to put off doing the next bit on the site! ;))<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">27th October 1998</FONT></b> : Articles now linked with main bit of the summaries. Also reviews are linked to (almost) every mention of the game that it's the review of - just click on the <IMG SRC="review.gif" ALT="REVIEW"> icon to display it. Now stuck for new display ideas... Actually, I might now get around to writing a few new features (Story So Far, Arcade Emulation, maybe a couple of others).<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">23rd October 1998</FONT></b> : After five months' scanning all issues of YS (well, all 91 that I have - Jonathan Nash provided the YS93 text, but YS92 is still to be done) I've completed the first pass. 27 articles have been added, bringing the total up to 492 (456 reviews, 36 other articles). Time for a breather. More might be added soon (just sorting out permissions). A special <a href="articles/index_sam.htm">SAM Index</a> page has been added which lists all SAM related articles on the site, including previews, reviews and news articles. <a href="jugglers/index.htm">Joystick Jugglers</a> completed - all piccies that appeared in those panels are now on that page. A few more to be added from other cartoons (particularly after one of T'zer). Ideas for what to do next gratefully accepted. Links section to be added to the cover page "soon" - will be just the basics so that, cunningly, someone else is responsible for keeping them up to date. <i>(Yes readers, he'll link to the FAQ, WOS and Planet Sinclair only - you'll be able to get to anywhere else from their links. Ed)</i>.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">14th October 1998</FONT></b> : Since Jonathan Nash has assured me that Jon Pillar is dead (and, presumably, can't object to me putting up his articles onto this site), 18 more articles have been put up. You can see which 18 by going to <a href="articles/Jon_P.htm">Jon Pillar's articles page</a> as they're spread through a few issues. Lesley Quigg's piccy added to the <a href="jugglers/index.htm">Joystick Jugglers</a>.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">13th October 1998</FONT></b> : It's Jonathan Nash's turn to be Hero Of The Week - he's provided the "Editor's Cut" (or, more probably, the Subeditor's Cut) of a few articles from YS93, the last issue of YS. They include the <a href="articles/ysspeak.htm">Guide To YS-Speak</a>, <a href="articles/thegamesthattimeforgot.htm">Games That Time Forgot</a> and Jonathan Davies' excellent <a href="articles/ysstory.htm">YS Story</a>.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">12th October 1998</FONT></b> : Due to having much more free time on my hands nowadays (whether I like it or not!) I'm slowly getting around to doing things that I've been putting off for a while, so now you have a <a href="articles/index.htm">decent article index</a> in small bite-size chunks. Also scanned 24 articles from YS issues 10 and 11.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">27th September 1998</FONT></b> : 22 reviews added, now up to YS80. Now have 424 articles online, 394 of them games reviews. As a result, the <a href="articles/index.htm">Articles Index</a> page is a bit on the big side (93k!) - this will be "fixed" "soon".<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">25th September 1998</FONT></b> : 19 more articles added, taking us up to YS72 on the first article-scanning pass. Coverscan links updated to take into account the new filing system at WoS.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">23rd September 1998</FONT></b> : <a href="articles/peopleindex.htm">Reviews by Reviewer</a> page added.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">16th September 1998</FONT></b> : <a href="faq.htm">Site FAQ</a> added.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">14th September 1998</FONT></b> : <a href="guestbook.htm">Guest book</a> added. The Rock'n'Roll Years will feature in an article written by David McCandless for this Thursday's Daily Telegraph. The article covers the Spectrum's impact on today's games industry. Also in the article is an interview with Sir Clive himself.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">3rd September 1998</FONT></b> : A few more articles put up (up to YS66 now). Bad news for Backlash fans - Iolo Davidson has asked for the articles to be taken down.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">1st September 1998</FONT></b> : More articles put up (now up to YS64 - currently have 340 game reviews plus 36 other articles). Also reinstated a reworded and more discrete disclaimer at the end of each article - before, the articles were just sitting ducks for those who wanted to steal them. And, if you're wondering why the sudden rash of updates - I was made redundent last week (all together now - aaaaaaahhhhhh!). If you know anyone who needs a UNIX C/C++/shell script type person, let me know.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">30th August 1998</FONT></b> : Tidied up the "front page" of this site - now looks a lot tighter. Also added a shortcut bar at the top as the front page is a little on the big side (the page needs a complete redesign, really - trying to come up with a good one).<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">29th August 1998</FONT></b> : More articles up - now up to YS60! Coverscans now clickable again - scans are stored on the World Of Spectrum site, courtesy of Martijn. Slight redesign to the articles pages - disclaimer on the front page now, rather than cluttering up each article page. More info added to the Joystick Jugglers, including one bit which will <i>shock</i> YS readers of old! Also added a separate section for YS writers who have blessed this site by allowing me to put their articles on here.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">9th August 1998</FONT></b> : Screenshots for issue 25 put up, courtesy of Paul Jenkinson. Also added a <a href="howto/index.htm">section on how this site is created</a> - an interesting read if you're a UNIX bloke like me.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">22nd July 1998</FONT></b> : Done articles for issues 49 and 50 - will now take a small break from scanning. Also reformatted the new ratings box so that it looks nicer, as well has adding more ALT tags to the main issue pages so that they're easier to view using Lynx. Updated stats: 305 articles (281 reviews, 24 others) and 646 screenshots.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">12th July 1998</FONT></b> : More articles up - now done the major articles for the first 48 issues! Now planning to do the next two issues (to cover the Xmas 89 releases) and then will take a small break from scanning and look at other parts of the site.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">5th July 1998</FONT></b> : Got the new reviewing system implemented - take a look at the articles in <a href="ys41.htm">YS41</a> and <a href="ys42.htm">YS42</a> and let me know what you think. Paul Jenkinson has also kindly sent in screenshots for issues 23 and 24, so we've now got blanket screenshot coverage for the first two years of YS!<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">4th July 1998</FONT></b> : Now covered most of the most important/interesting reviews of the first 40 issues (bar ones with ridiculous colour schemes - now have a decent OCR package which can transform colour articles to b&w easily, but a few still are impossible to scan in). There are now 249 articles on the site! As old YS readers know, the rating system changed with issue 41 from the traditional YS Clapometer to the horrible, horrible (horrible!) Final Verdict (you remember, the one with the thermometer and ambiguous subratings...). Next job is to find a way of implementing that nicely in the review pages on this site. One more thing - Matt Bielby's Joystick Juggler piccy has been added.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">28th June 1998</FONT></b> : Articles up to YS 35 up now, as well as the revamped <a href="articles/index.htm">article index page</a>. Article scanning will now be slower than before - from issue 35 onwards, the YS Art Dept had the wonderful idea of putting multi-coloured backgrounds behind every single review. It looks all very pretty, but it's a sod to scan in when dealing with black and white OCR packages. Currently trying to find a decent colour OCR package that can do the job.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">14th June 1998</FONT></b> : More articles put up - now have most of the important reviews from the first 30 issues up. Some stats for you: There are now 177 articles on this site - 161 reviews, 16 others. There is an astonishing 610 screenshots on this site, and Paul Jenkinson is only up to YS22! Oh, one more thing - David McCandless has given me permission to use his articles on this site - he's moved on up in the world and is now both a journalist and a musician nowadays. Visit his website at <a href="http://www.wakeywakey.com">http://www.wakeywakey.com</a>.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">10th June 1998</FONT></b> : *Cough* Articles put through a spell-checker... (Sorry about the typos) Changed the WOS search icon in the reviews to the official one, and added a few articles from YS25 (Jan'88). Problems regarding viewing with image loading switched off will be sorted out "soon".<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">7th June 1998</FONT></b> : ARTICLES NOW UP!!!!!! You may find a few articles linked to the first 24 issues on their respective pages, and you may also use <a href="articles/index.htm">the temporary index file</a> for a quick A-Z. I say temporary because it's going to be better designed and formatted in the future. A word about the article selection - these articles are scanned in, so only articles which were printed in an easily-readable way (no stupid colour schemes, for instance) will be scanned on the first pass. The second pass well be a different matter... Also, some reviews are smaller than they appeared in a few cases - this is due to extensive use of annotated screenshots/artwork and a workaround will appear in due course. If you see any typos, please E-mail me. Also added screenshots for issues 21 and 22, and now all screenshots are stored in the local webspace - no more putting up with slow FortuneCity!<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">3rd June 1998</FONT></b> : Good news! The form now displays correctly on all browsers bar IE3-... why Microsoft botched it, I don't know, but I am indebted to Jus Walters for helping me out on this one. Also made a few tweaks so that the article pages appear even better in Lynx than they did. Another bit of good news is that the limit has been raised to 25Mb, so expect a lorry load of articles by the weekend! A minor point is that the web counter has been reset - this should be fixed/fixable tomorrow.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">1st June 1998</FONT></b> : I think I've cracked it - I <i>think</i> I can safely say that the <a href="/ys/articles/test.htm">test review page</a> will appear well with any browser. Apart from one problem - that blasted WOS search button (yep, finally put it in!). Can <i>anyone</i> tell me how to stop it putting a newline after itself and getting it into a centred position in its table cell? This is driving me <i>nuts</i>!<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">31st May 1998</FONT></b> : After a very long wait, articles and reviews will be added to the YS Rock'n'Roll Years website very very very soon (just waiting for Claranet to flick the switch that bumps up my webspace from 5Mb to 25Mb). In the meantime, please have a look at <a href="/ys/articles/test.htm">this page</a> to see how a typical review page would look like, and tell me if it displays strangely on your browser. I know that in Netscape 3 the screen shot doesn't appear correctly (anyone got a fix for that?), and the WOS link is a simple hyperlink to the WOS search page (using a form button like in the other pages puts a newline in right after it, which widens the box it's in in the table - does anyone know how to stop that from happening?) Take a look - it's even very very Lynx-friendly :) Also added pics for Rachael Smith and Cliff Joseph to the <a href="/ys/jugglers/index.htm">Joystick Jugglers</a> page.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">17th May 1998</FONT></b> : Screenshots for Issues 19 and 20 put up, and Paul Jenkinson has also kindly written up entries for the last two issues.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">13th May 1998</FONT></b> : Pages reformatted a little - a sidebar has been added that eases traversal, and will also be the location for links to articles for that issue. Let me know if you have any problems viewing the pages.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">2nd May 1998</FONT></b> : More cover scans up! Now have all covers - I suppose it now means that the <a href="ys29.htm">YS29 page</a> will cease to be the most hit page so far ;). Added a page that allows you to <a href="covers.htm">view all the YS covers on one page</a>. <a href="http://www.clara.net">ClaraNet</a> has announced that the webspace will be going up to 25Mb on the 31st of May, so expect some extensions after that date.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">19th April 1998</FONT></b> : <a href="jugglers/index.htm">Joystick Jugglers finally up!</a><br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">18th April 1998</FONT></b> : No updates for a long time, I know. This is due to increased workload at the moment. Scanning has started - scanned most of the most interesting 1986 articles and reviews and will be putting them up "soon", probably over the next two months (work deadlines and holidays are getting in the way). The long-awaited Joystick Jugglers feature has been typed up and just needs formatting, so will get that done and up "soon". The webspace that ClaraNet is supplying me will go up to 25Mb from 5Mb, so expect some site expansions. Currently toying with the idea of doing an Arcade Emulation feature (fancy playing the <b>Arcade</b> version of OutRun or Gauntlet on your own PC?), as well as a section on the pre-YS days (working title "Story So Far...") which will be a quick summary on the events of 1983-5, hopefully not stepping on Jim Grimwood's toes in the process. However, all this will take time - I'm a programmer by trade and, well, sometimes the last thing I want to see after work is a computer, let alone update the site on one. Having said that, expect some site updates during May.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">29th March 1998</FONT></b> : Issue 18 screenshots up. Bad news on the cover-scans front - FortuneCity have started to take exception to me storing scans in their free webspace and have started taking them down. This means that, for the time being, the cover thumbnails aren't clickable anymore. Does anyone feel like donating 30Mb of web/FTP space to hold them?<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">8th March 1998</FONT></b> : 1992 and 1993 entries up!!! All issues of YS apart from the very last two have entries now, and the other two should be going up "soon" once I get the issues thru the post. YS - I never knew there was so much in it!<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">5th March 1998</FONT></b> : Finally fixed the table-formatting problems in MSIE 3 and earlier. Turns out that the /TR tag isn't <i>quite</i> as optional as the definition claims. Ironically, the site now looks <i>better</i> with MSIE 3 since it doesn't space out table rows when you use a form-style button. Screen shots finally on-line. Also, due to disk space limitations, I've removed the view-by-month and view-by-year pages.The pages are due to be expanded "soon" (now have more issues of Your Sinclair, and issues of Your Spectrum in the post) so will be redesigning the website so that you can traverse it better.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">2nd March 1998</FONT></b> : Re the WOS icon/form problem. It appears to be putting a newline at the end of the form when the form is displayed. This is highly irritating as I do not want a newline there, neither have I specified one. So, to even out each row with this icon on, I've put a newline at the end of every other cell in that row. It spaces them out a little bit more, but at least everything lines up now.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">1st March 1998</FONT></b> : Another format change - this time, to avoid confusion for underlined game names, I've given screenshots an icon of their own. To see a shot from the game, click on the <img src="scr.gif"> icon. Also added links to shots for issue 17, but due to problems with FortuneCity, you still won't be able to view these for a few days.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">28th February 1998</FONT></b> : Minor format fixes (can anyone tell me why the rows which have the <img src="download.gif"> icon are widely spaced in some browsers but not others? i.e. it looks fine with IE3, but not IE4, and not in any Netscape neither). Search links improved - it's now more intelligent, searching only on the first three meaningful keywords in the game name. This should get you more hits for each game. Top Tens for Nov'88 and May'89 added, courtesy of Martin Currey.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">25th February 1998</FONT></b> : You can now SEARCH for snapshots of games mentioned!! Clicking on the <img src="download.gif"> icon will search the <a href="http://www.void.demon.nl/spectrum.html">World Of ZX Spectrum</a> website for the game. Many thanks to Martijn van der Heide for allowing me to do this, and helping with the HTML. Also, Paul Jenkinson has supplied screenshots for issues 15 and 16. Unfortunately, due to problems with FortuneCity, you can't view these new screens just yet. FortuneCity says that everything should be OK within a week.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">18th February 1998</FONT></b> : YS13 and YS14 screens up. No word from Future yet... maybe they're not bothered about YS copyrights?<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">14th February 1998</FONT></b> : Screenshots for the whole of 1986 are up! There are now so many I've had to move all the screens to FortuneCity. Also, sorry about the downtime Friday/Saturday - made a small cock-up (I think...). Should be OK now.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">8th February 1998</FONT></b> : More screenshots added - now up to YS10.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">6th February 1998</FONT></b> : Screenshots for YS7 and YS8 up! Meanwhile, currently in contact with Future Publishing about having actual game reviews on this site. Will let you know what happens.<br>
<!-- MIDDLE -->
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">31st January 1998</FONT></b> : More screenshots added (up to YS6 now), and made use of ALT tags when marking up images so that people with text-only browers are able to traverse the site easier. Tidied up the cover page - the What's New section was getting rather large, so that has a page of its own now, and details of the three latest changes are now displayed on the cover page. Good Eggs section added to cover page, so that credits aren't hidden away on the What's New page.<br>

<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">30th January 1998</FONT></b> : WOOHOO! Saviour of the week is Paul Jenkinson, who is <i>very</i> kindly going thru each issue of YS and getting screenshots of every game mentioned! Screenshots for the first four issues are now up and there's many more to come. Also changed the formatting slightly in the listings.<br>

<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">21st January 1998</FONT></b> : Cover scans made clickable! The GIFs are held on www.fortunecity.com and each are between 200k and 400k, so be warned that since these are high-quality scans, the files are fairly big.<br>

<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">18th January 1998</FONT></b> : Cover scans added! (YAY!!!) Huge thanks should go to Gerard Sweeney for scanning probably every possible piece of artwork that's ever appeared in YS - what a total star!! At the moment this site only contains thumbnails of the original scans - I intend to make these 'clickable' in the future once I get hold of 13Megs of web space to hold the original high-quality scans. Joystick Jugglers to come.<br>
