I am the sister of Duncan MacDonald who wrote Lawnmower Sim. 
He's not on the Internet (indeed barely has a computer) so 
he has never seen your site, but he has heard about it, and 
I am spying for him. I am giving him my old computer setup 
so he will see it soon... 

PS your site is a legend with ex-YS/Dennis Publishing people

Glad I found this site! I think I ave the full set of 
YS and Sinclair User and I want a good home for them. Soon.
I'm 74 and in poor health so I'm beginning a big clear-out. I'm sure somebody
could make use of the mags. And I think they contain all the posters etc which
came with them. I don't get on the net very often but if someone would care to
phone me on 01282 - 615037 I'd be very pleased. If they are of use, then perhaps
a small donation to my favourite charity? Incidentally, I'm in N.E.Lancashire.

Until I found all the speccy nostalgia stuff on the net I used to feel like I was
the only person in the world who got so nostalgic about it all. Loading up Sabre
Wulf and hearing that beautiful title tune (a poor version of a prelude from
Bach's "Well Tempered Clavier" I've since learned) takes me back to the
early/mid-eighties again, a time when upgrading meant buying a joystick, when we
stood gaping at arcade coin-ops like Outrun dreaming that maybe one day home
computers might be able to have games as good as that, Battlestar Galactica
ruled, & I used to argue with my Atari ST owning friends about whether Defender
Of The Crown was as much fun as Chuckie Egg.
I discovered a site where the person running it had undertaken the huge task of
contacting all the old speccy software houses to get their permission to
distribute the games, to avoid hassles of the fiends who try to shut down these
emulation sites (maybe distributing N64 ROMS damages sales, but who can possibly
be losing out by me downloading the speccy version of Ant Attack?) . He had
tracked down a programmer of a few games published by one of the well known
speccy software houses (can't remember which now), and the programmer had told
him that the copyright of the games belonged to the owner of the software house,
but not to worry about being pursued for breach of copyright as the guy now ran a
company selling kitchens. It shattered all my illusions. To me the software
houses of my childhood were vast monolithic organisations, employing hundreds of
staff, with dozens of projects on the go at once. It's so sad to think that most
of them were probably just small businesses run by people who have long ago lost
all interest in the wonderful world of the speccy.
Seeing that image from the last issue of YS of the 2 riders disappearing into the
sunset, it brought tears to my eyes. I miss those days so much.

PLEASE HELP ME!!
I am desperately trying to find a game for the speccy, but I can`t remember what
it is called.
It was in 3d wireframe graphics, (but with hidden line removal I think). You were
in a helicopter flying around a city, you had to manouvre between skyscrapers
(like a very primitive version of G-Police). I think you had to shoot round blobs
or something. I think I remember that according to the blurb it was set near the
sea, and therefore had very unconvincing fog that descended sometimes (the
display just went blank from the top of the screen downwards.)
If anyone out there remembers what it was called PLEASE let me know.

Nice to see the old spectrum still has a following. I did a search on a spectrum
game i wrote in 1985 called Antteroo which I found listed on your site. It was
reviewed in YS magazine (not favourably though!) I didnt expext to find anything
about it on the net but just shows you.

Anyway Thanks

Superb site - brings back memories of the greatest magazine (on any subject)
EVER. How about including an option to download 'Whistlin Rick' Wilson's monster
hit 'Hold my hand very tightly' - I'm sure many old readers would appreciate it.
(I still have a copy: if you haven't got access to it - email me).

What a great site, I subscribed to YS for ages and had nearly all issues! You can
guess what happened when I moved house a couple of years ago.
I must find out if my 2 48k speccys are still in working order along with about
400 games, printer tape drive. I went mad way back then.
Wonder where they are now.
