The Tipshop was an idea dreamt up by <b>Gerard Sweeney</b> and <b>Nick Humphries</b> in May 2001 after
they decided that what the Spectrum and SAM emulation scene really needs nowadays is a centralised
tips archive, rather than have a lot of smaller ones spread around the web. So Gerard and Nick,
drawing on their experiences with (respectively) <a href="http://fly.to/ha3">Hack Attack III</a> and
<A href="http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/">The Your Sinclair Rock'n'Roll Years</a>, came up with The Tipshop,
and we think it's rather nifty.<p>

Due to the size of the database involved, we've had quite a bit of help with the supply of tips from
all the printed Speccy magazines we could get our hands on, so here's a list of who did roughly what 
(in no particular order):<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Nick Humphries</b> (Webmaster) - Database design, website design and data import.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Gerard Sweeney</b> (Webmaster) - Tips from Your Sinclair, plus all the Multiface Pokes from Hack Attack III.<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Jim Grimwood</b> - Tips from Your Spectrum and Micro Adventurer, plus details of what hacks, POKEs and tips were on the magazine cover tapes.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dave Foreman</b> - Tips from Sinclair User.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Matthew Wilson</b> - Tips from Crash.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Martijn van der Heide</b> - General deity, providing help and resources.<p>

You should recognize those last four names because they run (respectively):<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~jimg/">The Your Spectrum Unoffical Archive</a>,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sincuser.f9.co.uk/">SUMO - Sinclair User Magazine Online</a>,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mjwilson.demon.co.uk/crash/">Crash: The Online Edition</a> and, of course,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.void.jump.org/">The World Of Spectrum archive</a>.<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Andy Barker</b> - For letting us pinch the YS Smash Tips archive from <a href="http://www.sunderland.ac.uk/~as0aba/">his own website</a>.<p>

These people deserve our deepest thanks and respect for using up a lot of their spare time to help
this website, and the Speccy emuscene in general.<p>

The website is hosted by <a href="http://www.webaxxs.com">WebAxxs</a>, and uses Perl CGI scripts that retreives
data from a MySQL database. Although The Tipshop is hosted in the same webspace as the YS Rock'n'Roll
Years, it is a completely separate entity and is aimed to cover <i>all</i> Spectrum and SAM tips,
not just those printed in Your Sinclair.<p>

<b>Legal gubbins:</b> You may not sell the contents of this site in any form. No exceptions. Partly
because it will be bloody difficult and time-consuming to make an offline version of this site 
(although one is planned in the future), but mainly because we're tired of people ripping off
the Speccy and SAM emuscene as it is.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you're a webmaster who wants to use material from this website, feel 
free to <i>link</i> to the relevant URL. We'd prefer you linked to our site via our home page<p>

<center><a href="http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/tipshop/">http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/tipshop/</a></center><p>

or through our 
search engine for a specific game. For example, if you want to link to our tips for Chase HQ, link to<p>

<center><a href="http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/cgi-bin/tipshop.pl?name=chase+hq">http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/cgi-bin/tipshop.pl?name=chase+hq</a></center><p>

as we might want to move/rename/delete the other CGI scripts. The tipshop.pl CGI script will <i>always</i>
be around.<p>
