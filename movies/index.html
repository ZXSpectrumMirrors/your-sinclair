You'll probably have noticed the intro movies on the <a href="../index.htm">entrance page</a> of this website. Sometimes I put a new movie 
up, and the old one gets lost in the process. Well, not any more! This page contains all the movies that have appeared on this site,
and you have a choice as to which method to view them:<br>
<UL>
	<li><font color="yellow"><b>Online version</b></font> - this takes you to a webpage with the Flash animation embedded into it. This is recommended for 
broadband users because there's a bigger download required for uncompressed Flash files.</li>
	<li><font color="yellow"><b>Offline version</b></font> - a zipfile containing an HTML file and the Flash file. You uncompress this on your own PC, and then
view the webpage locally. Recommended for dial-up users.</li>
	<li><font color="yellow"><b>Windows EXE</b></font> - For people without the ability to play Flash files, this is a zipped-up stand-alone Windows application
which you uncompress and run locally. Also recommended for dial-up users, it also has the advantage of being able to view the animations
full-screen if you wanted, rather than in a window.</li>
</ul>

"Cursor Productions", by the way, was the name that I sold my own Spectrum and SAM programs under.<p>

<tr><td colspan=2><IMG SRC="ysmovie1.jpg" align="right">So-called because it reminds me very much of presentations done using Powerpoint. It's
a very simple animation, my first play about with Flash, and it's just a lot of simple-moving graphics moving to the 128k music
from Chase HQ. I think this was done in two or three weekends - the hardest bit was thinking up what to put in it.

<tr><td colspan=2><IMG SRC="ysmovie2.jpg" align="right">I wanted to do an epic, and kind of do it in a similar way to the animations used at the
start of the Pink Panther movies. I was originally going to have Monty Mole go through a lot of scenes being attacked, cartoon-style,
by Miner Willy, but it just didn't work, so instead had Monty go through various games avoiding various dangers. I'm really proud of the way 
it came out, and the way it does everything to the background music (ripped from CDs this time, rather than using Spectrum tunes) most 
of the time. At about four minutes in length, it took about eight or nine weekends to do, not counting all the planning.

<tr><td colspan=2><IMG SRC="xmascard2000.jpg" align="right">A quick electronic Christmas card I put together in a couple of weekends. I got the
idea after hearing that the RAF is spending a million pounds to investigate the urban myth that penguins fall on their backs and are
unable to get back up on their own if they stare at a helicoptor flying overhead. This is happening in the Falklands, of course, and
not Antarctica, but what's wrong with a bit of artistic licence every now and then?!
