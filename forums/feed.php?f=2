Thanks for the mention Nick.<br /><br />I must say that I to was intrigued by Matthew Wilson's early attempts at putting <span style="font-style: italic">Crash</span> onto Kindle.  So much was my interest piqued that I have downloaded the KindleGen program and quickly (and erratically) converted a couple of pages from <span style="font-style: italic">Your Computer Online</span>.  The results are fairly impressive - even if I say so myself. I would be interested to hear about any attempts that you make with regard to <span style="font-style: italic">Your Sinclair</span> being converted.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=77">Meurglys68</a> — Mon Aug 01, 2011 8:21 pm</p><hr />

It's August, which means it's officially summer. As I live at the crap end of the country (weather-wise), I'm looking out of the window at a very dark sky whilst listening to Test Match Special. It's lunch time and I need to turn a light on. Joy...<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic">Anyway...</span> When I'm not caught up in Real Life Stuff, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flVY6I41W2c" class="postlink">creating a two-minute advert for the site relaunch</a> or writing silly scripts such as <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05Vh77qLMic" class="postlink">one which collected together a bunch of animated loading screen reveals</a>, I still dip my toe into researching for the <a href="http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/tvprog/" class="postlink">documentary</a>. Occasionally I get fresh insights into the goings on in the industry, and recently had a bit of a revelation about the infamous magazine Cover Tape Wars.<br /><br />As the documentary is up to 1990, you should know the story so far. You haven't seen the videos? Boy are you in for a treat - go <a href="http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/tvprog/downloads.htm" class="postlink">watch them now</a> and we'll still be here twiddling our thumbs when you get back. Twiddle, twiddle, twiddle. Right. Back? Good. As you saw, all three major Speccy mags now have monthly cover tapes, and CRASH  is pamphletized as they went all-in by stuffing their tape with re-releases at the expense of having a magazine with actual pages with actual articles in. I've <a href="http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/cgi-bin/advent.pl?day=20" class="postlink">commented on this</a> a few times, so I'll bypass the rant and go straight on to 1991.<br /><br />Of course, Your Sinclair and Sinclair User were rereleasing the odd game on their cover tapes, but when SU announced it was considering going down the CRASH route and beefing up their cover tape with more rereleases at the expense of shrinking the magazine due to having little new to write about, industry body ELSPA cleared their throat and complained. Reading the SU letters pages reveals that a little more went on behind the scenes. ELSPA not only complained, they also blackmailed the magazines to their way of thinking: cut down on the number of rereleases or we'll cut down on the amount of advertising from our members (pretty much every software house) - and, acknowledging that their advertising had gone down recently, they also dangled the carrot of <span style="font-style: italic">extra</span> advertising if the mags played ball.<br /><br />YS was pretty quiet on this whole episode, preferring backroom diplomacy to SU's swaggering, so they quietly complied. SU also complied, but then complained in their letters pages when the extra advertising wasn't forthcoming, implying that ELSPA had stiffed them - after all, SU was ready to switch to the pamphletized format and only backed away from doing so when ELSPA started clearing their throat. For CRASH, though, ELSPA's demands were devastating to their two-year-old strategy of shrinking their mag in order to cram more games onto their tapes. All this time I thought that their 1991 return to the traditional magazine format was due to poor sales and a last-ditch change in strategy to save the magazine, but the timing now strongly indicates that they only did this to appease ELSPA as CRASH was scrambling for advert revenue, even offering low enough rates to justify labels taking out full-page ads for <span style="font-style: italic">budget</span> games.<br /><br />I was extraordinarily happy when I bought the first full-sized issue of CRASH magazine back in 1991, but the realization that they made the change before they were forced to rather than because they wanted to has taken the shine off of it a little. However it does add a little more colour to the history of the Cover Tape Wars, and is one of those stories which can only be hinted at in the documentary due to the lack of time to cover much in the way of detail.<br /><br />===== [ NEWS ] =====<br /><br />The fancy header is here for keeps <img src="http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/forums/images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> I'm going to have to create some sort of supplement to the documentary which covers tape/disk-zines as there was plenty of good stuff on publications such as Enigma Tape Magazine and FRED diskzine. Yet another thing to delay until the main documentary is finished. As ever, if you would like your project covered in the News section, <a href="http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/email.htm" class="postlink">email me</a> and I'll put it into the next Frontlines.<br /><br />== [ JET PAC BOOSTED ] ==<br /><br />There's a fun-looking project being worked on in <a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/forums/showthread.php?t=29981" class="postlink">the World of Spectrum Forums</a> where &quot;Whizzbang&quot; and &quot;Bad Beard&quot; have come up with an editor for the classic Ultimate game Jet Pac, naming it <a href="http://goodwiigames2.blogspot.com/2011/07/jet-pac-advanced.html" class="postlink">Jet Pac Advanced</a>. As WoS is sensitive about copyrights, and Ultimate has declined WoS's request to host their games in their archive, the modification is only available as a <a href="http://nugget.no-ip.biz/spectrum/JetpacAdvancedAYInstaller.sna" class="postlink">POKE loader</a> - just like old days days when we used to have to type in hacks which would be run before loading in the actual game in order to get infinite lives. Nice work - we need more modified games as they add another dimension to the classics.<br /><br />== [ LOOK MA, NO WIRES! ] ==<br /><br />Here's a fun homebrew project: create your own wireless USB Spectrum rubber keyboard to use with emulators. Sami Vehmaa has a <a href="http://www.vehmaa.se/swezxdiy/Swedish_ZX_Spectrum_DIY_site/ZXBT.html" class="postlink">webpage</a> how he created it, complete with instructions and rather fun <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwD4ueCyVj0" class="postlink">YouTube demo video</a>. Elite Systems are rumoured to be working on something similar with Bluetooth to tie in with their iPhone Speccy game compilations - more news on that as I get it.<br /><br />== [ ZX81 NOW 30 YEARS OLD ] ==<br /><br />The thirtieth birthday of the original ZX81 is being marked by the <a href="http://www.zx81museum.net/" class="postlink">ZX81 Museum</a> with the launch of a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/ZX81Museum" class="postlink">YouTube Channel</a>, which goes alongside their <a href="http://twitter.com/ZX81Museum" class="postlink">Twitter feed</a> and <a href="http://www.zx81museum.net/ZXAT1/newsletter.html" class="postlink">ZXAT1 newsletter</a>. There's still new software and hardware being made for the old machine, including the ZXpand, which is a combined 32K RAM pack and SD memory card reader.<br /><br />== [ ZX81 MUSIC VIDEO ] ==<br /><br />Talking of the ZX81, YouTube user <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/soundhog09" class="postlink">soundhog09</a> has recovered a fine oddity. Back in 1983, Chris Sievey (AKA Frank Sidebottom) released a single on 7&quot; vinyl which contained a song called &quot;Camouflage&quot;. Side B contained audio tracks you could load directly into your ZX81 for four programs, one of which you meant to run in tandem with the song and acted as a music video. It's remained lost and forgotten... <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u9ZyV-BHFA" class="postlink">until now - watch it on YouTube</a> in a video which uses the song as the soundtrack. Don't expect Pixar, but it's a nice novelty.<br /><br />== [ TWITTER FUN ] == <br /><br />Had a bit of fun on Twitter the other day by creating the #improve80sgametitlesbyaddinginmypants on a slow day. Quite a few people joined in with: Incredible Shrinking Fireman In My Pants, Chubby Gristle In My Pants, Granny's Garden In My Pants, Rolling Thunder In My Pants, Where In The World Is Carmen Sandiego? In My Pants, … you get the idea. Makes you proud to be British <img src="http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/forums/images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />== [ SPECCY MEMORIES ] ==<br /><br />jdanddiet (really someone quite famous, who I'm not sure has been &quot;outed&quot; yet, so I'll stay schtumn) has written a series on <a href="http://www.retrofusion.org.uk/" class="postlink">Retro Fusion</a> about <a href="http://www.retrofusion.org.uk/blog/35/spectrum-memories-part-1/" class="postlink">his own Speccy memories</a> - there's multiple parts to it and is rather fun to dip into.<br /><br />== [ YOUR COMPUTER - NO, NOT <span style="font-style: italic">YOUR</span> COMPUTER, YOUR COMPUTER ] ==<br /><br />It's been a while since you heard about new magazine archivists - whilst World Of Spectrum add page image scans of the full runs of <a href="ftp://ftp.worldofspectrum.org/pub/sinclair/magazines/ACE/" class="postlink">ACE</a> and <a href="ftp://ftp.worldofspectrum.org/pub/sinclair/magazines/PopularComputingWeekly/" class="postlink">Popular Computing Weekly</a> to its archive, few people are willing to tackle the mountain of OCR'ing that comes with transferring these to web pages. Meurglys68 has decided to tackle a <a href="http://yourcomputeronline.wordpress.com" class="postlink">Your Computer online archive</a>, and is already up to August 1982 - &quot;only five more years to go&quot;, he tells me. Keep at it, mate, it's surprisingly satisfying after such a long slog.

Hmmm... When I give YT the video which was encoded at 30Mbps bitrate, the 360p downgrade is juddery. However, encoding at 32Mbps gives us a smooth 360p downgrade - maybe a DVD version won't be needed... which is great as I'm doing the text overlays now and could use the extra width HD gives me.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=54">NickH</a> — Sat Jul 02, 2011 7:27 pm</p><hr />

I'm currently doing a short relaunch advert to put onto YouTube, and for a laugh I'm doing it as full 1080p HD. One unanticipated side-effect is just how large the video file is at the end of processing: about 4MB per second of video, and seeing as this advert is 1min58sec, the ~472MB file takes a bloody long time to process and upload onto YouTube.<br /><br />Yes, I don't own any HD equipment at home, and even my most powerful computer cannot play this video smoothly, so I have to upload it privately to YouTube just to preview the thing! YT's own 320p downgrade isn't perfect, but it's watchable. It's also poor enough to convince me to generate and upload an equivalent DVD-quality video to YT as well as the BluRay-quality one as the test DVD video file played back very smoothly on YT.<br /><br />Then there's the source image files - you can't skimp on the resolution of these files any more! Take a look at this frame:<br /><br /><img src="http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/fscratch/burst_frame.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />The adverts themselves are just over 1000 pixels high so look fine as part of a 1920x1080 image, but those 16x16 icons... yikes...! Fortunately they're fast-moving objects, so they're recognizable even though they don't spend too much time on-screen.<br /><br />The icons are from the &quot;Share This Anywhere&quot; menu you get at the top each webpage - there are over 370 ways to share this page using this app! Blimey.<br /><br />Still, the adverts look <span style="font-weight: bold">fantastic</span> in the full-sized 1920x1080 frame,<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=54">NickH</a> — Thu Jun 30, 2011 2:24 pm</p><hr />

Welcome to the first Frontlines, what will hopefully be a monthly feature containing my own meanderings plus news from the scene.<br /><br />So here it is, the relaunch of the Your Sinclair Rock'n'Roll Years website - not so much a relaunch, more a change of direction. The website will be celebrating its 15th anniversary next year, but it needed bringing up to date a little to reflect the changing ways that people are accessing it.<br /><br />Gone are the days when websites survived solely on word-of-mouth, FAQs, webrings and link lists. These days the YSRnRY gets its traffic mainly from search engines, social networks and non-Sinclair-related forums, meaning that people rarely come through the front door and know what the site's about and what it has to offer.<br /><br />So, the website design's been rejigged a little to integrate it all with each other. The highlights are now promoted at the top of each page so that visitors who come in via a side entrance still know what the site has to offer. There's also a presence on Facebook and Twitter - currently just the YS Daily Fix and site news on there, but there'll be other stuff over time.<br /><br />With most of the traffic coming from outside of the Sinclair &quot;scene&quot;, it looks as if there's plenty of casual retrogamers out there, possibly looking for a place to hang out in and celebrate the Sinclair machines in their own way, so a new set of forums have been installed on this website for them. Aimed at the more casual user (although everyone is welcome to join in), I intend it to be a light, friendly forum for people to enjoy in order to get away from Real Life Stuff - I find that surrounding myself with enthusiasts having a good time rather fun, and I'm sure you will do too. <br /><br />And why not join in creating something for the scene? It could be just a webpage here, and article there, or maybe even an online book. Maybe it wouldn't involve the written word at all and be a piece of software, or some music, or a video. Hell, if you're feeling artistic, then maybe a piece of art like a painting, a model, or sculpture. Anything goes, really, as it all helps to add to a rich, varied and enjoyable hobby.<br /><br />The payoff? Creating the YSRnRY has been a joy, and wallowing in old Speccy memories is seriously good for the soul. Sharing these memories with others not only reinforces them, but you share in the warm glow of others as they relate to you memories of their own. And remember, if you enjoy creating something, chances are someone else will enjoy seeing the results.<br /><br />As for me, well, Real Life Stuff seems to grow as I get older, but I'm still working on various things after a few months' hiatus. The Documentary will get a starting chapter and a finishing double chapter, hopefully done by the end of 2012 as that year marks all sorts of different anniversaries. I'll be posting up a new Frontlines entry on here every month or so, and will also report any news that comes my way. Above all, I'm going to have a bit of fun doing things that I hope you will enjoy seeing.<br /><br />====== [ NEWS ] ======<br /><br />How's that for a fancy header?! This relaunch has been ages in the making, and I <span style="font-style: italic">still</span> haven't done everything! Still, it's a bit retro - reminds me of the fanzines, tapezines and diskzines from way-back-when. Anyway, as this is the first News section, I'll just touch upon a few things you may have missed. If you'd like your project to feature in the next one, <a href="http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/email.htm" class="postlink">email me</a> and I'll put it in. Anything goes, so long as it's vaguely Sinclair or SAM related.<br /><br />== [ TOM-CAT'S RE-CRACKS ] ==<br /><br />OK, I'm sticking to the layout (such as it is) for now as it's growing on me! Tomaz Kac has a nifty sideline in modifying games to improve them by doing things like adding training modes, 128k music to 48k games, and my particular favourite, turning 48k multiload games into 128k single loaders. No more faffing around with TZX browsers! Playing Killed Until Dead is now a totally joyful experience - <a href="http://retrospec.sgn.net/users/tomcat/yu/TRDosReCracks.php" class="postlink">take a look at the games list</a> and see what tickles your fancy. And of course, if you still use original 128k Spectrums, you can record many of these to tape to load them yourself.<br /><br />== [ MONKEY BUSINESS ] ==<br /><br />Patrick Furlong's dropped me a line to say that a new demo of Monkey Island Adventure is in the works. It is based on Part 2 of 'The Secret of Monkey Island' and sees you on your second hand ship making your way to Monkey Island. Sounds like a nice bit of interactive fan fiction - sigh, I remember when we used to call them &quot;text adventures&quot; back in the day. Did you know that Ekim Drarreg is now a travel writer? People pay him to go around the world having a wonderful time on the precondition that he writes about it when he gets back. Not that I'm jealous or anything. Oh no. Moving swiftly on...<br /><br />== [ DUNC'S BACK ] ==<br /><br /><a href="http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/advancedlownmowersimulation.htm" class="postlink">Advanced Lawnmower Simulator</a> <span style="font-style: italic">still</span> has cult status to this day - one of those wonderful YSisms which has stood the test of time. A quick Google shows it's been remade over and over again, including <a href="http://www.youmustbejoking.demon.co.uk/als/" class="postlink">an online version</a>! Duncan MacDonald deserves the blame and the kudos for creating ALS back in 1988, and he's <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/LordScumland" class="postlink">resurfaced with a Twitter feed</a> with thoughts and jokes, such as:<br /><div class="ca-bbcode"><div class="ca-bbcode2 ca-quote"><blockquote class="uncited"><div><br />19th Century Word Club: DISGUISED IN WINE. (Drunk). Usage: &quot;I regret my behaviour of yesterday, sir. I was somewhat disguised in wine.&quot;<br /></div></blockquote></div></div><br /><br />== [ REMEMBER RETROSPEC? ] ==<br /><br />The truth is they never went away. Little was heard from them on the Speccy forums since the launch of their superlative <a href="http://retrospec.sgn.net/game/hoh" class="postlink">Head Over Heels</a> remake, but they've been really busy. There's <a href="http://retrospec.sgn.net/game/batman" class="postlink">BatMan</a> (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2uXAc09av8" class="postlink">short bit of YouTube footage</a>) (a remake of the 1986 3D game) by Tomaz Kac, and <a href="http://retrospec.sgn.net/game/kl" class="postlink">KnightLore</a> (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng-hseoEIhY" class="postlink">YouTube footage</a>) by Peter Hanratty for a start. There's plenty more where they came from. Old hands who remember Richard Jordan's Skool Daze/Back To Skool remake <a href="http://retrospec.sgn.net/game/ko99" class="postlink">Klass Of '99</a> may also be interested that he later went on to mash it up with HyperSports and Decathlon to create <a href="http://retrospec.sgn.net/game/sportsdaze" class="postlink">SportzDaze</a> - watching the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJM4YjS4cRk" class="postlink">YouTube video</a> of it brought a real smile to my face. You wait til you see the twist on HyperSports' archery event!<br /><br />== [ CRASHBACK ] ==<br /><br />There's a CRASH fan on Twitter who has been posting up <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/CrashOnlineUK" class="postlink">lots of CRASH goodness</a> from themed links through to general Speccy japery. Well worth a look.<br /><br />== [ THE LIST OF MOST IMPORTANT GAMES EVER - UNTIL THE NEXT ONE ] ==<br /><br />One of the things this site would like to do is promote everything and anything Sinclair or SAM-related - it doesn't have to be something megahuge, just something you enjoy because chances are someone else will enjoy it too. James Moffat's writing a series on what he considers the most important computer games of all time accross all formats, and the Speccy features quite nicely. <a href="http://jayodoom.blogspot.com/2011/05/my-most-important-games-ever-part-i.html" class="postlink">Here's the first part.</a><br /><br />== [ SPECTACULATOR ON iEVERYTHING ] ==<br /><br />Jonathan Needle (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/jonathan_needle" class="postlink">Twitter</a>|<a href="http://www.facebook.com/spectaculator" class="postlink">Facebook</a>) has produced a version of his Spectaculator Spectrum emulator that is available for the iPhone and iPad, and it transferable between the two. That's what I love about the emulator writers - no matter the platform, you'll still be able to play Manic Miner on it! If you have an iThingummy, it's rather reasonably priced.<br /><br />== [ GOT NEWS? EMAIL US! ] ==<br /><br />And that's it for the first Frontlines. If you have any news for the next one (start of August), <a href="http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/email.htm" class="postlink">email me</a> and I'll put it in.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=54">NickH</a> — Sun Jun 26, 2011 7:10 pm</p><hr />

Welcome to the Your Sinclair Rock'n'Roll Years forum! We hope you'll stick around and have a bit of fun.<br /><br />There are the following forums available:<br /><br />Documentary/Site News: Here you'll be able to find out and discuss any YSRnRY-related activity, be it documentary development and feedback, or website additions. I'll also write the odd news piece with info from around the scene.<br /><br />Your Sinclair, and other animals: The place to be for discussion about Your Sinclair and its related magazines, such as Your Spectrum and Zero, plus magazines which were heavily influenced by YS, such as PC Zone.<br /><br />The Games: The best, the average, and the true blue stinkers - tell the world what you think of the games which appeared on the Sinclair and SAM computers!<br /><br />Sinclair Misc: Anything Sinclair-related which isn't covered by the other forums.<br /><br />1980's Nostalgia: Fancy a wallow in memories of yesteryear? Come here and dive in!<br /><br />Whilst there are no forum rules as such, these forums are moderated, and will be moderated in a way to keep everything fun and light. Obviously you can't describe a set of rules which will tell you what's &quot;good&quot; and what's &quot;bad&quot;, but a good starting point is &quot;Be Excellent To Each Other&quot;. One other guideline: try to keep the off-topic stuff to a minimum - we don't mind the odd off-topic post, but we don't want the forums flooded with them. <br /><br />Irish comedian Dara O Briain put it quite nicely when talking about the differences between Irish and British approaches to rules and regulations. Whereas the Brits are very prescriptive, the Irish have basically three vague classifications. All the good stuff is classed as &quot;That's grand&quot;. The grey areas are classed as &quot;Ah, now don't push it.&quot; And then when the lines are crossed, &quot;Right! You're taking the piss!&quot;, and they're dealt with. Moderation is done in private, and the moderator's decision is final. Questions about any particular decision may be asked privately.<br /><br />The dull stuff:<br /><br />For those concerned about such things, everything on this site is viewable by search engines. Posts are owned by the poster, but the forum owner reserves the right to publish them in any way that is desired. Edits may be made in the course of moderation. Post contents are the complete responsibility of the poster and the forum owner and moderators cannot be held responsible for any repercussions that may arise from them. Only one username per person allowed - if you think you have multiple voices, see a specialist.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=54">NickH</a> — Sun Jun 26, 2011 4:40 pm</p><hr />
