i remember a couple of funny fake interviews with arnold schwarzenegger.. was around '91 i think. one of 'm was about his love for violence and the need to stare at flowers and to pet little kittens afterwards to calm him down .. <br />Perhaps not THE best YS bit for me, yet one of the many funny things that spring to mind when i think about YS.  <img src="http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/forums/images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=84">Spray</a> — Sun Jul 03, 2011 2:25 am</p><hr />

Some of my favourite bits were the competitions they ran. Every Drop In The Ocean, the &quot;win your own Spitting Image Puppet&quot; one  and the one where they gave away a shed were just some that pop to mind. I never won anything, mind.  <br /><br />Other than that, I loved the letters from foreign readers (Guilty laughs abound), Kindly Leave The Stage, Ernie The Psychotic Madman, the YS themed shoot-em-up that was given away, the brilliant reviews, and and and..... Hell, I just loved YS.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=81">sweevo</a> — Fri Jul 01, 2011 12:33 am</p><hr />

What better way to kick off the Your Sinclair forum than that old favourite, the awards ceremony? We're now taking nominations for the best bit of YS (Your Spectrum or Your Sinclair) - the bits of YS which best defines YS-ness. There'll be a vote once we have enough. I'll kick everything off with the following:<br /><br /> * <a href="http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/pssst0490.htm" class="postlink">YS gets bought by Future and moves to Bath</a>, and Psst! describes how the YS team made the journey by train dressed as British Rail drivers. <br /><div class="ca-bbcode"><div class="ca-bbcode2 ca-quote"><blockquote class="uncited"><div><br />&quot;Don't forget the plan,&quot; whispered Matt as we took our seats. &quot;Pretend to be asleep. If the guard wakes you up, pretend to be Swedish.&quot;<br /></div></blockquote></div></div><br /> * <a href="http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/tzers0687.htm" class="postlink">The Great YS Coup of '87</a>. T'zers is hijacked as one by one the rest of the YS team kill off whoever's in the Ed's position in order to gain complete power over Castle Rathbone.<br /><div class="ca-bbcode"><div class="ca-bbcode2 ca-quote"><blockquote class="uncited"><div><br />Oi, I'm getting hungry. Ah, Sara, you're back. Where's my sarnie? You haven't got it? You're fired. Er, why are you rushing towards me with what looks suspiciously like a razor sharp meataxe? AAAAAAAARRRGGGGHHHH!<br /></div></blockquote></div></div><br /> * <a href="http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/runthegauntlet.htm" class="postlink">Bodie and Doyle argue about who's the hardest</a> whilst introducing Run The Gauntlet.<br /><div class="ca-bbcode"><div class="ca-bbcode2 ca-quote"><blockquote class="uncited"><div><br />Bodie: You're asking for a poke in the eye, you muesli-muncher. You're the weak-kneed glamour-boy. All the viewers know that if we fell out and had a fight you'd get the pips kicked out of you.<br />    Doyle: Ho, ho, ho. Says who - says a bloke who once played a handbag swinging, bouffant-hairstyled burk in The Cuckoo Waltz, a crap seventies sit-com!<br /></div></blockquote></div></div><br /> * <a href="http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/ghoulsandghosts.htm" class="postlink">Matt reviews the rather hard Ghouls and Ghosts</a>, filling up Jackie's Swear Box in the process.<br /><div class="ca-bbcode"><div class="ca-bbcode2 ca-quote"><blockquote class="uncited"><div><br />Mmm. Basically really good gameplayers with a lot of perseverance will find it 'just right', but ones who are a bit crap might get a bit put off. (What's that, Jack? Oh, I didn't say 'crap' again, did I? Alright, £6.60. What do you mean &quot;£6.80&quot;?)<br /></div></blockquote></div></div><br /> * <a href="http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/holdhand.htm" class="postlink">Whistlin' Rick Wilson sings &quot;Hold My Hand Very Tightly (Very Tightly)&quot;</a> on the cover tape, and a legend is born.<br /><div class="ca-bbcode"><div class="ca-bbcode2 ca-quote"><blockquote class="uncited"><div><br />When I met you on a rainy Tuesday<br />    Invited you around for some tea.<br />    Outside the weather was grey and gloomy<br />    But the sun's gonna shine on me.<br /></div></blockquote></div></div><br />These are the first five I came up with, and there's a gazillion more where they came from, but this is where you come in - which bits of YS should be nominated as the best bit ever, the most YS-ish bit of YS?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=54">NickH</a> — Sun Jun 26, 2011 4:58 pm</p><hr />
