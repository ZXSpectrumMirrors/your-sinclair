Wasn't it the Alcatraz loader which drew the screen in blocks rather than line by line? It also allowed for neat touches like a counter or even a scrolling message (Bobby Bearing).  <br /><br />The Players' Pac-Man loader was indeed very clever stuff.<br /><br />Hewson's RanaRama had an interesting loader, too - as the game loaded, the game's backstory and instructions flashed across the screen.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=76">Cultured_Janner</a> — Sat Sep 03, 2011 1:13 am</p><hr />

The animator inside me is twitching when I think of the different loading screen reveals. You know the sort of thing - instead of displaying the screen in thirds line-by-line before adding the colours, the screen would load with different bits of it revealing itself in various patterns. Couldn't find a good example on YouTube, so now pondering doing a batch jobby extracting videos of reveals automatically. Examples off the top of my head would be Killed Until Dead, 720 Degrees, Leaderboard...<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=54">NickH</a> — Sat Jul 30, 2011 8:56 pm</p><hr />

VU-3d was a terrific program.  I love early 8-bit graphical displays - there is something in their simplicity that I find endearing and aesthetically pleasing.  Maybe its a minimalism that was enforced due to the limitations of the hardware - the stuff we see nowadays is far superior but, I don't know, lacks a wow factor.<br /><br />@Warmtoffee: That Jasper demo of Spectrum Globeplotter was facinating.

You may think you’ve never heard of quadrature amplification modulation (QAM), but you’ve almost certainly heard it. QAM is a method of sending digital data over an analogue channel. It combines frequency (pitch) changes with amplitude (loudness) and phase changes. It’s the noise you hear from a fax machine, an old modem or a game loading on a Spectrum. QAM is also the basis of signalling in DSL and cable modems.<br /><br /><br />Just one of a hundred world-changing technologies listed by PCPro staff.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.pcpro.co.uk/features/368716/100-technologies-that-changed-the-world" class="postlink">http://www.pcpro.co.uk/features/368716/100-technologies-that-changed-the-world</a><br /><br />Nice concise explanations and I learned a thing or two.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=69">warmtoffee</a> — Sun Jul 24, 2011 11:22 am</p><hr />

I do remember the story regarding the colour clash frenzy of <span style="font-weight: bold">House That Jack Built</span>. They put an advert in Crash for it but were furious to find next issue that it was near the back and on the left hand side, always one to avoid. So they phoned up Roger Kean and told him to screw himself because they weren't going to get the money for the advert and since they were going to go bust, Kean would never find them. Hmmm, charming!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=70">Spector</a> — Sat Jul 09, 2011 10:30 pm</p><hr />

The worst I could think of was the Imagine collapse (but that was just poor management plus a small bit of manoeuvring ), plagiarism (the Harry Price games) and the odd bit of reviewing preview copies/screenshots. Can anyone come up with any better examples of the worst practices for the Speccy/SAM industry?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=54">NickH</a> — Fri Jul 08, 2011 3:42 pm</p><hr />

The whole concept of serial data storage is pretty much out of the window for me - I don't even deal with tape drives for backups anymore, we just get a SATA disk and plug that in.<br /><br />As for Lenslock, I preferred Monty Python's Cheeselock - one of the early versions of the &quot;find the word in the manual&quot; thingy.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=54">NickH</a> — Sat Jul 02, 2011 11:01 pm</p><hr />

For me the one thing that I was glad to see the back of was cassette tape loading. The sense of anticipation waiting 5, 10 or even 15 minutes for a game to load just to watch the machine reset itself was something that sent me into an irate twist. I know things improved with those speed-loader thingies but the advent of the affordable disc-drives could not come fast enough.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=77">Meurglys68</a> — Sat Jul 02, 2011 6:47 pm</p><hr />
