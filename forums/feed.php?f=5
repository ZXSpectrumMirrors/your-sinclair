Heh, it was a tad overhyped and the reviewed were a little OTT, but I liked it. Didn't hang well together as a game - more levels based on the first level format would have been my preference rather than the Space Harrier bit and the odd eagle bit at the end.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=54">NickH</a> — Wed Aug 31, 2011 7:07 pm</p><hr />

After all the previews for Savage, the game that was set to remove the colour clash problem on the Spectrum forever, I felt let down by the game once I got to play it.  I know it got good reviews at the time, but it felt too much like Altered Beast to me.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=378">pblive</a> — Wed Aug 31, 2011 2:02 pm</p><hr />

Deathchase <span style="font-style: italic">was</span> great in its day. More remarkably, it was all crammed into 16K - probably one of the last great 16K games, along with Jet Pac.<br /><br />Jet Set Willy I could kind of go along with... it was quite a remarkable game for its time, but too hard as well as being - infamously - impossible to complete because of the notorious &quot;Attic Bug&quot;, which had to be remedied with a POKE.  <br /><br />I think it was the hundreds of POKEs for JSW that vastly increased its longevity. Playing it with just the seven lives was dull by comparison, and usually made for a very short game...<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=76">Cultured_Janner</a> — Fri Jul 22, 2011 3:24 am</p><hr />

Deathchase is one of those &quot;good in its time&quot; games. Return of the Jedi was fresh in everybody's minds, and this emulated one of the best scenes in it. It's horribly basic, but I liked it back in '84 or '85. But it's so one-dimensional that it definitely isn't the &quot;best game ever&quot;, and even in 1986/7 it was showing its age. YS kept giving its rerelease 6/10 or so.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=73">Chuckie</a> — Tue Jul 12, 2011 2:43 pm</p><hr />

I thought it was a mistake by Ocean to make all their games from Navy SEALS onwards 128K only. I don't think a game like Pang for example really needed it, and it becomes a pain to load as a result. I never really got into their 1990s efforts because of that.
