Wasn't it the Alcatraz loader which drew the screen in blocks rather than line by line? It also allowed for neat touches like a counter or even a scrolling message (Bobby Bearing).  <br /><br />The Players' Pac-Man loader was indeed very clever stuff.<br /><br />Hewson's RanaRama had an interesting loader, too - as the game loaded, the game's backstory and instructions flashed across the screen.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=76">Cultured_Janner</a> — Sat Sep 03, 2011 1:13 am</p><hr />

Heh, it was a tad overhyped and the reviewed were a little OTT, but I liked it. Didn't hang well together as a game - more levels based on the first level format would have been my preference rather than the Space Harrier bit and the odd eagle bit at the end.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=54">NickH</a> — Wed Aug 31, 2011 7:07 pm</p><hr />

It's August, which means it's officially summer. As I live at the crap end of the country (weather-wise), I'm looking out of the window at a very dark sky whilst listening to Test Match Special. It's lunch time and I need to turn a light on. Joy...<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic">Anyway...</span> When I'm not caught up in Real Life Stuff, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flVY6I41W2c" class="postlink">creating a two-minute advert for the site relaunch</a> or writing silly scripts such as <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05Vh77qLMic" class="postlink">one which collected together a bunch of animated loading screen reveals</a>, I still dip my toe into researching for the <a href="http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/tvprog/" class="postlink">documentary</a>. Occasionally I get fresh insights into the goings on in the industry, and recently had a bit of a revelation about the infamous magazine Cover Tape Wars.<br /><br />As the documentary is up to 1990, you should know the story so far. You haven't seen the videos? Boy are you in for a treat - go <a href="http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/tvprog/downloads.htm" class="postlink">watch them now</a> and we'll still be here twiddling our thumbs when you get back. Twiddle, twiddle, twiddle. Right. Back? Good. As you saw, all three major Speccy mags now have monthly cover tapes, and CRASH  is pamphletized as they went all-in by stuffing their tape with re-releases at the expense of having a magazine with actual pages with actual articles in. I've <a href="http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/cgi-bin/advent.pl?day=20" class="postlink">commented on this</a> a few times, so I'll bypass the rant and go straight on to 1991.<br /><br />Of course, Your Sinclair and Sinclair User were rereleasing the odd game on their cover tapes, but when SU announced it was considering going down the CRASH route and beefing up their cover tape with more rereleases at the expense of shrinking the magazine due to having little new to write about, industry body ELSPA cleared their throat and complained. Reading the SU letters pages reveals that a little more went on behind the scenes. ELSPA not only complained, they also blackmailed the magazines to their way of thinking: cut down on the number of rereleases or we'll cut down on the amount of advertising from our members (pretty much every software house) - and, acknowledging that their advertising had gone down recently, they also dangled the carrot of <span style="font-style: italic">extra</span> advertising if the mags played ball.<br /><br />YS was pretty quiet on this whole episode, preferring backroom diplomacy to SU's swaggering, so they quietly complied. SU also complied, but then complained in their letters pages when the extra advertising wasn't forthcoming, implying that ELSPA had stiffed them - after all, SU was ready to switch to the pamphletized format and only backed away from doing so when ELSPA started clearing their throat. For CRASH, though, ELSPA's demands were devastating to their two-year-old strategy of shrinking their mag in order to cram more games onto their tapes. All this time I thought that their 1991 return to the traditional magazine format was due to poor sales and a last-ditch change in strategy to save the magazine, but the timing now strongly indicates that they only did this to appease ELSPA as CRASH was scrambling for advert revenue, even offering low enough rates to justify labels taking out full-page ads for <span style="font-style: italic">budget</span> games.<br /><br />I was extraordinarily happy when I bought the first full-sized issue of CRASH magazine back in 1991, but the realization that they made the change before they were forced to rather than because they wanted to has taken the shine off of it a little. However it does add a little more colour to the history of the Cover Tape Wars, and is one of those stories which can only be hinted at in the documentary due to the lack of time to cover much in the way of detail.<br /><br />===== [ NEWS ] =====<br /><br />The fancy header is here for keeps <img src="http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/forums/images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> I'm going to have to create some sort of supplement to the documentary which covers tape/disk-zines as there was plenty of good stuff on publications such as Enigma Tape Magazine and FRED diskzine. Yet another thing to delay until the main documentary is finished. As ever, if you would like your project covered in the News section, <a href="http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/email.htm" class="postlink">email me</a> and I'll put it into the next Frontlines.<br /><br />== [ JET PAC BOOSTED ] ==<br /><br />There's a fun-looking project being worked on in <a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/forums/showthread.php?t=29981" class="postlink">the World of Spectrum Forums</a> where &quot;Whizzbang&quot; and &quot;Bad Beard&quot; have come up with an editor for the classic Ultimate game Jet Pac, naming it <a href="http://goodwiigames2.blogspot.com/2011/07/jet-pac-advanced.html" class="postlink">Jet Pac Advanced</a>. As WoS is sensitive about copyrights, and Ultimate has declined WoS's request to host their games in their archive, the modification is only available as a <a href="http://nugget.no-ip.biz/spectrum/JetpacAdvancedAYInstaller.sna" class="postlink">POKE loader</a> - just like old days days when we used to have to type in hacks which would be run before loading in the actual game in order to get infinite lives. Nice work - we need more modified games as they add another dimension to the classics.<br /><br />== [ LOOK MA, NO WIRES! ] ==<br /><br />Here's a fun homebrew project: create your own wireless USB Spectrum rubber keyboard to use with emulators. Sami Vehmaa has a <a href="http://www.vehmaa.se/swezxdiy/Swedish_ZX_Spectrum_DIY_site/ZXBT.html" class="postlink">webpage</a> how he created it, complete with instructions and rather fun <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwD4ueCyVj0" class="postlink">YouTube demo video</a>. Elite Systems are rumoured to be working on something similar with Bluetooth to tie in with their iPhone Speccy game compilations - more news on that as I get it.<br /><br />== [ ZX81 NOW 30 YEARS OLD ] ==<br /><br />The thirtieth birthday of the original ZX81 is being marked by the <a href="http://www.zx81museum.net/" class="postlink">ZX81 Museum</a> with the launch of a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/ZX81Museum" class="postlink">YouTube Channel</a>, which goes alongside their <a href="http://twitter.com/ZX81Museum" class="postlink">Twitter feed</a> and <a href="http://www.zx81museum.net/ZXAT1/newsletter.html" class="postlink">ZXAT1 newsletter</a>. There's still new software and hardware being made for the old machine, including the ZXpand, which is a combined 32K RAM pack and SD memory card reader.<br /><br />== [ ZX81 MUSIC VIDEO ] ==<br /><br />Talking of the ZX81, YouTube user <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/soundhog09" class="postlink">soundhog09</a> has recovered a fine oddity. Back in 1983, Chris Sievey (AKA Frank Sidebottom) released a single on 7&quot; vinyl which contained a song called &quot;Camouflage&quot;. Side B contained audio tracks you could load directly into your ZX81 for four programs, one of which you meant to run in tandem with the song and acted as a music video. It's remained lost and forgotten... <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u9ZyV-BHFA" class="postlink">until now - watch it on YouTube</a> in a video which uses the song as the soundtrack. Don't expect Pixar, but it's a nice novelty.<br /><br />== [ TWITTER FUN ] == <br /><br />Had a bit of fun on Twitter the other day by creating the #improve80sgametitlesbyaddinginmypants on a slow day. Quite a few people joined in with: Incredible Shrinking Fireman In My Pants, Chubby Gristle In My Pants, Granny's Garden In My Pants, Rolling Thunder In My Pants, Where In The World Is Carmen Sandiego?

VU-3d was a terrific program.  I love early 8-bit graphical displays - there is something in their simplicity that I find endearing and aesthetically pleasing.  Maybe its a minimalism that was enforced due to the limitations of the hardware - the stuff we see nowadays is far superior but, I don't know, lacks a wow factor.<br /><br />@Warmtoffee: That Jasper demo of Spectrum Globeplotter was facinating.

You may think you’ve never heard of quadrature amplification modulation (QAM), but you’ve almost certainly heard it. QAM is a method of sending digital data over an analogue channel. It combines frequency (pitch) changes with amplitude (loudness) and phase changes. It’s the noise you hear from a fax machine, an old modem or a game loading on a Spectrum. QAM is also the basis of signalling in DSL and cable modems.<br /><br /><br />Just one of a hundred world-changing technologies listed by PCPro staff.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.pcpro.co.uk/features/368716/100-technologies-that-changed-the-world" class="postlink">http://www.pcpro.co.uk/features/368716/100-technologies-that-changed-the-world</a><br /><br />Nice concise explanations and I learned a thing or two.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=69">warmtoffee</a> — Sun Jul 24, 2011 11:22 am</p><hr />
