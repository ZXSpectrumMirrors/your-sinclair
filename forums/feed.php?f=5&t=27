Deathchase <span style="font-style: italic">was</span> great in its day. More remarkably, it was all crammed into 16K - probably one of the last great 16K games, along with Jet Pac.<br /><br />Jet Set Willy I could kind of go along with... it was quite a remarkable game for its time, but too hard as well as being - infamously - impossible to complete because of the notorious &quot;Attic Bug&quot;, which had to be remedied with a POKE.  <br /><br />I think it was the hundreds of POKEs for JSW that vastly increased its longevity. Playing it with just the seven lives was dull by comparison, and usually made for a very short game...<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=76">Cultured_Janner</a> — Fri Jul 22, 2011 3:24 am</p><hr />

Deathchase is one of those &quot;good in its time&quot; games. Return of the Jedi was fresh in everybody's minds, and this emulated one of the best scenes in it. It's horribly basic, but I liked it back in '84 or '85. But it's so one-dimensional that it definitely isn't the &quot;best game ever&quot;, and even in 1986/7 it was showing its age. YS kept giving its rerelease 6/10 or so.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=73">Chuckie</a> — Tue Jul 12, 2011 2:43 pm</p><hr />

There's a good game in Super Soccer if you persevere and look very closely. Once you figure out that 45-degree turns don't lose your player any speed, there's a good game to be had. If you ignored the bugs. The slowness brought in a bit of strategy.<br /><br />But give me Match Day 2 instead.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=73">Chuckie</a> — Mon Jul 04, 2011 10:38 pm</p><hr />

Out Run definitely should have been much better than it was - nice music on the 128 though, and the multi-loaded levels remained in the memory so you only had to load them once.<br /><br />Knight Rider - nearly two years in development and it was still an unplayable bug-ridden mess. <br /><br />Street Hawk - another big licence, another long wait from Ocean. Although this would have been a fairly decent game if it had been released in early 1985 as originally promised, by the time it actually saw the light of day in late '86, it was very ordinary.<br /><br />Nightshade - after Knight Lore and Alien 8, we were all wondering with lip-smacking anticipation what Ultimate would spring on us next. It was this. Oh dear.<br /><br />Mario Bros - a chance to produce a great Speccy platformer that went begging. Should have been much better.<br /><br />Ghosts 'n' Goblins - good reviews, but I was distinctly underwhelmed. <br /><br />Bionic Commando - I loved the coin-op, and when the Speccy version had great reviews, I bought it and promptly wished I hadn't. Don't know what those reviewers were on, but it must have been good stuff!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=76">Cultured_Janner</a> — Mon Jul 04, 2011 11:05 am</p><hr />

Difficult one this. I have always been one of those that see Spectrum games as the glass being half-full which meant that I would always try to concentrate on the plus side of any game (even though if I was being honest I did feel disappointed).<br /><br />Anti-Climaxes: <br />Arcadia - I am not sure why but I had convinced myself that I was loading up something that would blow Galaga/Galaxians et al, out of the water. When I finally saw the flickery graphics and flatulence sounding noise of the ship, I was a bit miffed. Still, continued to play it though.<br /><br />Cavelon: For much the same reason as above. However, this game did develop into a favourite. What it lacked in graphics/sound it made up for in gameplay. Still play the game.<br /><br />The Hobbit: Now I know that this was a ground breaking text adventure (or piece of interactive fiction, if you prefer), but it annoyed the crap out of me. Being a huge fan of Tolkien and having just finished Lord of the Rings for the first time a few months before the game was released, I was mortified when I saw the game. My dreams of taking on Smaug withered exponentially with every 'you can't do that' or 'I don't understand'.  In hindsight my expectations far exceeded what the Spectrum was capable of.<br /><br />All if which leads me to realise that none of the above constitute a 'biggest anti-climax' - I shall need to go away and ponder this more.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=77">Meurglys68</a> — Sat Jul 02, 2011 6:21 pm</p><hr />

RoadBlasters is up there - on 48K anyway. Psycho Pigs UXB appealed to me as it was an original concept, but the execution was terrible - love playing it in MAME, though.
